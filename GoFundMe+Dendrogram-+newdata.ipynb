I tell them about the value of hard work and that there is nothing you cant overcome if you have perseverance.Downer wants to expand his mission. He has created a non-profit 501C3 organizationcalled Teaching Involves Mentoring and Education (TIME). He hopes this organization will allow him to reach more young people.And he has a strong rapport with young people, many of whom are facing struggles of their own. Downers sits in an outdoor area in front of the school and talks with the young people about the challenges they are going through.

Orphaned at an early age, Ashley and his younger sister were raised by their maternal grandparents in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Ashley discovered his love for soccer when he was very young. As his passion grew, so did his talent; he could be found playing soccer every chance he got and he began to stand out amongst his peers. After multiple campaigns with Zimbabwes Youth National Team, Ashley was given the chance of a lifetime: to attend boarding school in Alexandria, Virginia. In 2012, he left his remaining family and friends in hopes of making something of himself in America.During his time at boarding school, Ashley worked hard in the classroom, which was no small challenge. He also continued to excel on the soccer field. His play caught the eye of several college coaches which manifested in a offer to play at the Division II level in the mid-Atlantic region. Ashley worked incredibly hard to secure a full scholarship for tuition, but unfortunately this does not cover room and board expenses.Ashley has touched so many lives in his time in the United States, and the time to give back has arrived. In order to make his collegiate dream a reality, funds must be raised to offset Ashleys room, board, health insurance, and living expenses. Simply stated, if these needs arent met, Ashley will return to Zimbabwe and not attend college here.Every bit helps, no matter the size.

The school, demographically, based on the number of students receiving free or reduced lunch, is one of the poorest in the state. In an effort to prevent evening/weekend/vacation hunger among its students and their families, the school opened a no questions asked food pantry IN the school in 2013. Best friends Gabbie and Alice, knowing the school's dire situation, decided to hold a joint 8th birthday party, in which they asked for donations to the food pantry, in lieu of gifts. Their teacher, Mrs. Saulter, was so touched by their plans, that she secretly asked the PTO what they could do to make a big deal of these generous, selfless young ladies. PTO President Jennifer Johnson thought what better way to celebrate them than to make their wish come true on the largest possible scale? The food pantry has operating costs of $5,000/year. Raising $5k would mean Gabbie and Alice made sure families in need were fed for an entire year. Raising $50k would feed this town in need for TEN years. And for $100k, Gabbie and Alice would feed needy kids in the school for TWENTY YEARS! With the food pantry funded for twenty years, the school would be able to afford to expand to include fourth and fifth graders, a much needed expansion for this small town. So please, won't you help us celebrate Gabbie and Alice's 8th birthdays by making their wildest dreams come true? What they want more than anything is for their classmates and their families to be taken care of. Every single little donation helps, and encourages not only these girls, but others that come after them, to embrace the spirit of community and generosity. It sends the message that even kids can make a difference in the world. It feeds a families in need. And it will make these girls' 8th birthday party one this community will NEVER forget.

       "  'Who Are We?We are David and LaTonya Whitaker of Taste The Love, a food service company of American Southern, Cajun/Creole and Tex- Mex cuisines in the heart of Tokyo. Our storystarts with Thanksgiving 2005. After moving to Japan in 2005, David & LaTonya Whitaker wanted to be with family for Thanksgiving. So we invited everyone we knew to our house for a Thanksgiving dinner. About 50 people came,ate and enjoyed themselves. The next year we did it again and more people came. This has been repeated every year since, only increasing in the amount of people coming most through word of mouth. We just wanted to provide a place of comfort that felt like family and a home away from home; Where everyone could experience true southern hospitality and the heart & culture behind great food and music. In 2013 Taste The Love\\'s was formed with the desire to bring a piece of our American home to the hearts & tables of Japan using fresh and local ingredients. That desire has grown into providing english/gospel cooking classes, catering and consulting services. However, Taste The Love is planning to expand its current operation to what has always been the dream; a food kitchen. It is our prayer that everyone who cooks in our classes or eats in our kitchen can taste the love therefore feeding both the stomach and the soul. & Taste The Love / 200520051502013Taste The LoveWhat Do We Want To Do?By summer 2015 we would like to open the Soul Food House, a southern cajun/creole kitchen and gospel cooking school in Tokyo, Japan. We want to provide a space where people can come as they are and have a great dining and learning experience.To be more exact we want to:1. Offer English Gospel Cooking Classes1 2. American Style Lunch Bentos using local & fresh ingredients.2. 3. Provide an evening Southern Hospitality dining experience & offer take out during that time.3.4. Offer products, such as spices, sauces and dressings to assist in recreating meals at home easier.4. (Taste The Love )\\n\\nWhy Are We Trying To Do It?1. Feed my sheep is the message that rest in the heart of Taste The Love.1. Growing up in the South, we have come to know good food from the heart, that is filled with love, builds community. That\\'s the heart of southern hospitality. It feeds the belly, the heart and soul. We also want to educate individuals on what American food is, destroying the misconception that our main foods are only hamburgers, hotdogs and pizza.2. Japan has a growing consumer interest and demand for quality international food, with a love of American food in particular. However, it is important to cook and teach food that is quality, and has an authentic American taste but is compatible with the Japanese palate and in a size that is appropriate for the Japanese.3. Not everyone does well learning English in a traditional classroom. Therefore we at Taste The Love would like to continue building customers skills through hobby English. Students will be able to learn English through cooking, music and relationships. Through Gospel Cooking Classes, We have seen student\\'s English ability improved more in 3 years than we could have imagine. As one student stated \"I just simple wanted to communicate with the teacher more and learn more about the food and music, so I studied more.\" That regular student went from barely being able to formulate a sentence to translating for the teacher and all within 2 years.Taste The Love )32What the financial goal is We are aiming to raise $250,000 (27,000,000).

She would spend countless hours teaching us how to become other characters on the stage, but she spent even more time teaching us how to become ourselves. She celebrated every curtain call with us, as well as every college acceptance or personal success. She was there for us during our most formative years. She loved us and believed in us and dreamed with us.She was more than a high school teacher to us. She was our drama mama. And we love her dearly. Ms. Miller and Dylan at the White House, Ms. Miller and Kevin after Footloose.We were elated when we found out she wanted to share her love with a baby through adoption. We began talking about what names we liked best, what books we would read to her child, and who would be the best babysitter. We were excited to welcome this baby into a big village. Ms. Miller with Nephew Hunter.Last month, we were ecstatic to learn that an expectant mother from the West Coast expressed interest in Ms. Miller. But several days later, Ms. Millers adoption agency declared bankruptcy, abruptly and permanently closing overnight. Ms. Miller had spent years saving money and meeting with financial advisors to cover her adoption expenses. Adoption agencies require substantial upfront payment, and Ms. Miller invested thousands in this agency, with confidence that they were one of the oldest and largest agencies in the country. When the agency declared chapter 7 bankruptcy, Ms. Miller discovered that she and other former clients should not expect to get the money they paid to the agency back. As you can imagine, this is a huge financial setback. Fortunately, the expectant mother reached out to Ms. Miller after the bankruptcy, and still wishes to move forward with an adoption placement plan. Ms. Miller has found a new set of lawyers and a new adoption agency to re-do her home study and other paperwork. This means paying again for services she had previously paid for through the bankrupt agency. Ms. Miller with her sister and mother.We need your help to keep these new expenses from standing in the way of making this dream a reality. This placement could happen in mid-May, and we want to help Ms. Miller get to the West Coast to be there for the babys birth. Please share this page widely and give whatever you can to this incredible drama mama. While we are still waiting and while so many unknown variables remain in the air, we are undoubtedly sure of one thing: witnessing Ms. Millers resilience, grace, and love have reaffirmed our belief that Ms. Miller is ready for this child.

He recently set a goal for himself: Ashton wants to break the Guinness World Record for longest hair, and then donate the hair to kids with cancer. What parent could say no to that? Ashton had been growing his hair out for almost 2 years when his school, Rapides Parish, said he couldnt return to school until he cut his hair. We were shocked. Ashton, a great student who had never been in trouble, was being denied his education because his hair was too long. Ashton's school should be applauding him for wanting to help kids with cancer, not punishing him. Schools should not use hair length to determine whether or not a child is fit to attend. Tell the Rapides Parish School Board to end its policy on hair length.In this day and age, I never thought the length of a students hair would be a concern of our public schools. I never imagined a beautiful goal could get him expelled. Had Ashton been a girl, this wouldnt be an issue. That is wrong and I will not allow my sons dream to be crushed because of an outdated policy.Ashton is a good kid. He gets good grades and is always on his best behavior. My son stands up for other kids when they are being bullied. These should be the things that the school should use to measure whether he is fit to attend classes. Instead, the school wants to measure his hair.With your help we'll not only make sure that Ashton can realize his dream of helping kids with cancer, but also end an outdated policy that discriminates against students based on their hair length.I ask please help me in my fight against gender discrimination and the freedom to have long hair.#LongHairFreedomTHANK YOU!!! :-)\"),\n",

However, my transcript and diploma will not be released because I have a tuition balance at Tulane. My family cannot afford to help me due to the terrible economic situation in Brazil right now. Most of my friends who live there now are unemployed and cannot help me financially either. Since I am not an American citizen, I cannot ask for a loan, unless I have an American co-signer. I am a Dean's List student, who has published two research articles, and I am also a recipient of the William F. Canning Award for Excellence, Leadership and Performance. I have asked the university for a higher scholarship since I have proven that I am committed and dedicated to my studies and work, however, Tulane says there is a maximum amount that can be given to international students, and I have already reached such amount. In addition to being a full-time Chemical Engineering student, I have two jobs. I work more than 30 hours a week while taking 19 credit hours. I also babysit, dogsit, and tutor. Still I cannot afford to pay my remaining balance. This is my last semester in school  actually, my last few days - and I desperately need help. I need to pay this balance ASAP or I will keep being charged finance charges because it is past due. My classes at Classes at LSU start on August 22nd, and I must provide my transcript and diploma to them within a month after that date. I would not be able to express in words how much graduating means to me. I never thought I would get this far coming from such a small city in Brazil and, especially, from such a poor and uneducated family background. I have had help from a lot of friends, who have fed me, given me a place to live, and a shoulder to cry on. I am not giving up now and I really need your help. Your donation will change my life forever, and one day I am sure I will be able to repay every single person who has helped me thus far. Please help me graduate and get my diploma. You will certainly impact my life with your donation. No matter the amount you can contribute.\"),\n",

In addition to our diversity we hold between us a powerful commitment to help create a healthy and vibrant future for the coming generations. We all agree this future must first start with our relationship to the ina, (the land).Climate change is a globally unifying issue that our generation must acknowledge and work with head-on. One of our missions is to build a bridge for the flow of `ike (knowledge) between Hawaii and the rest of the world. We come from the most remote place on planet earth, over 4000 kilometers away from the largest land mass. We are an island nation. Islands and coastal peoplesare many of the first communities to suffer the major effects of climate change. This means that our physical homes, families and culture are in direct danger zones. We feel that it is paramount to go to Paris to learn more about where climate change action stands today, globally. We want to bring home education and ideas on these vital matters to better inform and activate our communities here on Maui.We are eager to connect, share ideas and h (breath) with like-minded youth from all over the world. We especially look forward to meeting our indigenous brothers, sisters and elders who can teach us their ancient ways of co-existing with this earth. We are so excited to learn and make connections!Some important questions we are carrying to Paris:What is truly possible globally when individuals begin to take action locally within their own communities?How do we effectively get more of our friends, family members, work associates and acquaintances on Maui to take greater and immediate responsibility through their own actions to address the larger issues of consumption and waste that are robbing from the health of the aina and the earth?How can we better make the connection between the global movement against GMO and Hawais key role as a GMO seed production hub and as an open-air experimental lab for bio-techs industrial chemical agriculture? How can we make this knowledge more accessible and understood by the wider public? What larger role might Maui and Hawai`i take in the global movement against GMO agriculture?What role might Hawai`ian cultural understanding and traditional land stewardship practices have to inform global transformation toward a just, peaceful and ecologically vibrant future?What can be learned from the international indigenous leaders, youth activists, economic and ecological innovators who will be in Paris that can inform our ability to better care for the aina of Maui and Hawai`i?In order to pull this off we will need the support of our community! Our trip in total will cost $30,000. This includes all of our airfare, accommodation, food and registration for events. Your donation istax deductible!

Please take a moment to read the story of my husband Greg and his battle with Multiple Sclerosis. The last few years have been quite challenging to say the least. We have gone through the process of a variety of treatments in order to curb Greg's rapid decline in health and mobility, but sadly even with the help of pharmaceuticals and western medicine, Greg still suffers frequent flare ups and has lost a significant amount of strength in both legs. MS is both a physically and emotionally draining disease, not only for the person with the disease but for their support system as well.

Yoni is the most amazing person we know. He has a kind a loving heart. When he was younger, he decided that he wanted to become a dentistso that he could help people who otherwise could not afford treatment. He worked his way through school, and graduated from dental school a little over a year ago. He has already changed dozens of people's lives for the better. Yoni makes everyone around him smile with his sense of humor and positive attitude. He does everything he can to help other people. The world is a better place with Yoni in it.  Yoni has insurance, but his insurance does not cover all of the costs of treatment. He is drowning in student debt, and struggles to pay off his normal expenses as is. Even though he really needs your help,he would never ask for it because Yoni has always put other people's needs before his own. Please help our family.

An update: Yoni had consultations at separate hospitals today to discuss his treatment options. Yoni is a fighter, and his treatment is going to be very aggressive. We will keep you updated on his progress as information comes out. Lets keep the momentum going so that Yoni can make the best medical choices during every step of his grueling journey!

I saw him a few days ago and he was his vibrant, shady, loving self but it seems its taken a turn since then. He started chemotherapy which of course has drained his body. Pneumonia hit this past weekend, his white cells have depleted and his breathing has become labored. Thankfully, the hard work of his loving doctors have proved to be aiding in his healing process. The pneumonia has become less severe, Eric has been able to acknowledge his family in his hospital room, and will hopefully begin receiving visitors again soon. He has incredible doctors by his side and even better his mom and brothers. Now he needs us.He's taken a leave from Kinky Boots, his mom has taken a leave from her job and her every day life in St. Louis, and one of his brothers is moving to NY from STL after Eric leaves the hospital to aid in his care full time. This is a huge financial burden. Rent, food for him and his family, transportation to and from hospital and rehab appointments, his gorgeous dog (Niko), and of course all the medical bills. I know he is loved by so many of you and if you could make even the smallest donation it would help tremendously. If theres one thing I know about this man is if someone needed your back he would be the first one there.There are a few wonderful people that will be updating all of you with his recovery, but we will keep most, if not all updates, directly from his mother.

       "  'Anthony\\'sJourney through MELAS          My name is Danielle Capece(Lorenzo). My son Anthony was about 8 months old when he started showing weakness and no strength in thecore of his neckor back. Sitting up was a huge task and he didn\\'t portray normal activitiesthat toddlers accomplish through thestepping stones of life. I always wondered why Anthony never asked for myhelp orwhy he neverreally cried. He was the son anymom would wish for and that anyone wouldsay \"parenting is so easy!\" Hewasso good, with a passive behavior and so alert with a smile that would light up the room. As an educator, I knew in my heart something was wrong whenhe never crawled, when he played in his own world and when he would just point at objects that he wanted. I used my intuition and hadhim tested butafter two denials of services, I didn\\'t give up. I couldn\\'t pinpoint what was happening, but at18 months he was diagnosed with autism and wasgranted ABA, Speech, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy to help him with all his needs. As he grew he became stronger and more articulate, but I still felt there was a disconnect. Anthony tip toedwhen he walked or ran,he couldn\\'t lift himself up without help or grabbing on to thingsand hewasunable towalk up and down the stairs without holding on to the railing or crawling up and down. As he ate, he had to be fed because he was unable to hold a fork or spoon to feed himself. In addition, he was unable to drink from a cup without choking and was never able to drink without a straw. Anthony\\'s body had no definition on his arms, legs andface. He stayed so young looking with no maturity to his face or tone to his body andstill no strength. He didn\\'t gain weight or grow like other children his age.With so many signs and no answers I wasalways searching for answersbutIknew there was a missing link. Then the day camewhen the pieces of the puzzle started to form.Theperfect day on April 23,2016 became a nightmare! All day, my son was playing and full of life riding his bike and playing outside. That night my son started to look as if he was having a bad spasm and suddenly his whole body was jerking and his head went back gulping for air and turning completely blue. All I thought about was whyis this happening to my baby?As he was gasping for a breathe, all I could do was turn him to his side and wonder what was happening?? Through the screaming of fear , I watchedhis eyes rolling back and all Icould do was pray that my son would breathe and that he wasn\\'t losing oxygen to his brain. The fear I felt in 3.5 minutes felt like an eternity. When the jerking of his body finally stopped and his body began to relax, all I can see was a blank \"deer like\" stare and he wasnon -responsive. All I can say through my tears was \"Anthony can you hear me?\" but all he did was look through me. As hecame out of the frozen stare and began to cry, I held my baby so tight ,rocked him and told him \"it was going to be OK\". Unfortunately, the seizures continued and my nightmare was progressively getting worse. As the EMS arrived, he continued to have another seizure. The cluster of seizures occurred every 15-20 minutes. While traveling in the ambulance, he was crying saying \"I want to go home\"; I\\'m tired,\" but as we approached the emergency room my son was so weak and non- responsive. As we met with a team of doctors, they reassured us that the medicine being administered would calm his brain from seizing. After a battery of tests which monitored his brain for three days, he would now be medicated on seizure medicine(Keppra) for life.The seizures continued a week later with the same pattern and my son was turning blue and his chest was contracting with no air . The minutes passed watching and hoping they would end .Post- ictal set in which is an altered state of consciousness thatlasted with no response from my son for 15 minutes! There was no communication with a trance like stare as we waited for help.This continued for months until we got answers as to why the seizures were taking place.Also in searching for why Anthonywas so weak, genetic testing was ordered to help us understand why my son was deteriorating.\\n\\nAnthony, mylovable 5 -year- old, was diagnosed with a RARE INCURABLEgenetic disorder called MELAS which is a form of Mitochondrial Disease. Anthony wants to be a typical boy his age but he has always had struggles through the years with language, muscle tone and his lack of energy. Always searching for answers, I knew there was a missing link. This rare metabolic disease is robbingAnthony of the energy his body needs to function.The Powerhouse ofAnthony\\'sdaily life has been affected. Simple everyday tasks such as playing, eating, digesting, walking, running ,drawing or even writing are difficult activites for him.Anthony\\'s daily life has been compromised in so many ways. He is a weak boy who struggles with everyday routines. His coordination is lacking which leads him to have no balance therefore he is unable to jump, run and go up and down the stairs. His energy level is depleted quickly during ANYdaily activity such as eating, playing and exercising which forces him to sleep. A prolonged rest period allows for his energy to refueland for cell recovery. The importance of drinking and maintaining a certain amount of calories per day is a neccessity so that his body does not become stressed causing seizures. Anthony washospitalized due to uncontrallable seizures and weakness due to this horrible disease. Due to his lack of daily calorie intake, Anthony hadsurgery to get aGIFEEDING TUBE. The tube willgive him all the nutrients he needs to mainatin his daily nutritional value. Anthony\\'sphysiological stress on his body causes him not to be able to regulate his own body temperature. He does not sweat, however when he feels hot he seems to \"wilt\" and needs to be placed in a cooler environment and drink constantly to regain his energy levels. This disease kills more children every year than ALL childhood cancers combined.This incurable disease has NOcurrent or proven treatment for a cure. Although there is no medicine for this disease, specialists have placed him on a non- insured research based vitamin cocktail and Arginine that costs $700.00 a month. In addition, the cost for the feeding tube supplies will be $450.00 a month. This is a financial burden on Anthony\\'s family.  Due to a minimal amountof doctorswho specialize in this disease, the insurance companies DO NOT cover MOSTmedical expenses or research basedmedications. Therefore, all expenses are out of pocket and we need your HELP for a very special boy who has touched the lives of his family and friends in so many ways. Please help us give Anthony the ability to slow down his disease and the freedom to make wonderful childhood memories.---------------------------------------------------------------------Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondrial disease result from failures of the mitochondria. When mitochondria fail, less and less energy is generated within the cells. The specialized organelles that act like a digestive system which takes in nutrients, breaks them down, and creates energy molecules for the cell. Mitochondria are responsible for creating more than 90% of the energy needed by the body to sustain life and support growth. Diseases of the mitochondria appear to cause the most damage to cells of the brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscles, kidney and the endocrine and respiratory systems because these systems require a great deal of energy.

I asked her if he was ok and she didnt think so. I told her to call 911. She did. They got there about 15 min after the incident happened. My husband and I left work and went to the hospital to be with our 8 month old baby boy. The doctor at the Ionia hospital advised us that he had a concussion and needed test. They did a head and neck ct scan. The doctor came in with the terrible news.....my little baby had 3 skull fractures. He advised us that our baby needed to be transfered to another hospital. He also said that it wasnt medically possible for him to get this major head trama from falling back from the sitting position and that he had to report this to the authorities. He said they needed to do a full body ct to check for other injuries. He came back with those results and it appeared that his ribs were broken. The ambulance then showed up and took us to the Helen Devos Childrens Hospital in grand rapids mi. Upon arriving here they wanted a pediatric radiologist to review the scans. They did blood work and full body xrays. After waiting for what seemed to be forever the neurosurgeon came in to explain the injuries. She told us that he had 3 skull fractures one of which is a depression fracture meaning it is caving in towards my babies brain. She told me my baby needed to stay the night and would need to meet with different doctors tomorrow. I stayed the night with him. My husband didnt.....he had to work the next day in order to support our family. The doctor advised us that these fractures didnt happen from the story the babysitter was giving. Then the really tough news came. She told me the broken ribs are conserning as well because they are almost healed....meaning they didnt happen at the same time. That being said we were now under investigation. Our family felt heartbroken. How could someone hurt our baby...our sweet baby. I stayed with Thomas and the hospital appointed suppervisor. The next day came and we meet with TONS of people regarding our sons health and the investigation as to how he obtained the head wounds, the older broken ribs, and a newly discovered leg fracture. My husband went to work that day (friday, aug 5) but cps, cpc, and the detective had questions for him so he had to leave right away. This day our son met with nurosurgery again they said he was doing great and that as of right now he wouldnt need surgery. They gave us a list of stuff to watch for. He met with physical, occupational, and speech therapy. They said he would need multiple outpatient follow ups becsuse he wasnt moving his extremities equally. He met with the orthopedic limbs specialist about his broken leg. They said he needs follow up scan in 12 days to determin what to do. During all of this my husband and i were told that we couldnt take our babies home...either of them. Cps placed our older son with a family member and he had to have a full abuse work up done. We were told that Thomas would be discharged as long as his pending eye exam was good. We waited the rest of the day for the eye doctor to come. My husband left to pack up things for our boys to have while staying at my sis inlaws house. Around 4:35 on friday august 5th i recieved a call from cps. He told me that we could take our boys home and that our babysitter had just admitted to THROWING my son......my precious 8 MONTH OLD BABY!!! She THREW him. I was outraged. I told my husband the horrific news. He brought our older son in for his abuse testing. Thankfuly nothing was wrong with him. The eye dr came in about 9pm on friday. He did his test and they came back good. We thought that was it....we were released to go home. We got home late that night. The next morning we woke Thomas up about 8:30 becsuse he was still asleep. He drank his bottle and then about 9 am dad fed him his breakfast. In the middle of eating he did something strange.....he zoned out. We waved our hands, clapped, nothing got his attention. We thought mabey he was out of it from just being tired. Then around 4pm we were at our neighbors house and our neighbor was making faces at him and he was smiling and talking and then he just suddendly passed out. He was like a rag doll. When he came to he was in that zoned state again. We brought him back to Devos. They did a ct scan again. They discovered that he now has a brain bleed. Our sweet baby also started having abnormal eye movement. The neurosurgeon decided to admit him and start seizure meds. So thats where were at now. Our son Thomas, my husband, and myself are at the hospital. The plan for now is in a few hours he will have an EEG to monitor for seizure activity and an mri to check the brain bleed. We are praying those test come back well. Please pray for our sweet baby and our entire family. If you are able to leave a donation it would be appreciated soo much. If not a prayer for our family would be amazing.\"),\n",

       "  'Adam Wohlstattar has been a childhoodeducator for 15 years in the northern Los Angeles area (specifically Ventura County); the last 6 years as Assistant Principal for amiddle schoolin Simi Valley. As a vibrant, successful 38 year-old who is married to a wonderful woman, Brinden (also an educator), and father to Greyson, an amazing 3 1/2 year old boy, Adam appears to have it all.But on June 10th, 2014, his world changed when he was diagnosed with an extremely rare, genetic neurodegenerative disease that currently has a fatal life expectancy of 6-10 years upon diagnosis: Prion Disease.\"Prion Disease?\" you may ask...Exactly.Most of us have never even heard the term \"prion.\"Our mission in this campaign is twofold: First and foremost,to help support Adam andBrinden with their medical expenses and travel costs to see research and medical specialists at University of California San Francisco Memory &Aging Center(UCSF), while simultaneously raising money and awareness of this disease that is grossly underfunded and relatively unknown, despite itsdevastating effects. Justfour months after his official diagnosis, Adam had to step down from his administrative education career and is currently on medical leavefor the remainder of the school year, so hemay focus on staying well and spending as much time as possible with his family.Saying goodbye to his staff and students was one of the hardest things he\\'s ever had to do, but maintaining his health and spending as much time as he can with Greyson and Brinden are his highest priorities.So what exactly is Prion Disease?A link to a website offering more scientific definitions and details will be provided at the bottom of this page, but to summarize in basic terms: we all have Prion proteins in our brains - when they transform into abnormal Prion proteins, symptoms similar to dementia begin to develop. Some cases are sporadic, but in Adam\\'s case, it has been caused by a genetic mutation. Adam currently has difficulties with his speech, handwriting, coordination, judgment and memory. Adam\\'s father passed away at the age of 47, whenAdam was young - he\\'s just learned that his father suffered from genetic Prion Disease, as well as his two half-brothers, who also passed away in their early life due to exact same diagnosis (one at 38 years of age and one at 43). Adam learned of this information upon his initial visit to UCSF last May, where he underwent two days of medical testing and blood work that confirmed the genetic mutation from the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center. Offspring have a 50% chance of obtaining this disease, so Adam and Brindenare very passionate aboutraisingawareness not only for Adam, but also forGreyson should it be passed to him. This beautiful family has more strength, hope, faith and love than most people ever experience; it pullsthem through this trying and terrifying time in their life. Though fearful, they won\\'t allow the fear to overtake the hope and optimism they have for a cure. Your donation will help support Adam\\'s current medical treatments and necessary travels to see specialists (of which there are very few in the country with the depth of knowledge for this rare genetic disorder), help their family with financial obligations while he is unable to work and also help fund research so that one day there will be viabletreatments, improved life expectancy and ultimately, a cure. There is much optimism in this field of medicine but greater awareness and more funding are vital. Thank you.For more information on Piron Disease, click here: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/cjd/detail_cjd.htm#264223058Note: this GoFundMe page was created by a friend of the family with permission. 100% of the donations here will go directly to the Wohlstattars and to fund Prion research(less the mandated fees by this GoFundMe.com).'),\n",

       "  \"Many of us know John as this lively young man with the dark sunglasses and a bright smile. He is an athletic, 13 year old who loves baseball. But what many of us didn't know was that he was very sick. Last Thursday he had a chest x-ray done which revealed a large mass covering his heart. The doctors were very alarmed at this and decided that they needed to complete a CT scan to get more information. The CT scan revealed that John was more sick than any of us could've imagined. They initially diagnosed John with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. John, along with his parents, Mike and Cyndi, we're absolutely paralyzed with fear at this news. John returned home and was asked to wait until the following week to have more tests done. However, on Sunday, Mike and Cyndi noticed his health deteriorating and rushed him to the emergency room at Loma Linda Hospital. Luckily they were able to get him admitted right away and start the testing immediately.Monday, May 15, John went through a rigorous line of testing and prodding, to which he handled every step like a TRUE CHAMPION. A spinal tap revealed that John had a rare form of leukemia (ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA T-ALL) . The best way to deal with the leukemia was to start an immediate regimen of chemo therapy. Even with more answers than what they had the week before, Mike, Cyndi and John were still fearful of what lay ahead. The biggest fear was that the cancer may have possibly spread to his brain. Last evening, John completed his first session of chemo therapy. And according to his doctors today, May 16, his white blood cell count has dropped in half, this is great news. Also great news was that they revealed that the cancer had not spread to his brain. Right now John is still in the hospital with a long fight ahead of him. He remains at Loma Linda Hospital with his parents by his side. We all know John is this little guy with a huge heart and a lot of fight in him. John, Mike and Cyndi appreciate all the positive thoughts and prayers that everyone has given. They ask that we all continue to raise them up in prayer and keep John moving strong on the road to recovery.\"),\n",

       "  \"This is my dad Lance. On Fathers Day June 15th 2014, a few hours before my sister Emma and I were supposed to take him out for dinner and a movie, he called to tell me he was at the hospital. He said he was having a follow up on a swollen lymphnode in his thigh that had been bothering him for a couple of weeks. While checking him in, the nurse discovered his lung didn't sound right. She then ordered a chest xray immediately. The xray came back and his entire left lung was opaque. His lung was filled to the brim with fluid, and it had pushed his heart over into the other side of his chest. A cat scan was ordered and everything after that seemed to happen very quickly. I've never experienced anything quite like sitting in a room with someone you love more than the World and having a doctor tell you his body is full of cancer. Its pretty Earth shattering, to say the least. You feel like the wind has been knocked out of you and you hope that at any moment you will wake up from this nightmare. Only you don't. We were whisked away to a room where we spent the next week. After several biopsies, a surgery, 10 lbs of fluid drained from his lung, and what seemed like endless poking and prodding, the doctors diagnosed him with stage 4 non-hodgkins follicular lymphoma. He started on chemo just 5 days after going in for a check up. His prognosis is good, however the medical bills are not.\\nChances are you probably know Lance. Sometimes it seems like everyone does. He was born and raised in Seattle and began photographing the local music scene at the age of 13.Earning a reputation with his energetic and honest photographs, Lance got involved in some of the most legendary musical movements Seattle had to offer, including working as the official photographer for Pearl Jam in the 1990s. His work can be found in some of your favorite albums, in museums and galleries around the country, and in any music publicationyou can think of. In the 2000s he took some time off from photography to travel the world with his own band, Seattle punk spectacular The Briefs. And in recent years he has spent time engrossed in a wide array of projects from curating installations for Nordstrom to traveling to Nepal anddocumenting the grass roots Sherpa cultural identity for their2012 Spring catalog Sherpa Adventure Gear.Lance has been in recovery for over 10 years and one of his greatest passions in life is extending the hand of service to help others in need. He has worked cloesly with the MusiCares foundation to assist other artists struggling with addiction. He's helped countless individuals on the road to recovery and he is always there. Whether its to offer a place to stay, a ride, an ear to listen, or advice. Now its time for us to be there for him.Lance is not the type to ask for help, so we are asking for him. And like many artists, who have dedicated their lives to a creative calling, he is without insurance. Cancer sucks enough but not being able to afford the treatment sucks worse. Lets help take one thing off his plate so he can focus on kicking some lymphoma ass.Ifyou have anything to give, it will help, I promise.Thanks and love to you all!*Due to the OVERWHELMING support and those who have expressed interest in contributing in the coming weeks we have opened our goal to allow additional donations.

She had SCID, Severe Combined Immune Deficiency. She had no T cells, no B cells, but she had T cell function. Savannah has spent her whole life in and out of hospitals and doctors offices. She has had to give herself weekly infusions, even twice a week for quite some time. Through it all she became an accomplished dancer, playing Clara in the Community Nutcracker and more importantly made straight A's all through school. It paid off when she graduated Valdectorian from Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. Through all of her medical issues Van (as we all call her) had one dream. It was to return to Duke where she was first diagnosed.  Savannah was accepted to Duke University to study pre-med and to eventually become a pediatric immunologist, treating children much like herself. Savannah has been at Duke for two years.

What is even more rare, is a person in my excellent health and young age battling this. Unfortunately, the stage of pancreatic cancer I have been faced with is so advanced that my best option is chemotherapy. Despite years of research for metastatic pancreatic cancer there is no cure. Nonetheless, many patients have had dramatic and durable benefits from chemotherapy. It is going to take a fight to help me and a fight I am ready for. It is going to take some serious help from not only my immediate support team but also anyone willing to help me beat the odds. At this moment Stanford has suggested a course of treatment including chemotherapy, possible surgery after my treatments and clinical trials, when available, for my particular rare form of cancer. In addition, we are working with Davis Fertility Clinic, to ensure that after chemotherapy my wife and I will be able to complete our family with a second child.Being a Kaiser patient most of these treatments are not covered under the benefits we currently hold.

       "  '\"Maddie\\'s Message\"October 23, 2007 was just like any other day in the Funk household. Madison and her brothers, Tyler and Alex, woke up, were dressed, and fed breakfast. I remember this day specifically; Alex wanted \"cheesy eggs\". I had been ahead of schedule that day, so cheesy eggs it was. Little did I know that this would be the last breakfast I would be preparing for Madison. This was a Tuesday, so Alex and Maddie went on a play date while their big brother was in school. Once home, it was naptime. Both kids were put down for their nap as normal. This is where our life changed forever. When it was time to get up, Aunt Yori (as Maddie called her) went upstairs and witnessed the most horrific site anyone could imagine. Madison was lying beneath her dresser. Unconscious. After several attempts by Lori and the paramedics, Madison was pronounced dead. Just that quick, our lives would never be the same. The only explanation is that Madison climbed her dresser. She was a climber. We would have never in a million years imagined that she was strong enough to pull her dresser over onto herself. Tyler was 12, and Alex was 4. All three of our children had used this dresser. In the coming days, it became abundantly clear... our story was not uncommon.Our daughter Madison died an untimely death that was VERY preventable. Our hope is to reach out to the millions of people who are unaware of the dangers in their homes. For the past seven years since Madison went to Heaven, we have incorporated different ideas that would help us reach the people outside of our inner circle. You may have seen me at local craft shows, sharing our story and giving out furniture straps. We also promote our storyusing Random Acts of Kindness to share Maddie\\'s Message to complete strangers. Over the past few months, I have realized if I want to continue to be able to share our story and provide free furniture straps in these types of venues and at this pace, becoming a true Non-Profit is necessary. This is where you come in. If you feel compelled to help, I would be so grateful. I intend to start the work to get our foundation incorporated and recognized by the state and federal government as a Non-Profit, therefore allowing us to raise money and in turn raise awareness on the this very PREVENTABLE tragedy.

I will name the race organization after I am given approval, but I'm starting this because the medical equipment company will sell a refurbished one for $2900 and the race season starts in August and I dont want to see someone die if the medical crew doesnt have a cardiac monitor that is functioning properly. Our race organization is non profit and says that we need to look at other means of raising money, so this is why I need your help. LIFE SAFTEY.\"),\n",

Cancer doesn\\'t care if you are young or old, rich or poor, where you come from, what color you are, if you have a family or are alone. Cancer is a silent monster that in some way has made an impact on most if not all of us. This past year my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time. We are so blessed because the doctors were able to catch it early. Not everyone is blessed with more time. So many people I hold dear are suffering because of cancer. What to do when someone you love so much is suffering? Pray of course. I prayed and prayed and this is what God has put on my heart. I\\'m going to do a 70.3 Ironman. The race is scheduled for July 20th in Racine, WI. I chose the amount of $3,000 because there are 3 events in a triathlon, so it seemed fitting. It also seems rather ambitious but regardless if I reach the monetary goal, I\\'ll be donating every penny to the American Cancer Society. I\\'m giving to the ACS because all different types of cancer wreak havoc on people\\'s lives and their families, not just one type. I will be paying for my entry fee, travel expenses, equipment, and all things race related. The money that is given here is going to the ACS, not to pay for anything for me personally.

So one evening 11 years ago, Joan M. Cheever decided to teach Daley, 13, and Austin, 10, a lesson. She made a big batch of spaghetti and chili, loaded it into the back of her SUV, and drove the kids around their hometown of San Antonio, TX, searching out the homeless. I wanted them to meet people who really had something to complain aboutbut didnt, she says.Food for the SoulJoan began accompanying a minister as he visited homeless encampments throughout the city, distributing hot, healthy meals she had prepared athome. The faces of hunger are not what youd expect, she says. Some people had been laid off from a good job, and before they knew it had fallen so far down that they couldnt get back up.CrowdsourcingA legal affairs journalist, Joan was soon devoting all her time to charity. She enrolled in the culinary arts program at St. Philips College, attending 8 a.m. classes several times a week. I am definitely not a morning person, she says. It was harder than law school. Joan founded the nonprofit Chow Train in 2011, tapping her social network of soccer moms, high school buddies and fellow board members of the San Antonio Public Library Foundation toraise $50,000 for a kitchen trailer and pickup truck. Some people write me a check just to shut me up, she says.Disaster ReliefNo sooner had she bought the trailer than a tornado tore through Joplin, MO, killing 161 people. Joan sprang into action, asking friends and relatives for donations to buy food and making the 600-mile drive to the ravaged city, where she served breakfast, lunch and dinner to survivors and first responders. Shes since traveled to LaPlace, LA, in the wake of Hurricane Isaac and to Brooklyn after Superstorm Sandy.Menu PlanThese days the Chow Train makes five stops in San Antonio every Tuesday. Local stores donate meat and bread, and area farms supply fresh fruits and veggies. The meals are three-course affairssoup, entrees like honey-ginger BBQ chicken and maybe Key lime pie for dessert. When Joan pulls up at events like the San Antonio Book Festival, shoppers can dig in as well. I ask them to pay what they feel the meal is worth, maybe a little more, she says. I rely on their goodwill. The 57-year- old also relies on husband Dennis Quinn, her BFFs and their spouses, and even her hairdresser to help cook and serve.But not everyone is happy about Joans efforts. In April, local police cited her for delivering her food without a permit. Joan, who cooked the meals in a commercial kitchen that she says had the proper permit, plans to fight her potential $2,000 fine in court.Clear-SightedJoans kids, who rolled their eyes during that first drive in 2004, have come to share their moms vision. Austin, now 21, was by her side after a tornado ravaged Moore, OK, in 2013. On a recent visit home from New York City, Daley, 23, accompanied Joan and three young cousins on a food run, answering their questions about the homeless. People tell me, I dont know where you find them, because I never see them,  Joan says. My response? Get on the Chow Train, and Ill show you.To make a donation, go to  www.thechowtrain.com'),\n",

Andrea hoped they would be able to find at least a few buried items in the devastation, but the house doesn't even have a floor - they can see straight through to the basement.

She told me that she is usually the one helping, she's not used to asking for help. The family does have insurance, but they are doubtful it will cover everything they need to rebuild their lives. There is also no guarantee of when the insurance funds will become available. They have immediate concerns, like a rental house and basic food and clothing. They will also have long term needs, like rebuilding their house and replacing all their basic household items.Andrea is already taking steps to bring her community together in the tragedy. Despite her loss, she is already thinking of others, using her connections to start a community outreach program.

Last night Max wasn\\'t acting like his spunky self and we took notice. This morning he was still lethargic and was gagging, and slobbering profusely. We rushed Max to the Emergency Animal Hospital. The veterinarian ran tests and came back to us with the horrible news. Max\\'s stomach has flipped. This is a fatal situation for a dog of Max\\'s size. The vet told us we only had a few days left with Max if we could not afford the emergency surgery which totals $4,200. Our minds were flooded with questions and thoughts \"that is impossible\" and \"how will we tell Xoey\" \"should we let her tell him bye\" Our hearts were shattered at that very moment.After much consideration we have decided that \"anything is possible with God\" and we can not let a member of our family go. Not yet. Max means so much to us and we will do whatever it takes to save him. If you are able to help in any way at all financially , we would more than greatly appreciate it. If you are not able to help financially, your prayers are just as greatly appreciated as well as needed. We hope to update you all very soon on Max\\'s condition.

We are overwhelmed by all the love he is getting and I'm so thankful for this amazing community. Please keep updated with his progress on his facebook page:FACEBOOK Page---Hi everyone, meetChance! As many of our followers know, our rescue does our best to take in these special cases similar to our very own Batman, the Awesome Wheelchair Dog. Chance is an adorable 2.5mo old English bulldog who was brought to the shelter and set for euthanasia. Poor Chance had suffered from broken bones and deformity of the arms and legs at such a young age. When we saw this poor boy we saw his drive to live and his potential. We know Chance will need a lot of love and support during this process so we are hoping with the help of the public, together we can give this little guy a second chance! Please help us share Chances story and consider sponsoring towards his ongoing care! Anything helps!FACEBOOK FAN PAGE: Follow Chances daily progress here! http://facebook.com/chancethespecialneedsbulldogBEFORE & AFTER PAGE: Past medical cases. http://lovesecondchances.org/success-stories/success-stories-categories/before-and-after/SPECIALIST VISIT SUMMARY: On presentation Chance was bright, alert and responsive. He was non-ambulatory but had positive motor in all 4 limbs. He has bilateral carpal valgus (90 degrees), laxity in both elbows, and bilateral tarsal hyperextension (20 degrees on right and 15 degrees on left). He was able to move his pelvic limbs and push off to advance forward. Crepitus was present in both carpi, both elbows, both stifles, both tarsi and both hips. We discussed the severity of Chance' multiple issues, poor prognosis to return to function (pelvic limbs have better prognosis than thoracic limbs), and need for extensive therapy (surgery and rehabilitation) for at least 3-6 months if not longer. Love and Second Chances Rescue has elected to repeat radiographs tomorrow and depending on the extent are considering surgery with Dr. Dearmin. I advised to continue passive range of motion, massage and tickling pelvic feet to initiate movement of the limbs, and to stop swimming until suture removal. Once the sutures are removed, Chance should return to see me for further rehabilitation therapy.UPDATE 04/11/2014: Chance after his first set of surgery.TREATMENT/SURGERY/REHABILITATION ESTIMATE:Below are the estimates of what his treamtent, surgery, and rehab cost maybe. This is based off of 1-2 surgeries (he may need another depending on recovery) and 3-6 months rehab estimate.VIDEO: Here are some videos of Chance in the early stages.\\n\\nThis was the first video sent to us when Chance was still at the shelter, he was so tiny and helpless!\\n\\nAdorable video created by Alix Vincent one of our amazing volunteers!\"),\n",

Will you help me with my endeavor?Top 3 Reasons to Spay and Neuter1. It helps to reduce companion animal overpopulation. Most countries have a surplus of companion animals and are forced to euthanize or disregard their great suffering. The surplus is in the millions in the United States. Cats are 45 times as prolific, and dogs 15 times as prolific, as humans. They do not need our help to expand their numbers; they need our help to reduce their numbers until there are good homes for them all.2. Sterilization of your cat or dog will increase his/her chance of a longer and healthier life. Altering your canine friend will increase his life an average of 1 to 3 years, felines, 3 to 5 years. Altered animals have a very low to no risk of mammary gland tumors/cancer, prostate cancer, perianal tumors, pyometria, and uterine, ovarian and testicular cancers.3. Sterilizing your cat/dog makes him/her a better pet, reducing his/her urge to roam and decreasing the risk of contracting diseases or getting hurt as they roam. Surveys indicate that as many as 85% of dogs hit by cars are unaltered. Intact male cats living outside have been shown to live on average less than two years. Feline Immunodeficiency Syndrome is spread by bites and intact cats fight a great deal more than altered cats. http://www.aspca.org/about-us/faq/pet-statistics'),\n",

       "  \"Since opening Muddy Creek Farm in 1962, Dayan Birchler has enriched the lives of countless people. Dayans earliest riders will remember Muddy Creek when it was just a 6 stall barn with no arena. Students traileredin for lessons that were held, weather permitting, in the middle of the pasture. The invisible ring was lighted by the headlamps of their cars. Dayan had the determination and the vision to see the bigger picture.For 54 years, Dayan has taken kids who could not financially afford to go to horse shows and taught them the value of hard work and strong character. She was a coach, a role model, and a disciplinarian to guide them in the right direction as individuals. At MCF, it has never just been about teaching kids to ride horses. It went far deeper than that. It was about how they spoke to their parents, how they treated their horse and treated each other. As a child, you dont recognize that. What you realize as you mature, though, is that you were also at MCF to learn how to be a decent human being. She gave these children responsibilities and taught them how to be good people. She gave kids who did not have the means to ride or show horses the opportunity to do it when everyone else said no. Dayan showed them that horses are not just for the wealthy, they are for people who want it so badly that they are willing to work as hard as it takes.Dayan has never looked down on anyone due to physical, financial, or other hardships. Throughout her career she has partaken in therapy whether it be for children, handicapped adults, or kids who had difficult upbringings. She was able to temporarily erase those hardships by helping them step out of that box. She had a student show on the national level who had been told she would never walk due to her physical disability. She taught a terminally ill child who adored one of Dayans trusty lesson ponies. When she became too sick to come out and see Magic, Dayan said without hesitation then well take Magic to her. Those who witnessed it will never forget the feeling of watching that little girl come outside to see the pony that she loved so dearly munching on grass in her suburban front yard.Dayans life has come with many of her own hardships. She has fought and won against breast and ovarian cancers, had twoknee replacements, two titanium shoulder replacements and a ceramic hip replacement. Through it all she has continued to fight and keep the farm alive for everyone. For many people Muddy Creek is not just a farm, its a family.Dayan has welcomed those in need, both two-legged and four-legged, for over half a century. She has made mistakes, but her heart has always been in a place of giving. Now, she needs help. Muddy Creek is under imminent threat of foreclosure due to delinquent property taxes. There is no safety net here. Should the property be foreclosed, It is unclear what will happen or where she, and the horses, will go. Should we successfully raise this money, Muddy Creek will continue to serve kids and horses for many years to come. Through the Current Agricultural Use Value (CAUV) program, beginning this year all future property taxes will be significantly reduced to a level that Dayan can support ongoing. The delinquent taxes owed total just under $27,000. By July 8th, 2016, $9,695 must be paid or foreclosure will be filed. The remaining taxes will be owed on a payment plan. We aimto raise the full $27,000 that is owed. ALL money raised will go directly to the tax bill. Should we raise more than $27,000, additional funds will be put directly towards maintenance of the barn.As you all can imagine, it is extremely difficult for Dayan to ask for help. She has always been a strong and independent woman dedicated to giving back to the riders under her charge. This is our chance to save Muddy Creek and ensure that Dayan's legacy will not end here.\"),\n",

       "  'Last December, I told you about the EPA\\'s decision to consider regulating flight pollution for the first time in history. The decision was made, laws are being crafted, and now on August 11th, 2015 the U.S. EPA will have a public hearing in downtown Washington D.C. on these proposed regulations.I registered to speak at this hearing and a Harvard lawyer from the EPA called me to inform me, repeatedly, that since I was the only registered speaker I probably shouldn\\'t even come:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxFhSk620dwNonetheless, I let them know I would attend the hearing and now there are other people registering to speak! I started thisGoFundMe to help me attend and record this historic hearing. I humbly ask you to let me represent you at this hearing, please support my efforts by donating immediately as time is very short.  https://www.gofundme.com/jimlee-epaI also intend to record this hearing and upload it to YouTube.This is what I plan to say at that hearing: In advance of the Paris COP21 conference this coming December, the Obama administration is \"acting on climate change\" by imposing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations on jet emissions. This stunning reversal comes after this administration\\'s previous efforts to kill similar legislation in the European Union. [1] The EPA is attempting to say that six greenhouse gases emitted from jet planes are a \"threat to human health\" under the Clean Air Act while doing nothing to address ongoing lawsuits over leaded aviation gasoline or the real health concerns of stakeholders (every human) worldwide: cancer-causing, heavy metal fuel additives, trade-secret chemicals, and aviation-induced cloudiness (AIC). [2]The EPA claims the authority to regulate aviation emissions under the Clean Air Act 231(a)(2)(A), a law that should protect us from the aforementioned poisonous pollution. However, the definition of \"pollution\" is being perverted to mean \"climate change gases\" in what can only be called a violation of the spirit of the law. Read it yourself: The Administrator shall, from time to time, issue proposed emission standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of aircraft engines which in his judgment causes, or contributes to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. [3]Here is the EPA\\'s sorry explanation: The Administrator is proposing to define the air pollution\\'\\' referred to in section 231(a)(2)(A) of the CAA to be the mix of six well-mixed GHGs: CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. This is the same definition that was used for the finding for purposes of section 202(a). It is the Administrator\\'s judgment that the total body of scientific evidence compellingly supports a positive endangerment finding that elevated concentrations of the six well-mixed GHGs constitute air pollution that endangers both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations within the meaning of section 231(a) of the Clean Air Act. [4] As you can see by the wording in the Clean Air Act and the EPA\\'s verbal ninjitsu, lead, barium, and trade-secret toxic chemicals clearly present a greater danger to public health than greenhouse gases, no matter how much climate science you pile up. Furthermore, Material Safety Data Sheets of aviation fuel and their additives almost always contain the same warning: \"DO NOT DUMP IN WATER.\" Yet raw fuel-dumping [5][6] or burning these dangerous chemicals and then dumping them in water is somehow safe? Finally, despite great efforts to find bio-accumulation or bio-magnification studies on precipitated aviation pollutants, none seem to exist.The EPA and Obama administration are ignoring the global outrage over the most visible climate change concern from airplanes: CLOUD CREATION.Do a search for the word \"chemtrails\" and you will see millions of concerned citizens who \"Look Up\" and wonder \"What in the World Are They Spraying?\" [7] Despite what you may think of the myriad of maladies attributed to these clouds, the global outrage is nonetheless clear. What is surprising part is that they are right to be concerned and so should you.The EPA\\'s claim that CO2 is a greater threat to human health than contrails is based on erroneous IPCC data that downplays the effects of contrails on our climate. The IPCC\\'s last assessment of contrail radiative forcing only accounted for \"linear contrails,\" meaning that any contrail that spreads out and turns into cirrus clouds was not accounted for: Because spreading contrails lose their characteristic linear shape, a component of [aviation-induced cloudiness] is indistinguishable from background cirrus. [8] The warming impact from cirrus clouds was therefore excluded from the Radiative Forcing (RF) and Radiative Forcing Index (RFI) figures of the research discussed on this site. Yet to get an accurate estimate of total warming impacts from aviation, cirrus effects should be included. Although uncertainty remains about the precise nature of aviation-induced cirrus-caused warming, we do know how cirrus clouds form, and that they have a warming impact. According to some researchers, this warming impact could be very significant. [9]How significant is the heat-trapping contrail conundrum? Contrails formed by aircraft can evolve into cirrus clouds indistinguishable from those formed naturally. These \\'spreading contrails\\' may be causing more climate warming today than all the carbon dioxide emitted by aircraft since the start of aviation. [10]Scientific understanding of how jet plane contrails turn into cirrus clouds is severly lacking but rapidly evolving. The latest research shows that cirrus clouds are filled with metal aerosols from human sources. It seems to be aluminous silicate material, which is quite common at the Earths surface. The metallic particles are also very variable. The big one that weve found is lead. ... comes from things like tetraethtyl lead in fuels ... still used in some light aviation.  So thats probably the biggest metal that we find, or the most frequent metal that we find. But we find a whole host of different metals, actually. [11][12]The following is from the IPCC\\'s own literature regarding metal particulates from aircraft exhaust: Aircraft jet engines also directly emit metal particles. Their sources include engine erosion and the combustion of fuel containing trace metal impurities or metal particles that enter the exhaust with the fuel (Chapter 7). Metal particles -- comprising elements such as Al, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ba -- are estimated to be present at the parts per billion by volume (ppbv) level at nozzle exit planes (CIAP, 1975; Fordyce and Sheibley, 1975). The corresponding concentrations of 107-108 particles/kg fuel (assuming 1-mm radius; see below) are much smaller than for soot. Although metals have been found as residuals in cirrus and contrail ice particles (Chen et al., 1998; Petzold et al., 1998; Twohy and Gandrud, 1998), their number and associated mass are considered too small to affect the formation or properties of more abundant volatile and soot plume aerosol particles. [13]Translated, this basically says that the last time someone checked (1975) aluminum, titanium, chromium, iron, nickel, and barium were \\'estimated\\' to be a small percentage of jet exhaust, and even though we find metal in contrails and cirrus, (as of 1998) we think soot is probably what is making them.The fact is, metal particles are making cirrus clouds: It would seem that you would have to change all of the aerosol in the atmosphere very radically to get a big effect on the clouds. But because mineral dust and metallic particles are such a small amount of the particulate matter  just a percent or two  it means that you only have change something about a percent or two of the particles to get a big effect on these clouds. [11][12]The latest research would seem to cast doubt on the IPCC\\'s assumptions and require serious consideration when addressing the real climate change impact of aviation.High altitude metals are likely coming from leaded AVGAS and jet exhaust. Small changes in atmospheric metal have large impacts on cirrus cloud creation. Cirrus clouds trap heat and likely have a greater climate change impact than CO2.As a result of these recent findings, I strongly encourage the EPA to consider expanding the scope of possible endangerment to include metal particulates and cirrus cloud formation from jet exhaust.If the EPA complies with the spirit of the Clean Air Act, they will protect us from metal aerosols attributed to Alzheimer\\'s, Autism, Cancer, and a plethora of other debilitating illnesses. If the EPA is truly concerned about aviation-induced climate change, they will regulate the production of contrails and cirrus clouds which change our climate our climate to a greater extent than the sum of the six greenhouse gases named above.It is the mandate and duty of the EPA to protect citizens from industries that concern themselves with profit and dollars per gallon and not with our well-being or their environmental impact.Regulating heavy metals and aviation-induced cloudiness will be meaningless without proper verification. For example, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) members sign a binding agreement to only use certain chemicals in their gas tanks, but as we all know, agreements and regulations are useless without proper verification.Therefore, I request that MANDATORY, RANDOM testing of jet exhaust be immediately implemented. This is the most important step the EPA can take to follow the spirit of the law, do its due diligence to protect us from harmful pollution, and get real-world data to improve future regulations.Most of the data behind this endangerment finding comes from research in highly controlled environments where most variables are known. We need real-world verification of non-ideal situations where fuel fouling [14] or improper maintenance end in vastly different exhaust particulates.To achieve random testing, I propose that the EPA randomly attach a trailing probe to both foreign and domestic flights, then collect and analyze the results to determine real-world exhaust constituents. Alternatively, ground-based LIDAR observations [15] may be possible over fixed, high-traffic areas. Either way you choose, we need verification and protection.In conclusion, the EPA should expand possible endangerment to include metal aerosols and cloud creation, create a verification system that includes all ICAO members, protects us from aviation pollution, holds violators accountable, and commits to better scientific accuracy for future determinations.------------- HEARING DETAILS ----------------DATE: August 11, 2015 - 10:00AMLOCATION: William Jefferson Clinton East Building, Room 1153, 101 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004.REGISTER:The last day to pre-register in advance to speak at the hearing will be August 6, 2015.

       "  \"There is only one thing more manly then growing an epic beard and that is shaving that epic beard for the purpose of rescuing 10 little helpless children from a life of sex slavery.Hi, my name is Aaron Smith and I am the owner of HusbandRevolution.com.At the end of November, I am SHAVING my beard that I have been growing for 2 years as a way to raise funds to literally rescue 10 little boys and girls from a life of sex slavery.When we hit the goal I will post a video of my wife shaving my beard right off. I am donating every single penny raised during the month of November to DestinyRescue.org to fund 10 (or more) rescues. Destiny Rescue doesn't just raise awareness or lobby for anti sex-slavery, but they actually send trained professionals into brothels to actually rescue these children. It only costs on average about $1500 to rescue one child. If it was my son there is no amount of money I wouldn't pay to rescue him.With my beard and your money, we can rescue some children.So would you join me? Every penny that is raised will be donated weather or not we hit the goal. But I pray that we surpass the goal so that we can rescue even more children.Now here are some photos of my beard journey for your enjoyment.The day I decided to grow my beard out.Beard before the beard.Truth!Awe look how cute my beard was back then.I mean my son. Look how cute my sonwas back then. Yeah, that's what I meant...Don't ask...Glamour shots with my beardThis is when I got my hairs did.Yes... that's Kirk Cameron with me my wife and my beard making silly faces.\"),\n",

       "  'We are Mary Beth and Dan Reardon, but these days we are better known as Mema and Pappy. We are setting out on a great adventure to start on foot in California and walk our way across the country back home to New York.We are using our life\\'s goal of crossing the country to help kids with special needs cross their own boundaries.Our walk will raise public awareness and financial support for inclusion programs like Athletes 4 Autism (A4A), which helps kids of all abilities learn how to make friends, stand up to bullying, and improve physical fitness while learning to play recreational sports.These fun and fundamental programs are completely free to families, which means the overhead costs to \"get every kid in the game\" need to come from somewhere. That\\'s where we all can come in.The whole idea of walking across the country started many years ago. It was a thought: kinda crazy. Now, we are 60 years old-- both retired-- and the thought returned. We have always been responsible in raising our family, but now with grown kids who have families of their own, it is our time to fly and be free; to explore and learn again.Our feelings of gratitude for where we arein our lives is overwhelming, so we wondered: \"how do we combine our desire for fun and adventure with our desire to somehow give back\"? As we tossed the ideas around, and our kids and grandkids got involved, it didn\\'t take us long to know who we wanted to dedicate our adventure to. We have been inspired by Lilly and the Steiner family, and their journey in the world of Autism. We are not the ones to speak on behalf of Autism, but to be inspired in the ways we have, check out the Steiners\\' blog: http://theautismresearchfoundation.org/category/michelle-and-lilly-steiner We are making the plans and trusting that this journey will work out just the way it is suppose to.Will you help us help Athletes 4 Autism?Our starting goal is $50,000.00, which will provide free sports programs to kids with autism and their typical peers. These sport programs adapt to the special needs of each individual child, while encouraging typical kids to understand autism from first-hand experience. In the process, kids actually begin to appreciate their differences and become friends because of them not in spite of them.All donations will be mailed directly to Athletes 4 Autism\\'s parent charity: The Autism Research Foundation, a 501(c)3 tax-deductible non-profit dedicated to helping all families experiencing autism, just like Lilly\\'s.P.S.

       "  'Hi! We are two high school students, Sahar and Mila, who attend the Arts and Humanities Academy atBerkeley High School in the San Francisco Bay Area. Were working together to fundraise for the Middle East Childrens Alliance (MECA) Maia Project. We are asking for your help to purchase a water purification and desalination unit, through the Maia Project, that will be installed in a kindergarten in Gaza, giving over 400 children access to potable water. Access to clean drinking water is universally regarded a basic human right. According to UN Resolution64/292, the United Nations General Assembly explicitly \"recognized the human right to water and sanitation and acknowledged that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realisation of all human rights. The Resolution calls upon States and international organisations to provide financial resources, help capacity-building and technology transfer to help countries, in particular developing countries, to provide safe, clean, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all.In November 2002, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted General Comment No. 15 on the right to water. Article I.1 states that \"The human right to water is indispensable for leading a life in human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights. Comment No. 15 also defined the right to water as the right of everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable and physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.\"Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza are denied this right every day. The Maia Project (Maia means water in Arabic) is dedicated to bringing clean, safe drinking water to the children of Palestine. Over 90% of the water in Gaza is not potable. The health and well being of virtually every Palestinian child and adult is affected by the shortage of clean, safe water. For those who are unaware, the water crisis in Gaza has been an ongoing issue for decades.Numerous military attacks on the Gaza Strip have devastated Gazas water infrastructure, destroying wells and causing incredibly expensive damage to Gazas water and waste treatment facilities. Additionally, the Siege affects Gazas ability to maintain it\\'s sanitation and water treatment facilities, as no one has access to the necessary building materials and spare pipes and parts.As a result of all these assaults, the water in Gaza is polluted with untreated sewage, agricultural chemicals, and is brackish from seawater. Gazas water contains high levels of nitrates, chloride,fluoride, and other pollutants that cause significant health problems, including parasitic infections, kidney disease, heart disease, damage to the nervous system, cancers, weakened bones and teeth and a life-threatening type of anemia.Clean water is something that many of us take entirely for granted; if you are reading this right now, access to water is most likely not a concern dictating your everyday life. This is a matter of basic human rights, and we hope we can gain your support in making sure that everyone has access to clean water. Thank you for your support!

       "  'Hello and thank you so much for visiting my fundraising site: \"Rod\\'s Challenge For Children\"! One of my favorite quotes is, \"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\". Mahatma Gandhi had this right. This webpage has information about how I plan to use my skills to help build better childhoods for kids who require medical technology to sustain life. Please take a couple of moments to educate yourself about possibly donating to my cause. Please CLICK HERE  to download the flyer and help promote this fundraiser. THE TARGET: I aim to raise $25,000 USD to support The Medically Fragile Children\\'s Foundation of Northern California (MFCFNC). Donations accepted through this website will incur an automatic 5-7% processing fee, which is taken out for administrative costs by this hosting website. Note that 100% of the collected donations will go toward supporting the MFCFNC (field trips to concerts, games, etc; efforts to facilitate family visits; and general connection with childhood experiences). Travel, guide/registration, and fundraising-incidental fees are solely being covered through personal/private funding. THE CHALLENGE:I have enrolled in an expedition on September 14, 2013, called \"The Three Peaks Challenge\" in the United Kingdom (UK). This adventure includes hiking up/down the largest peaks in Scotland, England, and Wales within a 24-hour period (including driving time). Here are the 3 peaks:1) Scotland, Ben Nevis (4409 ft) 2) England, Scafell Pike (3209 ft)3) Wales, Snowdon (3506 ft)In an effort to make this fundraiser more meaningful for potential donors and for the children we serve, I aim to complete this challenge WITH a ventilator (life support) and ventilator battery, totaling 20 lbs (9kg), in addition to the water and supplies I\\'ll already be carrying.   THE STORY:As many of you know, I am very adamant about supporting anything that enhances the well-being of children, especially when it comes to kids with disabilities/special needs. As a former boy scout, camp director, programming director, etc. I have had the privilege, as a camper and staffer/management, of knowing the importance of remaining connected with peers and the community. Camping opportunities (residential/day) hold a special place in my heart, right next to these children who have disabilities that limit their true potential and opportunity to live as happy as a life as they can. Every child, regardless of their situation, deserves the RIGHT to as many \"normal\" childhood experiences as possible.Just in case I have not shared my most wanted goal in life, here it is: To build, from the ground up, the FIRST (there may be a similar program in existence, but am unsure) hospital:camp collaboration in the United States. This would be a on a plot of land, where on one part, a camp would exist. The camp would have loads of adaptations (ramps, adequate power for medical equipment, pools, etc.) to make it as accessible as possible, both in the cabins and in the program areas. Programs would be ran by instructors who share a desire to do something wonderful for these children. On the same property, there would be a small hospital where children have access in case a medical emergency occurs. There would beds reserved for kids that are there on a long term basis and beds for respite care, who come from other hospitals in the state, but would have full access to the outdoors/programs, all within close proximity to medical support. In the summers of 2006 and 2007, I had the privilege of leading efforts to provide day-camp experiences for about 15 children, who resided in hospitals. In 2010, I spearheaded a group of about 12 hospital interdisciplinary team members, comprised of nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists, social workers, PT/OT/SLP\\'s to pave the way for 8 children to spend the night at a camp, AWAY from the hospital. We even worked with an electrician and property manager to modify the cabin\\'s electrical infrastructure to ensure that there was adequate, reliable power to support all of the medical equipment. The children had a blast engaging in programs with their counselors, peers, and nursing staff. Unfortunately, for 2 of these children, it would have been their first and only time to have spent the night outside the walls of a hospital... I have been so blessed to have met and worked with so many wonderful, amazing, inspirational, and talented people in my life. It is those people that have offered to run programs such as adapted surfing, horseback riding, outdoor living skills (setting up a tent), etc. that drive me to want do so something to contribute to humanity. It is my true hope to not only serve these children, but to provide a foundation and conduit for these amazing colleagues of mine to use their talents in a truly meaningful ways.This is where I draw my happiness and motivation in life; service to the community and making better childhoods for kids.THE CAUSE: In 2011, for my 30th birthday, I had the honor and privilege raising funds for The Children\\'s Trust - Tadworth, a charity in the United Kingdom that supports children with medical and special needs. As a result of overwhelming donor support, including Ninja Star Sushi Bar/Restaurant in San Jose, over $3000 USD (2000 GBP) was raised for this absolutely worthy cause.Currently, I serve as President/CEO of the MFCFNC, a non-profit (501(c)(3) (pending)) supporting children who require medically technology to sustain life. It is our purpose to connect these children with as \"normal\" as a childhood as possible. I want to use my involvement with the MFCFNC to help achieve my aforementioned goal of building a camp/hospital collaboration at some point. The MFCFNC\\'s existence revolves around \"Building better childhoods\". This is what we do: MFCFNC Mission Statement:The mission of The Medically Fragile Children\\'s Foundation of Northern \\nCalifornia (MFCFNC) is to serve children (up to 21 years of age), who \\nrequire medical technology and intervention to sustain life, and connect \\nthem with the innate experiences associated with growing up, just as \\ntheir peers without such limitations experience.

I was lying in my bed in a crummy little apartment on the outskirts of the University of Colorado campus in Boulder. It was a quarter to four. If I didn\\'t leave now I would be late to my honors class. 4:00 pm. Class had started. 4:15 pm. I wasn\\'t going. I couldn\\'t move. I was afraid to move. I was afraid that if I got up from bed it wouldn\\'t be to go to the academically rigorous course that I obviously needed to attend, but to do something that would hurt myself in an irrecoverable way. So I lay there, and watched the late afternoon sunlight filter through the window shade and make patterns on the wall.\"For the entire fall semester Id been slipping, sinking into a deep depression that left me unable to care about much of anything, myself included. I quit college in the spring feeling weak, feeling like a failure, and uncertain that I would ever be strong enough to go back. That I would ever be strong again.\"In the midst of trying to put myself back together I went to a Denver Roller Dolls bout at the 1STBANK Center. I felt a lot of things, but the overpowering feeling was awe. Here were women. They cavorted around the track with strength, confidence, and an infectious joy. They were pummeling each other one minute and then dancing unabashedly between jams. And while I understood very little about the actual game, I knew that I wanted to play it.

She had a very aggressive infection in her body that attacked her organs and showed its ugly face on her back. Payton was put on life support as they tried to stabilize her blood presser she was put on 4 different medications to keep her low blood pressure up. They took her to surgery to cut the infection out but it had already attacked her heart and other organs. They were not sure if she would survive the surgery. With lots of prayer she did survive. They cut out many inches of the infection on her back.On Friday they tried to stabilize her and would need to do another surgery to cut the dead skin off but they had to wait. Saturday morning they did the second surgery but this time came good news that the progression of the infection had not spread as much as they anticipated it would. There is damage to her heart which they continue to investigate how much and will be starting dialysis as soon as Payton is strong enough. Her white blood cells are low and that is concerning. They should be high considering the infection. There is a deeper issue the doctors are looking for. She will need white blood cells, bone marrow, a skin graph later on on.

We are taking 8 artists in a van from Vancouver \\nto New Orleans, telling tales of how queer and trans people of color and\\nTwo Spirit love, sex and desire is a force for healing and \\ntransformation. We are spinning life saving, world changing stories that\\npeople remember forever. We are going back to our roots: to where we \\nfirst began, when in 2007 we stuck 7 QTPOC performing artists in a 6-seater \\nminivan and took the Northeast by storm.\\nAnd we could use a little money. For things like \\naccessible hotel rooms and gas. For per diems and airfare and renting \\nvenues.  For making sure we are safe and have enough cash to take us \\nfrom unceded Coast Salish territories, otherwise known as Vancouver, to \\nNew Orleans, city of beautiful \\nresistance.  We\\'re proud that one of our co-directors and half our tour \\nperformers identify as disabled, and making sure we have wheelchair \\naccessible housing and that our venues are accessible comes from both \\nour overall commitment to disability justice and our responsibility to \\nensure that our tour is accessible to our performers. Booking both takes\\nsome cash. To give you a breakdown:$3,000 pays for van rental$1,500 pays for gas for the whole tour\\n$1,200 is the amount of plane tickets we put on a credit card and need to pay off$500 pays per diem for the cast and crew for two days$250 feeds the cast and crew for a day\\n$100 pays a tech person$50 is half of one hotel room$25 feeds one performer for one day$10 is three gallons of gas\\nAnd every single dollar helps.\\nWhy is this so important? Read on.Who we are: The Mangos With Chili story (the short version)8 years, 150 artists, 4 tours,  100+ productions, 2 countries plus \\nAztlan. 44 indigenous territories. One pre-Kickstarter Paypal \\nfundraising campaign when we both literally had $47 in the bank. one \\npre-GPS 125 mile all night roadtrip through the backroads of northern \\nNew Mexico on no gas.

Our goal is to produce high-quality \\nmulti-genre performances reflecting the lives and stories of queer and \\ntrans people of color (QTPOC) and speaking out in resistance to the \\ndaily struggles around silence, isolation, homophobia and violence that \\nQTPOC face.Founded in 2006 by Cherry Galette and Leah \\nLakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, two trailblazing artists with significant \\nperformance experience and honors to their names. Mangos With Chili \\nbegan as an annual touring cabaret of queer and trans people of color \\nperformance artists, with the goal of creating a cultural institution \\nthat would build the careers and visibility of QTPOC artists. Our tours have performed to sold out houses across North America, \\nwowing audiences in world class theaters, underground performance \\nspaces, bars, and campus halls, with high intensity, breathtaking \\nperformance, politics, and storytelling craft, reflecting the lives and \\nstories of queer and trans people of color.  More than a performance incubator, we are also a ritual space for \\nqueer and trans communities of color to come together in love, \\nconversation and transformation. Our goal is to present high quality \\nperformance art by QTPOC, but so much of our work is also about creating\\nhealing and transformative space through performances that are \\ngathering places for QTPOC community.\\nWe\\'ve featured at  Brown  University, (feature for \\nthe Black Lavender Experience Theatre Symposium 2011), Oberlin, \\nSwathmore, Amherst, Smith, American University, Georgetown, \\nU.C.

We\\'ve received \\npositive media coverage from the SF Bay Guardian, the SF Chronicle, The SF Appeal, Bitch, Feminist Review, Hip Mama, Aorta, and Make/Shift magazines,\\nand weeklies and alternative press across North America- and we\\'ve \\ngotten feedback like, \"Mangos with Chili is church\" from our audience \\nmembers.\\nWe started this work in 2006, inspired by second wave queer feminist \\nof color institutions like Kitchen Table Press that had given us life, \\nand had ended. 8 years later, we know so much more than we did about \\nboth what a struggle it is to sustain QTPOC arts institutions, and just \\nhow important it is.\\nThe 2014 Whipped Tour:\\nDuring late January and February 2014, we\\'ll take 8 artists on the road to tour Whipped: QTPOC Recipes for Love, Sex, and Disaster to\\naudiences along the West Coast, Southwest, and Gulf Coast. Mangos\\nWith Chili knows that queer and trans* folks of color \\ndo love, sex and total disaster like none other! In this special \\nValentine\\'s themed production,  queer and trans* folks of color will \\ntell \\ntheir true life stories of love, desire and disaster through music, \\nspoken word, theater, dance, drag, film, and video diaries. Our show \\nwill explore the complexities of love, sex and desire- how they are a \\ncomplicated, rich force for healing and transformation in our \\ncommunities.

       "  \"As most of you know I'm currently in the Navy and stationed just outside Oklahoma City. I have a son that lives in California. It will soon be his birthday (8 Nov) and he will be turning 10 years old. I joined the Navy a year ago and havent had a chance to take leave as of yet. I took some time off of work (before the Navy) to go see my dad back home in Korea. My dad is much older than most of your fathers, as he is 85. He was previously married before he met my mom and they had me. Anyway, some of you may know that my father's health hasn't exactly been the best, so before leaving for bootcamp I had to make the difficult choice of either seeing my father or my son. Being that I had just visited my son a few months prior, my father's health, and not knowing when the Navy would allow me to visit Korea, a foreign country, again. I chose to visit my parents. Needless to say, it's been about a year and a half since I have seen my son. I've never been the type to ask for help. I'm really prideful and don't accept gifts or handouts. My father taught me to always work for what I want and you only deserve what you've earned. My father also taught me to be the first person to help someone in need. Regardless of what it is I've never been shy when it comes to lending a helping hand. Whether it's money that a person needs, someone to talk to, advice, help with moving, just someone to be there for them--honestly, anything.. I'm the type of person to give the shirt off my back to help a friend or even a stranger. My offer to help, will always be open to anyone that knows me. It's one of qualities my father instilled in me as a young child. Lately, I've been struggling myself. Let's face it, I'm only an E-3 in the Navy and the military doesn't pay us very well. I've managed pretty well for myself so far. My father's been in the hospital since March and Tricare only covers up to a certain percentage of his hospital bill because he has to see a specialist at a civilian hospital. It's not really fair that he's in that type of situation when the military hospital is so limited. I help my parents out the best I can, I pay $600 a month in child support to help my son's mother cover bills to raise him. I make sure he's taken care of in all aspects. I've even gone as far as lending friend's money to help them in need. All this is finally catching up to me. Unfortunately, I won't be able to go to California to see my son for his birthday because the Navy won't give me leave until December. Tickets are a bit more expensive during the holiday season as well. I would use any money raised from this fund to help cover my ticket, rental car, and hotel as I stay with my son for the 4 days of leave I get to take. Not only would this be unbelievably appreciated by myself, but it would make my son so incredibly happy. All he ever asks me whenever we FaceTime is when he will be able to see me again. You would make a little boy's world and I will be forever greatful. Let me just say thank you in advance to those that can help and thank you to those that read this yet cannot help as well because I know not everyone has the ability to do so, but your prayers alone would be deeply appreciated. Thank you\"),\n",

       "  'Hello and thank you for taking a minute of your time to look at this page. My name is Tania and I have a small in-home daycare where I have met and been allowed to LOVE all of the children that spend their day with me as their caregiver on a daily basis. In July I received some news that one of my babies had something wrong with his eye and needed to go see a specialist. Of course the first thing I did was PRAY and ask my family and friends to PRAY that everything turned out ok. After the extensive testing was complete the results broke my heart. My little Alex was diagnosed with cancer in his eye and now needs to travel from Fredericksburg VA to the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia every other week for Chemo treatment... 209 miles away! This family has had to change their entire routine in order to get treatment for their baby. Mom can no longer work because she has to be home with Alex and tend to him on good and bad days. Dad is overworked and exhausted to be able to support not only financially but physically to be there every step of the way during these long drives and long sleepless nights. Alex has an older sister Giana and a twin brother Anthony who also have to make these trips in support of their brother. The expenses for this family have become unexplainably difficult to meet which is my reason for starting this fund. I really hope you can find it in your heart to contribute to this fund and help this family out. Every cent counts and is greatly appreciated. Even if you have taken the time to read this page and cannot contribute at this time, please leave a message of support and say a prayer for this family so they know their baby is being prayed for! Thank you in advance for your help and support! We love you Alexander Patton! Keep fighting Buddy!'),\n",

       "  \"My brother-in-law, Greg Duits, has been diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a blood cancer that causes the plasma to become malignant. The cancer cells then accumulate in the bone marrow crowding out the healthy cells and compromising the integrity of the bone. An oncology treatment plan was quickly put into place. Greg is undergoing four rounds of chemo before heading to Ann Arbor for a stem cell transplant. This will include a 2-3 week hospital stay before returning home where he will heal and regain his strength over the course of three months. There is no cure for Multiple Myeloma but the intention of his treatments is to put the cancer into remission. Many people have asked me what they can do for Greg and Tricia. I've created this account just for that purpose. When you have cancer the everyday trials don't just go away. The Duits family needs a new roof on their home. Greg and Tricia will both be missing weeks of work. They will be traveling to appointments in Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor. This means, gasoline, vehicle upkeep, food and hotels. While Greg is fighting, and winning, this battle I don't want them to worry about a leaky roof, money, food or medical bills. I want them to feel a peace about those things. I want them to replace any worries, fears and concerns with love, strength, comfort and faith. Please consider donating any amount that you are able. Thank you for your generosity and kindness.

       "  \"On Saturday October 29, 2016 I had the pleasure of winning the Seekonk Speedway DAV Memorial Late Model feature. It was at that exact moment, I knew I needed to help my long time friend, Leon Hayes by donating all my winnings to help my buddy out. He'll probably be upset with me, but with his recent tragedies, I feel overly compelled to do this. Lee has always given the shirt off his back for anyone he ever met, now it's his turn to accept a helping hand. Here is his story...The Hayes family has taken another hit in the wall of turn 3 in this race track called life. With the recent loss of the families 'crew chief', Kristin Wordell Hayes, Lee, Haley, & Austin are now spinning tires in reverse trying to figure out how to get back into neutral let alone 1st gear.Lee & Kristin were married close to 16 years ago. They were blessed with 2 beautiful children, Haley & Austin. Life was normal for this crew of 4 until Austin was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Multiple surgeries & complications left this perfectly healthy school age child with numerous physical & cognitive deficits. Lee had no choice but to keep working full time in Local 17 sheet metal union & make race bodies on the side to help support his family so that Kristin could stay home & tend to the families needs. Kristin was the crew chief, the tire girl, the spotter, the fuel person, the garage sweeper. She was the dance mom, the house wife, the landscaper, and like many moms, carried the burdens in her heart for those in her family. Tragically on her 35th lap, Kristin left the race unexpectedly. She took the checkered flag and flew to a greater track in the sky. Her last lap was one the family will never forget. Now, her families cars are in track stalled & unable to get re-started. Lee now has to be the owner/driver, crew chief, tire guy, fuel guy, the spotter, the landscaper, & the dance dad, while carrying the hurt & pain of his children & grieve himself. Somewhere in this race, he needs to work to support his family, which has its very own unique set of circumstances. Haley still needs to be a teenager, Austin still needs ongoing attention, & Lee needs to be both the dad & the mom. Please help us support Leon Hayes in his race of life. This family has had enough cautions & red-flag moments interuppting the race. Let's help them get the car back on the track so they can run the next 100 laps on one set of tires. Let's help Lee take some time out of work so he can re-structure, re-organize, & re-do the set up & hopefully re-fire the engines to keep this race going.\"),\n",

Hopefully you guys can take me to Miss PA and then ultimately Miss USA.A little bit of why I am competing;  I know, I know.....being the female empowerment type of chick I am, it sounds hypocritical to be competing in a \"beauty pageant\" but let me bust the myth about pageants! The term beauty pageant has been married to the negative stigma of showcasing and judging physcial attributes based on a woman\\'s body and beauty. But what most people don\\'t see is that yes, although beauty plays a role in the competition, beauty is also judged as a woman\\'s confidence in her own body, mind and soul. At 26, I will be one of the oldest competitors in the pageant, but I\\'ve never felt more sexy, confident, and successful as a woman! I would want nothing more than to share my confidence with other women and inspire/promote young ladies to strive for similar success.Having a background in community nursing and a Master\\'s in Women\\'s Health I naturally chose the promotion of women\\'s health and wellness as my platform. My passion and desire to educate women about their bodies drives me to bring public awareness and education about staying healthy, preventing disease and healing issues using different medical/ non medical methods. My ultimate dream would to become a public health figure and I believe that becoming Miss Pennsylvania is a great start!!! So please help support my cause in competing and furthering my goal of educating women that their happiness, health and success is all in their power.I believe in leading by example and about 2 years ago, after suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis for 10 years, I decided to take charge of my health. I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired! I wanted heal myself physically and mentally so I decided to get active and joined a Crossfit gym, changed my diet and rid my body of awful toxins I call processed foods!!!, began the practice of yoga, and invested my time in learning about other medical practices. I have never been happier and healthier than I currently am, and it all starts with a little motivation. I would love to empower and motivate others to make lifestyle changes.   \" I am here to serve. I am here to inspire. I am here              to love.

Erica is a burn survivor, she was in an accident when she was 5 years old. Dr's gave her a 30% chance to live, they even suggested her parents bring in a priest to give her her final farewell. Through the odds, she fought through over 30 surgeries and is the beautiful, funny, loving, full of life women I fell in love with 4 years ago. Erica has always struggled with her scars and would never leave the house without long sleeves. I remind her everyday that she is beautiful no matter what.This woman has been my rock since day one, I lost my job a year into our relationship and she has held down our home since. She was the bread winner for most of our relationship until recently I finally found another job. Now I'm working my hardest to give Erica her dream wedding and make her feel as beautiful as I know she is. However,I know I can't do this alone.Please help me give my future wife the wedding of her dreams. She has been through so much throughout her life I just want to give her the world.

In preparation for this examination, the pair will be taking a prep course beginning May 2014 and ending right before the exam. This course costs $3200/person.

       "  \"December 1st marked my 5th month with the ministry. Since September, we have been to 9 different states and have done over 30 events. During these events our speaker, Justin Fatica, brings the message of hope and God's love. We focus on the pain and suffering; the one thing we have in common is our pain and our suffering. We invite the youth to see the pain that others are going through and that they are not alone. During the Catholic/Christian events we also have Prayer Ministry, where we pray with the people who need prayer and give them encouragement. Being with this ministry has shown me that sharing my story, no matter how uncomfortable I feel, will always help someone else. Through HAN we will be able to touch 300,000 lives with the Gospel this year. Some might wonder why this is needed, but the reality is, we live in a world where our youth are lost and have forgotten about Gods love and endless mercy for us. So many struggle with issues like depression, physical/sexual abuse, addictions and they feel as though they have nowhere or no one to turn to. They fail to realize, usually because they have not been taught, that God is there with open arms ready to heal us from our past and our failures and make us new. I, myself, struggled with my own issues and had a beautiful encounter with God that began a real conversion in my life. I hope to reach others and let them know God can do even more than what they imagine when they open up their hearts. Our key program is Follow Up, which is done back at the office in Syracuse, NY. Two weeks after an event, we reach out to the kids who signed up for follow up, see how they are doing and walk them through the 8 step program to Win it All. Some of these steps are recognizing your importance, discovering your mission, making your mess a message, among others. In order to be a missionary I have to fundraise minimum $8,000. I have reached half of that goal, I currently have about $4,400 (gofundme deducts a good amount from the donations). Our mean of transportation is by our You're Amazing Tour bus which we drive to every event we go to. The money goes towards gas, food, and travel expenses while on the road and for housing while in Syracuse. I am begging for prayers and monetary donations. Whatever you can give, no matter how small, please do not hesitate. The Lord will bless you in abundance. Hard as Nails is a 501c nonprofit organization, any donation is tax deductible.

We call our Feeding Ministry the \"Breakfast Club\", which is very dear to our hearts, as we have witnessed, and continue to witness the Mighty Hand of God moving on so many levels and in so many areas of the lives of our friends on the street whom we serve, as well as the lives of the 25 or more dedicated members who faithfully serve in the ministry. \\n\\nI don\\'t mean to be lengthy, but I have to share the \"Empty Pot Miracles\" that many of our brothers and sisters have witnessed, I have witnessed this on more than occasion over the years, Praise God. As members, we all serve in some capacity in the Breakfast Club, we wake up at 5 am or earlier, every Sunday morning to serve our friends on the streets. We are blessed to have as many as 35 people who serve on a given Sunday morning... It\\'s a Calling. The \"Empty Pot Miracle takes place as the one serving looks down the line and clearly sees there may be 12 people in line waiting to be served, while the server is looking at an \"empty pot\", but the pot will miraculusly deliver its content until the last person is served. \\n\\nPastor P.B. Townsend, my father who is Head Pastor of the Fountain of Faith, took on the God-Given Responsibility of feeding and clothing our friends on the streets. He was given the Mantle on the Deathbed of the Founder of the Feeding Ministry, brother John Worth, who started feeding people out of the back of his pick up truck at 4 am, riddled with cancer and his 14 year old daughter, out on the streets on the coldest mornings, serving his hungry friends with the best that he had. For 30 years, the Feeding Ministry of the Fountain of Faith Christian Assembly has Never Missed Feeding One Meal. That is the Power of God. \\n\\nThe Lord has sent many faithful servants over the years and I have been very blessed and honored to have taken the helm of the Feed Ministry for the last 10 years. All Glory and Honor goes to the Only True and the Living God that we serve. This could not be what it is without the loving, faithful, and obedient hearts of the ones who sacrifice early every Sunday morning to go out of their way to help their friends.

       "  'Hello!This campaign is to fund assisted care personnel for my parents, Dick and Kathy Sherman, so they can remain together and in their own home. They need assisted care in their home. Here\\'s their story.Dad and Mom have been married for nearly 64 years. When they first married, Dad entered youth ministry when he was 21 (with Youth for Christ in Toledo, OH) and they later moved to the Bay Area (San Jose, CA) where he was the Tri-County YFC director in the late 50s-early 60s. Dad then became a youth minister at The Valley Church in Cupertino, CA, where he stayed until the early 70s, and where he directed the high school and college kids in \"You\\'re A Good Man, Charlie Brown,\" which toured up and down California. He helped start a new church, The West Valley Bible Fellowship, in the early 70s, and he pastored that church until 1985, when it closed its doors. It was at Valley that Dad first heard about Francis Schaeffer, and then at the Fellowship where he wrote the study guides to two of Schaeffer\\'s films (Reclaiming the World and The Great Evangelical Disaster). After the Fellowship, Dad went to work for Orchard Supply Hardware in corporate training, and he stayed with them until he retired in 1997. Throughout this time, Mom was the consummate wife and homemaker, making sure us kids were where we needed to be and on time, cooking meals, keeping the house running smoothly, etc. She was always there for us when we needed her.During all that time, Dad and Mom cared and provided for a growing family (5 children). All the years he was in the ministry, Dad never had any retirement set aside. When he was pastor of the Fellowship, he also ran a landscaping business on the side to make ends meet, especially during the lean times when the Fellowship was out of money. During all those years, we never heard Dad or Mom complain about money or the lack thereof. They just made do with what they had; and we always had food on the table and good clothes for school and church. It was part of their Iowa and Great Depression upbringing that enabled them to take what they had and make it last and make it work.Well, now it\\'s time for us kids to pay them back. Over the last several years, Mom has developed dementia and she is now in need of 24/7 care. Dad can\\'t do it all. He has tried, but it is too much work. He also recently had rotator cuff surgery on his left shoulder, so he will be in recuperation for at least 6 months. My brother Tim and one of my sisters, Melodee, have been tag-team staying with them, caring for them, but they are both worn out also, and they have their own families. We (my siblings--Patty, Melodee, Tim, Becky, and I) need to bring in professional care-givers who can assist with the daily needs of living. Dad and Mom vowed to each other that they would be cared for at home until they repose. Mom, Dad, and I are Orthodox, which means that we know that all that happens to us is for our salvation and benefit. We trust in the Lord and look forward to our going home to Him. Our knowledge and faith, however, don\\'t pay the bills. We must do that. So, I, the youngest of the five kids, am appealing to you to give a little bit so that Mom and Dad, Dick and Kathy Sherman, can remain together in their little home in Scio, OR, and can live in dignity together. Whatever amount you can give will go entirely to their care. I will not take a dime. All funds will be used to pay for professional care-givers to attend to my parents\\' needs. Although I don\\'t think we would ever raise a million dollars, should that happen, any funds in excess of providing the needed assisted-care for my parents would be donated to Alzheimer\\'s research and/or a similar family in need.Thank you, and may God bless you for your almsgiving.'),\n",

       "  \"Hello!!!First, I want to just say thank you for taking the time to read this. My prayer is that God is hand-picking every person, that he desires, to read this. Right now my life consists of working, and preparing for the next season of life.I just graduated high school in January, and I will be working at Hume Lake Christian Camps this summer. I have dreamed about traveling and having new experiences for years, all with hope that I would have the opportunity to be surrounded by an uplifting community. Now, I am able to see that God is granting me the desires of my heart with the intention of knowing him in a deeper way. I have been accepted into YWAM's (Youth With a Mission) discipleship training school in Kona, Hawaii! The program is split into two phases: lecture phase and outreach.LECTURE PHASE:On September 25th I will venture to Kona, Hawaii to spend three months dedicating my heart and time to knowing God deeper. For those three months, I will become equipped to love the community I am surrounded with by understanding who they are. The focus for this time is to see God move and transform each of our lives by fixating our thoughts and desires on him and growing a deeper understanding of who he is. In order to expand this understanding, we will attend classes daily, where we will dive into the Bible, listen to various speakers, and engage in worship through singing and prayer. We will learn what it means to abide in him and how to be a transformed community. As we begin to seek him, our purpose will be focused on reaching the broken, the lost, the weary, and the lonely. I believe that the simplicity of the gospel has the power to change lives and bring life to where only death remains. This training will equip us to bring relief where there is a need.OUTREACH:The locations for the outreach will be chosen within the first few weeks of the lecture phase. Some examples as to where I could be going are South Africa, Cambodia, the Middle East, Fiji, Spain, or Ireland. In each place the need is different. As a team, our hearts are set on knowing God and making him known. God has given me a heart for the broken. I am looking forward to allowing him to let me act as His hands and feet as he does healing. This is a season of him leading me into a ministry where His heart is at the center. There are far more unknowns than knowns, and because of that I am looking forward to see God show up through my lack of expectations.I know that more than anything, he has designed my life to be done with a body of people. You are that body. I have no faith that I can do any journey alone. The desire of my heart is that you would be willing toplay the role of a hand or a foot or an ear as God wants to use you in this journey too.Ultimately I ask that you will partner with me in prayer. If you feel lead to give financially, I just want to say thank you in advance, and if you are unable to, please join my team by sharing my story with your friends and family.Thank you!!-Reigha***This is Revival  the turning of our hearts to God, with a desire to glorify him with all of our lives.***\"),\n",

Our interconnectedness is a fact. How we utilize that is up to us. I believe that \"God\\'s Work in Progress\" (tm) has been called by God to build a network. How about 10 million Christ Followers, going to work every day, in business, government, and education, impacting their work, what they do, and how well they do it.?. Imagine them helping people to grow and thrive and flourish, and ....TO KNOW JESUS by giving to their co-workers and followers in this way:A demonstration that is an invitation. What if these millions introduced Jesus through their work and in relationship at work where they see these people every day?This type of netwwork would be a critical mass that would transform the marketplace in America, and from there, te world.How Do We Achieve This?To achieve this goal we need to build another type of network. A Radio Network. We want to distribute our program to the top 50 population centers in the U.S. on the best Christian Radio Stations in those markets. If you and I accomplish this, we can reach a potential 150,000,000 listeners and find 10 million Christians, among them who can impact the rest. A doable, necessary goal if we truly want Christ to be truly relevant. True networking is the key. Gods Work in Progress will link people together to bring love, real effectiveness and improvement, and God knows we need those. God wants a marketplace that is full and satisfying to Him and us. It is the redemption of the system, to make ALL things new. To equip, to train, to motivate, to inspire, and to love people in the place where the majority of their waking life is spent. Indeed, Jesus said we would do greater works, and this is a greater work. He prayed for unity in his last hours, before he was crucified. And now he is revealing that WORK is a unifier. We all work, it is one of the MAIN activities we have in common. We are all created to work. Will you help us now? This is a big goal and will take BIG resources. To help us to help the Church in its calling to save the world, we can do our part by saving the Marketplace. The Church, you and I, being light and salt, can reveal Jesus to a fallen world. Each $10,000 we raise equals a new station in the network. Friends, at this year-end I pray that God is already bringing the people he has prepared in advance to fund our growth (Eph 2:10) But even now, as a fledgling ministry, only 18 months old, we are in serious need of financing in the short term.

If you dont know what YWAM stands for or means, it stands for Youth With A Mission. YWAM trains students for three months and then sends them out on an outreach in another country, for three more months. DTS stands for Discipleship Training School. I will be training in Heidebeek, The Netherlands for the first three months.    While at the DTS I will be learning more of whom God is and growing closer in my own relationship with Him. I will also learn how to share the Gospel through mission work and evangelism. After the lecture phase (DTS; first three months) YWAM will send all the students out into smaller groups to another location, which is still unknown. This phase is called the outreach phase and is for three months. The three months of outreach will be lots of traveling, evangelizing, giving aid to those in need, and helping not only their physical needs but more importantly their spiritual needs.    During these six months overseas, I will experience incredible opportunities and my life will be forever changed! Im getting excited, yet scared as the time draws nearer. I know that this is what God had planned for me even before I knew what YWAM was. God has put missions on my heart and to help His people. Through this trip I can better learn how to do what He called us all to do, Go and make disciples. I also chose the Mercy and Justice DTS because my heart hurts for people that have been put in unjust situations and for those that never got a fair chance. I want to bless others through my blessings.    I hope that you see what God is doing in my life. I am so thankful to the people in my life who have helped me grow as a person and as a child of God.

Described by veterans in one word, \"burly\", roughly 10 people attempt and complete this route every year.

I hope to capture rare footage of these beautiful mountains and create a documentary to share with the world. The goal is to climb as many peaks as is reasonable, sharing rare vantage points from some of the most beautiful locations on the planet. AND --------------------------------2) Pilgrimage to India to become a yoga teacher: October - December, 2013The plan is to live at an Ashram as a humble yogi, going deeper than ever before into my own practice, so that I can return and help others on the path towards healing, balance, connection, grounding, and radiating love. I hope to document what I discover on this journey, as I travel both outwardly, and deep within. I hope to also show how people live on the other side of the world in order to increase awareness, compassion, and loving kindness between all humans on this planet.--------------------------------For both legs of the journey, I want to share the experiences - with loved ones, friends, fellow dreamers and wanderers, and supporters - through pictures, video updates, Internet blogging, postcards, and any other form of media that helps deliver the message, the story, the epic adventure.

Anna\\'s father will not allow her to fly as an unaccompanied minor, so I am faced with either paying for 3 round-trip tickets from Seattle to Orlando (to fly myself there, pick her up, and then bring her back and fly myself home afterward) - or the option of not seeing my daughter at all for the rest of the year. I am still obligated to pay child support to my ex-husband, even when she is with me for those 6 weeks of the year - and my ex-husband is not obligated to share the cost of her travel expenses for visitation.Every year, I look forward to seeing my daughter in the summertime. Legally, I am allowed more visitation time with her (such as spring/winter breaks and Christmas) but haven\\'t had the means, financially, to see her for every occasion I have rights to. I made a choice not to have more children because I am already struggling to support my family with my singular income.Here in Seattle, Anna would be surrounded by family and friends that she hasn\\'t gotten to visit with since last year. This time is very precious for a young girl, and it would absolutely be a dream come true for her Mom.I have 21 days from today to make this happen, and to make my visitation rights into a reality of actual visitation. Anything helps! The \"Reward Levels\" are required for this style of All-Or-Nothing fundraising on GoFundMe, but I want you to know that I will reward every single one of your donations with my deepest gratitude, a \"thank you\" note, and time to spend with both of us when Anna has arrived (you must be local to Seattle, of course).NEW REWARD LEVELS ADDED! - Portrait Sketch by Jessep Bangham!\"For those who can contribute, you are amazing people and I will personally sketch out a portrait for anyone who contributes $100 or more.\"Please provide your physical mailing address and any requests for the image (captions, etc).\" I will confirm the pledges with Jessep directly.To protect the supporters, I am not able to change the existing reward levels after the fundraiser go-live, so I have set this new reward level at $101.00.If you donate $100, 101, or more, I will make sure you get BOTH rewards (Video and Sketch)!!- Pre-Inked Ultimark address stamp, donated by Ben Morhaime!If you can contribute $45, Ben Morhaime has donated 2 address stamps, which can be personalized with your address (or any address, really)! Thank you, Ben!!- Hand-picked music mix (CD) from Anna! \\nDid you know that Anna LOVES music, and I love making playlists with her? She takes it home with her at the end of our summer visit on a CD (or few).\\nIf you choose the Music Mix level at $30, we will make a customized CD mix JUST FOR YOU!'),\n",

       "  \"My name is Fernando Vzquez. As a volunteer climbing instructor for the non-profit Catalyst Sports, I strive to make adaptive climbing more accessible to people with different types of disabilities. This is one of my climbing partners, William Lowery. Even though he's blind, he has never let that disability stop him from reaching his goals. Last July, armed with incredible will power, William beat every expectation we had by getting second place in the visually impaired category on the first USA Paraclimbing Nationals, and qualified for the World Paraclimbing Championships on September 8-14th, in Gijon, Spain. His family humbled me by asking me to be his eyes yet again in the coming competition, as they believe I am an important part in his success.Though I am incredibly honored, this had not been my plan. The trip is not currently within my means, and I have little more than a week to try to find the money... Which is why I'm asking for your help. William's family was able to find me a ticket for $500. As a man of principle, I believe it would be unfair for me to raise funds for a trip for myself, while the real athlete has to cover his own costs. That is why I'm setting this fundraising effort. William's plane expenses are just over $1000; lodging, transportation, and accommodations for both would quickly ammount to nearly $2500.Help us conquer this daunting mountain. Help me be his eyes on the wall once again. Please give generously. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart.I've been blessed with incredibly supportive friends and family and I'm certain that with a small push we can get all the expenses covered for us. But why stop there? Any excess donations will be transfered to Catalyst Sports and used to expand adaptive climbing programs making them more accessible to people in the South East and all over the US.If you have no money to spare right now, but still believein this vision, please visit their page and support them in any way you can, whenever you can. ( http://www.gocatalystsports.org)UPDATE: Thanks to the support of so many amazing friends, the initial goal was met! I've just increased my goal to $3000, and I hope the momentum keeps going! Thank you so much to everyone that helped me reach the $2000 milestone. I want to encourage everyone to keep supporting us, as it would be even more awesome to get as much as we can for lodging, transportation, and food, plus any extra we can get to support Catalyst.

Throughout my life I have faced many trials, self-doubt and have fought against many odds but still have been blessed with so much knowledge, courage and talent to create projects and opportunities in arenas I only dreamed I'd be in.  I have worked with some of the most recognized facesin the industry, marketed products seen and used daily in homes across the world, and strengthened my work ethic to its highest level.Thank you to all who continue to call, text, email and encourage me while I continue to press through the completion of my first book. I have finished my first round of edits and now diving into my second round of revisions. Over the past few months I have seen tremendous growth in not only myself but also my support circle around me. It continues to inspire me and add to a story, which is my own. The people and experiences I continue to encounter are always beyond my imagination and Im excited for the day I can send a message telling everyone it is complete. Israel was amazing; it forced me to get out of my comfort zone and allowed me to see through eyes and document experiences I never thought were possible. With that said I will be traveling to India not only for inspiration but to serve others and hear stories of women who have been through enormous amount of adversity. Here is a little about my trip below along with the revised version of the first chapter of my book. About 2.2% of Indias population are Christian. With over 2000 unreached people groups, there are 1.2 billion people living with out Jesus Christ. In early November I will have the chance to travel to the heart of India, the Madhya Pradesh province, to provide Christian teaching to women and children in the region. In partnership with Mid India Christian Mission and The Crossing Church a team of 14 of us will be sharing Jesus with Christian women who lead ministry in their local churches. In addition, we will also work with Mercy Home for Girls, a Christian home for orphaned or abandoned girls, and Oasis of Love, and a ministry for handicapped adults and children. You can learn more about Mid India Christian Mission at their website:  www.midindia.com The REACH India trip is an amazing opportunity to invest in the women of India. As we facilitate a womens conference, and visit various mission projects, I am looking forward to building relationships and learning from the people of India. I am incredibly humbled by this opportunity and anticipate a significant shift in my understanding of Gods love and the hardships of life in another country. In order to seize this remarkable opportunity, I need your support. First and foremost, I need friends and family to pray for our team. The prayer support of friends and family is just as important as the ones who go on the trip. Would you please commit to pray for our team as well as me personally? You can specifically pray for our team to have the strength, especially emotionally and spiritually so that we can be witnesses of Gods love for the women of India. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and for considering how you can also be part of changing the life of women in India. I look forward to sharing with you all that we were able to do to help empower life transformation in the lives of women and families. ******REVISED ***** So that you can preview a piece of my work, I have included an excerpt from the book as well as a link explaining my passion for this project and the convictions to which I hold my life's standards. CHAPTER 1 SHE ISBORN I wonder about that term freedom of choice. When does this statement actually apply to the reality we live? I assume society would say at the age of 18, but what about all of the things we arent allowed to choose prior? We get to choosewait, no, we are born into our living environments here on Earth. The entire process: our parents, our siblings, even the socio-economic status we would encounter all decided, for us, by God. We simply get to come to the home prepared for us, to the blankets and gifts made for us, and the clothing chosen for us. It seems peculiar to me that choice is so loosely characterized as the gift given to mankind, however, it so often comes misguided and unwanted. Aside from material possessions, before we were born, our parents chose certain emotional things for us. Things like bitterness, un-forgiveness, pain and economic struggle come to us free of charge, but at the same time are heavily priced if we ever decide to depart with them. Is it fair for children to develop these predetermined scars because of the environment they had absolutely no choice to be in? Or are the aforementioned concerns disregarded because at the age of 18 the child will be forced to deal take responsibility for it all? When you are born you become an individually new entity to members of your familys life. On the other hand, as a child your family now encompasses all you know about life. These people feed, clothe, bathe, communicate and love you, if one of those elements ever go missing is it fair to assume that the childs decision-making skills are mature enough to choose properly. Bringing me again to the question Does a child really have a choice? If the answer is no, then when is it right time to say the child is eligible to choose on its own? Confused yet? Good, well, this is the heart and breath for which I write this book. If you have picked up this book then its safe to say that youve made a choice, which leads me to believe that you are competent enough to make your own choices. Knowingly or unknowingly, the choice you have made by picking up this book was the choice to venture into the world of self-actualization. Thereby, relinquishing the responsibility from your mother, father or an Ex who you may feel have left you disadvantaged in this world. You are choosing, by completing this book, to walk away from the pain, forgive the past, and move forward- embracing the warmth of the unrestricted, you. To the men reading this book: I want you to know that women are not the enemy, though at times I know it can feel that way. Throughout this book, my plan is to express the enemy women continuously fight within. Enemies that make it difficult to be what you need us to be, which in turn result in the reality that if we are in this state of mind while dating you, then, you too arent capable of being what we need you to be. By the end of this reading its my hope that we, together, can grown into whole individuals willing, but more importantly, able to love one another. I pray you stay along with me for the journey. To the women reading this book: The choice you make by continuing to read this book is the choice to begin looking intrinsically for your truth. You are now the person free to make her own decisions, the person no longer allowed to blame your pre-existing conditions on the outcome of her life because your voice is now unlocked through the words from which I liberate you. The choice you have made is to take your story and illustrate the importance of becoming your own biggest fan. Dont get for a moment get it twisted into thinking that for some reason I cannot relate to your story for I, too, understand the struggle of being living with labels, wading through life heartbroken, and faced with the heavy burden of trying to put the pieces back together. Inasmuch, sweet girl, Ive come to learn that we simply cannot continue harboring the pain of the past and creating illusions of why we arent able to be what and who God created us to be. Its time we grow from here. I pray you continue on your journey to freedom because she has a story, she has a message she has scars that shes overcome because she made a choice. She IsYou. Romans 9:11: - For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth; PRAYER Father God I ask that you create in her a clean slate and that she is no longer bound by the scars of her past. I ask that you make her new, even whole, once again. When you brought her into this world you knew all she would bare. I ask that her wrongs are forgiven for she may not have known, but God today she is responsible and has taken the steps to correct her walk and for this she is born again. With a true repentant heart, Lord please lead her on. In Jesus NameAmen. All monies donated will go toward marketing, editing, trip and publishing of the book.Finally, I would like to thank you again for taking the time to even consider supporting my project. If you are receiving this message then you have impacted my life in some form. I would like to offer to the first 10 supporters for your gracious donation a signed copy of the first release when published.

I am seeking $1300 which is the remaining amount needed to pay for the retreat.I've already paid for the deposit and have applied for a $600 grant to help cover travel and film and film processing costs for the project I will be shooting over the course of five days.The project will explore how Afro-Latinx Oaxacan women have preserved their African heritage through food and Yoruba medicine practices and I will be learning from one of my favorite photographers how to harness documentary and reportage to tell food stories revolving around culture.As you know I am a freelancer and on a tight budget but opportunities like this don't come often so any support I receive to help fund this retreat would mean the absolute world to me.

At the young age of 26 an autoimmune disease destoyed his kidneys and he started dialysis. He did his treatments faithfully for years until he got the gift of a donation from one of his sisters at 30. The surgery was rough on Joe and they knew that the kidney wouldn't last a lifetime. He got five years out of that wonderful gift. Not a day goes by that he's not thankful for it.So he began his treatments of three times a week in a center full of other patients while working full time. I met Joe in 2009 and watched him literally fight for his life day in and day out. Enduring hospital trips, infections, access problems, you name it, he's done it. I call him Superman. He's earned the name. Fifteen years on dialysis earns anyone superhero status. In November of 2012 we were trained on doing home hemo dialysis. We had to learn how to work together in a whole new way. Team Wear was born. :)We have our own machine (nicknamed R2) and all the supplies we need to take care of dialysis at home. We do treatment six days a week for an average of four hours an evening. Joe is much healthier and happier being home and being able to have more frequent dialysis. An added benefit of our machine is that it's portable. *it weighs around 75 pounds and we can fly with it as well.So, here is my plan:We are flying from Ohio to San Francisco for our first real vacation together.

       "  \"LISTEN TO THE SONG HAPPY HERE A SONG...Several years ago a director came to me and asked me to write a song for a movie he was making. The movie was about one night in the lives of one family who uncover a lifelong secret, and the toll this secret takes on the family. The movie is inspired bytrue stories of people surviving trauma. The key word here is survival, because in the end, it's not about our experiences, but what we do with them.  This was the impetus for the song HAPPY, written by the incredible songwriter Patrick Kelly and myself featured in Michael Wechslers movie Altered Minds starring Judd Hirsch and C.S. Lee.LISTEN TO THE SONG HAPPY HERE A NOM... So many people write incredible music that becomes the soundtrack to big and small moments in all our lives. It was phenomenal to have HAPPY as the title track of a film. Waking to find the song a contender for an Academy Award nomination.That said, the song does not have the PR machine behind it most of the contenders do to vie for a nomination. But maybe we have something else. Passion has got us this far, now we need help to take the final step. We are creating this campaign to give our song a chance. To get it some marketing and PR help. The challenge is crazy. We have two weeks to campaign for this nomination. Announcements are January 8th. Still we are going for it. The plan - to do all we can before then to let the world know, that underdogs can fly.A PLAN... To get to the nomination, we need marketing funding. We have two weeks to raise $10,000. This is the cost for one ad for a week online in a Hollywood trade paper. Because we have no PR or industry machine behind us, this is the one shot to get word out to the folks that vote, about our little song that could. Crazy right? But also amazing, as is this whole adventure.A DEADLINE....The voting for the final nominations for Best Original Song is happening right now until Januray 8th! There are 74 Official Contenders, and they will choose 5. If you beleive in this song, please consider supporting us. Thank you and here's to the dreamer and underdog in all of us.

This crowd-sourced-fund-raising venture represents a really exciting time for me as a harmoncia player and artist.  It has been over 20 years since i produced my last harmonica record (Mouth Organ Minstrel). As the years have rolled on by, it has always been my dream to produce a double album with one CD devoted to Celtic & American Stringband Music and a companion CD with Blues and Solo Harp Styles. A smorgasbord of music, from dance tunes, to ballads, blues and beyond. The canon of Harmonica Americana is rich and deep and i have spent much of my career passionately minning these treasures.Now it is time to share these lost old gems with the world via a double CD titled: Harmonica Americana. I plan to enlist the best musicians in Milwaukee to support this effort which we'll record at the legendary Surround Sound Studiosand begin recording in late June with a target release date of late summer.

Jason proudly served in the United States Marine Corp and retired after 20 years as a Gunnery Sergeant. He continued to live in Massachusetts continuing and completing his education in HVAC. He loved his family and friends, his fellow Marines, his bands, and of course his music. Jason suddenly passed with no suffering or pain naturally finding out the cause was coronary artery disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, meaning a sudden heart attack.

       "  \"So, where to begin. I'm sure most of you reading this have been sent here by a friend and already know about this, if not I will provide yousome insight on th situation. Errick Easterday is a local photographer. His selflessness has allowed him to attend local, and national shows and festivals in which he stands on stage, running back and forth dodging fans just to get pictures for bands. Mostof the time these bands don't offer to pay him, but use his images for merchandise, social media, and press related items to gain exposure for their band. Errick has never once asked for money to do any of this, he does this because he loves music and capturing the moments involved. This being said, taking pictures for bands is not just a hobby for Errick, this is a career. The equipment he uses to take these pictures cost the same amount as the bands gear on the stage. The lifetyle isn't very profitable while you're trying to gain clientele, along with establishing a name for yourself. But, in the past 4 years, Errick has made a name for himself in the quality and professionalism of his pictures. Aside from being taken on a few tours with Foreveratlast to document their moments of the rock n roll dream, he hasn't made any money to further his career and dream. With this being said, the money you donate on this campaign will be funded to help Errick with the following;1) A reliable vehicle in the price range of $2,500-$3,000.2) License and registration fees.3) Insurance.4) Upgrading his photography equipment.We hope that every band that has used and or posted one of his images to donate. If you can't afford to donate, we ask you please share this campaign to help us reach our goal.Also, it will be great for Errick to stop asking for a ride to every show just to take pictures.\"),\n",

It\\'s my favorite thing in the whole wide world, but... I thought that part of my life was done (I\\'d convinced myself that my acting career was the price I had to pay to transition, so I paid it). To fill that void I\\'ve been busy making other things like websites and photos and videos and just generally learning how to live and be creative in a small town in the Midwest and that all worked too. But...At the beginning of 2016 I was offered anArtist-in-Residency at The Refugehere in Appleton because I\\'ve been actively trying to figure out what my \"next\" was going to be.I thought it was going to be music but no, acting.Boom. I\\'m in a film.And now, I have a window of opportunity to re-invent my life in a very unexpected way... and I need to relocate to Los Angeles in Januarybecause thats where all of this happens. And I need some help to make that happen.(I\\'m not moving... I\\'m just makingroom for a bigger life)The Deal:I need about 10k to make 3 months in LA happen. I need to be there.The Refuge Artist-In-Residence Fund has given me a $5,000 matching grant.Which, because The Refuge is awesome, means every dollar you give is matched by them so hopefully at the end it means 10K.The plan is simple: take advantage of this opportunity and be a working artist again.$5,000 is my goal.If you\\'d like to get something in return for your cold, hard cash - which I totally get -then I can make pictures of you and yours. Really nice ones, too. I can make Headshots which are just useful as hell or, I can make Portraits which are, in my not so humble opinion, genuinely beautiful and basically my favorite things I\\'ve ever made outside of performance.Or, if you want to go nuts because you have this super cool idea... I\\'ll shoot it (if possible). Making pictures is one of my favorite things.Also, the holidays are upon us and older folks (I know a couple) like getting framed photos as presents. I\\'m not saying I\\'m gonna frame a photo of you for grandma, but I\\'m not saying I wont.Other than that... um, the satisfaction in being an advocate for me?But yeah, that\\'s it:I\\'m heading west to roll the dice (with a sensible plan and set of expectations because I\\'m almost a grown-up) and I need your help.Acting is the thing I\\'m supposed to do. I think it\\'s the thing I\\'m best at. And I know that I\\'m the most alive when acting is part of my day and now, because of this film and this, um, interesting world we live in...I have a chance. A shot.*:)The Backstory---New Years Day, 2016 A few hours after delivering a very large order of Kentucky Fried Chicken to an obviously hungover collection of bands and their loved ones (it was this lovely, communal gathering of likeminded, slightly-hungover souls ready to put on a show for each other... after a night of doing shows for other people), Cory Chisel offered me an Artist-in-Residency slot at The Refuge.**Thismeant that I would get a room. Of my own. At this former monastery where creative people were already making things. To realize a long-held dream of writing an albums worth of songs.I didn\\'t tell very many people about it.It was like this private place to explore the idea re-orienting my life to where I thought of myself as an artist first, and whatever my day job was second.It became this placeto dream again and to start exploring the idea of what my next was actually going to be. So I did. I showed up after a days work (with a side-trip to home to feed the cats) more often than not from March to July.And I started to make song-like things which were turning into an album and I thought that was going to be my next.(It\\'s still happening: \"Others\" - a collaborative album out in 2017 - Refuge produced-and-born. Holla!)Oh man, I loved that room and then the genie-in-the-bottle that is my acting career made a dash for escape and won.I got a leading role in an indie film.Aworld of opportunity I had thought long-gone all of a sudden opened up to me: I could act again! The world had grown up a lot while I\\'d been away and now transfolk are taking active action in being involved with the telling of our stories andI want to be a part of that.I can be a part of that.When I moved to Appleton I really tried to NOT talk about my acting career. It was both too complicated (you could see people go, \"Why did this lady play Henry V?\") and it was too hard to think about.It took something like becoming an Artist-in-Residence at The Refuge and the creative energy that is growing therethatme aware of the possibilities I had. The idea that I could be an artist first and foremost in my life rather than a hobby.And so I auditioned for a film almost as a lark, got the role, and changed the trajectory of my life.Now Im ready to take the next step.Thank god for KFC. ;)- End History (for now...)*Of course I went there. I also have no intention of wasting mine.**I cannot overstate how important The Refuge has been to me this year. That initial vote of confidence is foundational to my story.'),\n",

I have been a dedicated dancer since I was four years old, and continue to work hard and train six days a week in order to achieve my dreams. I recently auditioned for the Alonzo King Lines Ballet summer intensive and am so proud to announce that I was accepted! This four week program in San Francisco runs from June 11th to July 8th. It will be my first summer intensive away from home, so I am asking for help with tuition, travel and other expenses. Anything raised past my goal will still be applied to AKLB, and the rest will be saved and put towards tuition and expenses for the other dance programs/workshops I am attending later this summer at Bodyvox and next summer (location to be determined).I am currently dancing for Bodyvoxs youth program, Junior Artist Generator (also known as JAG), and at daVinci Arts Middle School where my arts focus is dance.Before I came to daVinci, I was studying classical ballet at the School of Oregon Ballet Theatre. SOBT is the official training ground for Oregon Ballet Theatre, and offers chances to perform in productions with professional dancers. That is where I began my dance training and I studied there for nine years.The summer intensive at Alonzo King Lines Ballet is a diverse program that supports thegrowth of the contemporary ballet dancer, and valuesartistic risk-taking and independent thinking. I want tostep out of my comfort zone and explore new things that will challenge me, educate me, and help me expand my dancing tool belt. I really believe that the summer program at Alonzo King Lines Ballet could help me achieve this. Other goals of mine that I think the program can help me accomplish are to push myself, to take risks, and to be more independent as a dancer as well as a teenager. I want to explore, boost my creativity, and expand my dance education overall. I also hope to audition this year for the nationally known Jefferson Dance Program at Portlands Jefferson High School. I know that a lot of the dancers there have participated in programs at Alonzo King Lines, and I hope to add my name to that list. It would be a huge honor!The summer intensive at Alonzo King Lines is fairly expensive. Tuition, travel to and from San Francisco, and other expenses really add up. Just the tuition plus room and board is over $5000, and this does not include travel, supplies, or any other expenses. I was lucky enough to recieve partial help through a merit scholarship and a need based scholarship, but am still seeking help for the rest of the expenses through your donations.

Discriminates against single parents, two income families and families with special needs children by forcing them into homeschool. This bill violates every parents constitutional, civil, religious, human and parental rights to decide what is best medical and educational choice for their individual child(ren).SB792 seeks to mandate full CDC adult vaccines as a condition of employment for all daycare workers, preschool teachers working in daycare centers or family home daycares and seeks criminal penalties for non-compliance.AB1117 seeks to increase vaccination rates of Medi-Cal recipient children under two years of age by creating a special fund California Childhood Immunization Quality Improvement Fund (CCIQIF) it targets low-income recipients of Medi-Cal and is discriminatory.We are sovereign human beings, the government does not own our bodies. We do NOT consent to our Government mandating forced medical procedures with known risks to inject our children with any vaccines it deems necessary--ourbodies are NOT public domain!Vaccine adverse reactions are real as many parentshave already experienced with ourselves and/or our children. We want safe and ethical vaccines with the choice to fully vaccinate, partial vaccinate, delay vaccinate, or never vaccinate. Forced vaccine mandates are not the answer to the recent 2014 CA Disneyland measles outbreak. A healthy immune system is what saves lives against disease--vaccine preventable or not!The US govt has paid out 3+ Billion to date for serious adverse reactions. The US supreme court has ruled that vaccines are \"unavoidably unsafe\" and given vaccine manufacturers and medical practitioners full immunity from any harm that may result from the vaccines. If there is a medical risk, there must be a choice!Please support all California parents ability to decide if vaccines are right for their families.

The trail is now at a point where we can consider it complete and ready to ride! Succeeding in this project opens the door for more access. - Weve been awarded an IMBA Trail Care Crew visit for early fall; more details to come.- Lots of work completed in Sterling Forest with the NY NJ Trail Conference this summer. We're getting close to a 4 mile point-to-point trail being complete.- Several other proposals are in the works!We have basically been funding this effort out of pocket and with some help from our closest friends. It is now time to raise some funds so that we can continue our advocacy work in Rockland, Bergen & Orange Counties. Our goal of $8500 will be used to pay for some of our 2015 costs and cover the following expenses:IMBA Chapter membership for 2016:Membership has given us access to the legal, political and organizational advice weve needed in preparing our proposals. Annual Chapter membership is $500 and worth every penny.Insurance coverage for 2016:Not very exciting, but necessary to play ball. Annual Insurance is $1100.Proposals to state, county & town agencies:We have presented our proposals using professionally produced binders and sign boards. A typical Proposal is about $200.Chainsaw Safety Training:6 of us took a 16 hour course to become certified for power tool use in the State Parks. The course cost $1200.Trail building tools & supplies:We've been getting by with help from individuals and our friends at JORBA, but it's time to make some purchases of our own. These tools will be used by the club to build, repair & maintain sustainable singletrack in our area. We have received a generous donation (valued at $1500) of premium custom made pint glasses to be used as thank you gifts.

She loves horses, books and getting letters in the mail. Lorelai is also one of the strongest little girls, even though her bones are just the opposite. Lorelai has osteogenesis Imperfecta aka brittle bones. Her life is often unpredictable. Her bones could break just from the pressure of her standing up or the force of vomiting while she has the flu. Each break is different, different limitations and different pain. She has pain that is not even caused by the breaks at times, just bone pain. Lorelai has a wheelchair that she uses and is growing out of. Recently they went to see her special needs doctor to start the process to get a new wheelchair. One of conditions of her wheelchair being approved is her using it in the house. She will have to use her chair in the house as well as during her everyday life. Lorelai is almost 90 pounds, carrying her in and out of the house is very hard on her parents; therefore a wheelchair ramp is needed. The Burkes have applied for funds from the state and to everyones surprise, including the doctors, they have been denied twice. Her parents have tried several different approaches, grants, groups, etc. With each denial, their hopes have slowly been depleted.Over the past couple of months, we have been working with Home Depot in Sheboygan to work with their vendors to get us a plan and materials, at cost, to build the ramp. In addition, when we had builders out doing the measurements and figuring out a way to do the ramp, the driveway space came up. With how the ramp will go, this cuts into the driveway space. If the family leaves it as is, its a tight fit to get the van into the drive way and be able to get out and such. The funds that are raised will go for these materials as well, along with any permits needed for the projects. This is not a matter of a cosmetic enhancement to the house, but a daily functionality of this childs life. We would love to give this gift to them with your help!Thank you'),\n",

Actors that gave a darn and believed in their parts. (Limited) crew that believed in the script and what it could become. And of course, followers to help spread the word about this project. We seem to have succeeded on all fronts thus far. We were lucky enough to have a plethora of cast members that went above and beyond, a small crew that knew what they wanted and how to get it and tons of followers (Unsounders) on Facebook and You Tube that have helped spread the word.\\n\\nNow, the time has come to get this film out there for the masses to finally see. And it\\'s the last step of the way where we need all the help we can get. The goal here is very simple: raise some money so we can send this movie out to as many festivals that will have us. The only way to get known is to get seen. And the only way to get seen is to show the movie off.In theory, if everyone that clicked Like on Unsound\\'s Facebook page donated 1-2 dollars, we would have more than enough money to submit to a great amount of festivals and cover all the submittion costs and all that comes with it. Every penny will be used for this purpose. I know times are tough, money is tighter than ever -- and asking anybody for a handout takes a lot of nerve. But we should remember that the medium of film is only successful because of moviegoers and fans.

I\\'m very excited for such a tremendous opportunity, and I greatly appreciate your support and encouragement!The play chosen for presentation is \"Food for the Gods\" I wrote and directed this play as my thesis production at Sarah Lawrence College. It was a bold undertaking about HUMAN VALUE that confronted the difficult topic of Black Men and Police Violence in a very experimental way. Written not to incite anger, but to expose beauty, create relatability, and to cause CARE. It included a dinner table of puppets, audience participation, and a moving set. I am so grateful that the work was well received and turned out to be great success. Thus far, the play has beenawarded the Stanely and Evelyn Lipkin Prize for Playwriting. The topic has continued to be one of great concern that has now garnered international attention. For the past 2 years, I\\'ve worked to get the play remounted to a LOCAL NYC audience... but the efforts seemed to be without success; I have had a difficult time finding a space in New York willing to take a chance on remounting a work with such an experimental design .

       "  \"Jayla Amel Morrison was born on June 11, 2009. I had no idea these first five years would be as challenging as they have been. Jayla came into the world at just 4lbs 3oz. Beautiful but frail, she was immediately placed in the NICU, primarily because of a need for oxygen. While in the NICU, the doctors and nurses discovered several new areas of concern; Jayla was not eating well, and failed more than a couple newborn hearing screenings. Jayla remained in the NICU for seven long weeks. I just remember test after test with the doctors trying to figure out what was going on with our sweet girl.It was a local neurologist who saw Jayla during those NICU days that ordered an important test that would eventually help in figuring out this puzzle. Because her eating on her own never improved, her first of several surgeries was the placement of a feeding tube. Upon release from the NICU, Jayla was referred to Childrens Hospital in Denver, CO. At this point, she still had not received a diagnosis. At three months old, the results from the tests our neurologist ordered were instrumental in a diagnosis of Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorder (PBD). We really didnt receive much information during that first meeting at Childrens Hospital; the only thing I really remember was the doctor saying the majority of the babies diagnosed with this disorder only live a year or two and that there was no real treatment. Of course, we were devastated but have adjusted to this new normal. Today, Jayla has surpassed all that was expected of her. Jayla is legally deaf blind and has been going to Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind for the past 3 years where she has learned so much and CSDB gives us some support with her disabilities. Another support group we have been fortunate to find is the Global Foundation of Peroxisomal Disorders (GFPD), which is a resource for families that have a child with PBD. Our family has been able to communicate and meet other families with children with PBDthrough GFPD. This summer they are hosting a conference in Omaha, Nebraska for families and medical professionals passionate about PBD. Jayla will be able to be seen by some of these medical professionals in attendence, along with being able to be around other families and children with PBD. We just need financial help to get there and make this happen. I started this GoFundMe in hopes that our family, friends and new friends can share this and donate so we can pay for the conference fees, hotel, travel expenses and food while we are there. If you want to learn more about Jayla's disorder you can visit  www.thegfpd.org.We appreciate everyone's help!\"),\n",

Since that time, PROPA has organized 5 Bomba Research Conferences and engaged participants from all over the United States and throughout Puerto Rico. The conference was birthed in Chicago and called it home for the first three conferences (2005, 2007, and 2009) before it moved to Puerto Rico where it could draw on historical spaces and involve an older generation that was becoming less mobile and leaving this earth with the memories and experiences of a bygone era for the practice of this creole genre. PROPA is now preparing for its 3rd conference in Puerto Rico (2011, 2013, and 2015) and will add to the communities that have already hosted the conference; those include: Mayagez, Cabo Rojo, Guayama, Catao, Carolina, Piones, Puerta de Tierra, Santurce, and Arroyo. The conference has always been a grassroots effort, relying on in-kind donations for the great majority of the resources utilized. However, there are a number of costs involved with planning and implementing an international conference that is free of charge to any attendee who wants to participate AND steeped in research and tradition; this is where we need your support.

       "  \"Gamelan X has been a Burning Man tradition since its birth on the playa ten years ago. This year we will once again offer daily workshops sharing our own version of the traditional Balinese art of Kecak (aka monkey chant), 3 shows at center camp, as well as other processions and happenings all around the playa. Last year we lost our title of Marching Band Champions (to the super-deserving March Fourth Marching Band), but this year we're determined to win it back. We've also got a few new surprises that we can't wait to share with everyone at the festival. But this year we need some extra help bringing this gift to the festival.Maybe you have seen Gamelan X in the past at Burning Man or some other venue and you already know what it's like to experience us live. Maybe you have some kind of connection to South East Asian art or culture and want to support the joys of live gamelan music to a larger audience. Maybe you have no idea what gamelan or Burning Man are, but simply like the idea of supporting live music that you think is cool.If you are any one of these kinds of people, we wold love to hear from you.The biggest cost that we have to overcome to get to the festival is for the transportation of the gamelan. We need to bring out our large gong cart in order to be able to make our processional ensemble mobile. This will mean renting a truck big enough to fit it as well as the gas to get it to the festival.  In the past this cost has come to $2000.The other transportation cost is for our musicians. We want to do some necessary repairs to fix up our tour bus so we can transport our performers with the minimal amount of gas and vehicles so we can keep our precious campsite as car free as possible. In addition to these transportation costs, we need to do some maintenance on the various stands, carts, harnesses, and cases that physically support the instruments. The big project here is to replace our old and breaking gong stands that we will need for our shows on the Center Camp stage. We have come up with a new system that utilizes easily acquired heavy duty speaker stands that are rated for at least 200 pounds each as well as aluminum cross beam truss systems. These stands will quickly connect via heavy duty drum hardware clamps and the whole system will be much stronger, lighter, and more portable than the old wooden designs that we have literally pushed past their breaking points.  And we can build this new light weight modular system for $500 with your help. While we are asking for help with the transportation and maintenance of the instruments and our performers, we are not seeking funds for our general camp infrastructure or for food. That's all on us. ...so what's in it for you? Well, if you are going to the festival, you can come and chant with us at:   1) HeeBeeGeeBee Healers Camp - Monday to Thursday @ 2pm   2) Center Camp - Friday @ 2pm...or see the band perform at Center Camp on:   1) Wednesday @ 10:30-11:30pm   2) Friday - Annual Marching Band Competition!!! 7:30-9:30pm   3) Saturday @ 1-2pm...or at TEDx on Thursday @ 4pm...or randomly around the playa....and if you are not going to the festival to experience the awesomeness, then we still have these excellent __ for you:$25 donation - Listed as a Supporter on our upcoming appreciation page on gamelanx.com$50 donation - Link to a pre-release of our upcoming EP this Fall.$100 donation - Gamelan X t shirt.

You see, in the beginning I built this company while facing some major and unexpected life challenges. A little after my son was born my lifetook an unexpected turn. Everything as I knew it was flipped upside down. So when life gave me lemons.I made jewelry!Inspired by my son, the jenny present cornerstone collection was born - the Proud Mama collection.Each jenny presentnecklace in this collection is meant to signify a source and to symbolize the people and things you love most in life. Through all of the sleepless nights and bruised fingers (from hand stamping each piece!), I could only dream that these necklaces would be seen dangling around the necks of the most fashionable women around the world (including top celebrities).  See our press attention here.So this is where it gets interesting. Kris Jenner (powerful business woman and celebrity) is infringing on my brand through her trademark application for #proudmama.  But Proud Mama is what Ive built my business on! I am the owner of all right, title and interest in connection with PROUD MAMA, subject of United States Registered Trademark No. 3928036. The registration for the Mark was first issued March 8, 2011.I have spent significant time and expense in developing and promoting the Proud Mama jewelry collection while frequently using the hashtag ProudMama to promote the line. This collection has been featured in numerous magazine articles, endorsed on a number of television shows, and is popular with celebrity moms. Through these efforts, I have developed considerable goodwill in this trademark, and consider this Mark as one of my most valuable assets in my business. In order to maintain the integrity of this Mark, my company actively polices this Mark to prevent public confusion and to prevent dilution. I worry that the use of #PROUDMAMA by Kris Jenner will create a likelihood of confusion; that is, consumers are likely to be misled into believing that Kris Jenners #PROUDMAMA is in some manner authorized, licensed, or otherwise associated with my company or the PROUD MAMA jewelry collection. This constitutes infringement and dilution of my valuable trademark rights. Of course, I dont object to Ms. Jenners use of #proudmama if it is not intended for use in connection with her goods or services  but it appears to be. In fact, it looks like she might have recently started a jewelry collection and, if so, her use of my trademark blurs the line.Being an entrepreneur and a small business owner isnt easy. But nothing can prepare you for what may or may not be thrown at you while chasing your dream. And I need help. I cant do this on my own (even though I may try or want to at times).I will use the money raised to support any and all business ventures I deem appropriate to keep the jenny present brand growing and thriving. My jewelry is meant to inspire and empower the women that wear it. I am fiercely determined to show women (especially single mothers) that no obstacle is too large to overcome. We all fight battles on a daily basis, some bigger than others. I will fight to keep my business going, growing and thriving. Please help me achieve my dreams!

       "  'Where is the best dive to catch a fried fish sandwich in Central Illinois? Answer: THE FISH WAGONThe Fish Wagon can use your help!!!A major unexpected expense has bobbed up for this small family business. (1999-2010): The Fish Wagon is a family-owned and operated food business located in Farmer City, Illinois. It started back in 1999, when Kevin Castle came up with the idea to start a summer venture with his 15-year-old son, Seth. Kevin knew that The Fish Wagon would be the perfect project for the two to spend some real quality time together before his son quickly slipped away into the crazy life of a teenager.  That year, in the early winter months, father and son worked everyday side-by-side gutting and renovating a 1970 Winnebago with one common goal in mind: to have fun together. Their plan was to construct a food-truck capable of selling fried fish sandwiches and to have it up and running by the summertime. Any available free time after work or school was consumed with making this dream a reality. To their surprise, all of that hard work finally paid off, and before they knew it, they were in business. (Photo: The original Fish Wagon) The Fish Wagon was an instant hit with the locals. Together that summer, Kevin and Seth spent every weekend filling hungry bellies with the best fried fish around. Little did they know, this was not just a one-time summer venture, because this small business created a new life for itself.  People from all over started coming to see what all the excitement was about in this small town. As more people came and grew to love the Fish Wagon, they just didn\\'t want to see it go. So, the Castle family pulled together, worked hard, and found the time each summer to keep \"The Wagon\" coming back for the customers. Several years into business, once Seth headed off to college, Kevins wife and teenage daughter stepped in to help him and keep this project alive.  It was originally designed to last only that summer of 99, but the Fish Wagon continued its success for over 10 years. Like they say, All good things must come to an end. A decade quickly flew by; Seth was now graduating college and Kevin still worked a full-time job. The decision to finally close wasnt an easy one, but the forty year-old Winnebago had seen better days. (2014-2015):Almost five years after closing the original Fish Wagon , the outpour of love from patrons continued as they begged for its return. After many months of discussion and debate, Kevin and his daughter, Michelle Castle, made the ultimate decision to re-open the Fish Wagon as a retirement project while giving Michelle the opportunity to pursue a career she already knew and loved.  Their goal was to make the Fish Wagon bigger and better than before. They wanted create a structure that was more permanent, so that this new venture had an opportunity to sustain a real future. The plan was to ditch the mobile food truck and to create an entirely new model such as a carry-out/indoor-seating version of the previous Fish Wagon.  Kevin immediately started looking into potential locations and buildings. He inquired about a Freedom Oil gas station in Farmer City that was run-down and remained vacant for over 20 years. Coincidentally, this building was conveniently located right across the street from where the old Fish Wagon was parked for business all those years before. In December 2014, Kevin purchased this location and a complete renovation was immediately underway. After months of hard work, the Fish Wagon passed all required inspections and was finally ready to be opened by May 2015. Again, it was an instant hit.(Photo: Inside the NEW Fish Wagon)(Photo: Outside New Fish Wagon)(Present): Today, this family business employs six workers total. Currently, the Fish Wagon brings sufficient revenue to cover day-to-day operations and expenses, but recently an unexpected expense has caused a set-back for this start-up business.Because the occupancy of the establishment has been changed from a service station to a restaurant, the state of Illinois requires both male and female handicap-accessible facilities to be available for public use. Currently, asingleunisex restroom is in place, but now is \"illegal\" and no longersufficient according to these state standards.(Photo: Current unisex restroom)Consequently, this bathroom remodel must be completed inorder for this business to remain in compliance with Illinois law and to keep the doors open. Now, avery costly remodel for two new restrooms is underway...(Photo: Construction for new bathrooms has started)Kevin has invested over $85,000 of his own personal funds intothe start-up of the new Fish Wagon. The costs for building these brand new bathrooms have been estimated to a hindering $30,000 (nearly half the cost of the initial start-up investment).Please help save the Fish Wagon and keep this thriving business alive. Every little bit helps and is greatly appreciated. If you are unable to make a monetary donation, you can still help! Please consider sharing this link on Facebook to help spread the word.The Fish Wagon will send a FREE T-shirt to anyone that donates $100 or more to the cause.

Since that 14th day in February 2013 we have filed our provisional patent for intellectual protection and produced several working prototypes.We are raising money to help support our first production run of boards and clothing. This venture has been a blast so far for a young and aspiring 19 year old who has the dream of making a fun and affordable product that can be used year round.We are not trying to perfect years of technology produced by snowboard, sandboard, skimboard or wakeboard manufacturers.KOOL BORDZ is a well rounded board that allows riders of all ages, skill levels, and athletic abilities to have fun riding on multiple surfaces seasonally without the expense of having to purchase a separate board or apparatus. KOOL BORDZ offer a different ride when comparing it to other board types allowing riders to be creative in this evolution of board riding.  We are an upstart and fast growing company.

       "  \"Hello Friends and Family,I'm getting ready to launch my business--Pure Heart Chocolate--next month in Santa Cruz, and I could really use your help! Next month, my truffles hit the bakery shelves and farm stands of Santa Cruz county (and beyond), and I'm in need of some revenue to make it happen. A preliminary list of things I'll need to make this dream a reality includes: *rent on a commercial kitchen*insurance and licensing*a commercial-grade fridge*a commercial-grade freezer*a large chocolate-tempering machine (the one I currently have only allows me to work with 1/2 a pound at a time/about 100 truffles)*a Vitamix to blend up the smoothest ganaches known to humans*a vibrating machine which will allow me to settle the truffle fillings in their molds and create zero mishapen misfits (they still taste good, but the beauty of a perfectly molded truffle is something to behold!)*sustainable and beautiful packaging*marketing and accounting help in the office*and of course, some extra hands in the kitchen to make the magic happen As many of you know, I've been making raw vegan chocoate truffles for the past 5 or so years, perfecting my craft over time, using the kitchen as my creative outlet to make chocolate that is not only more delicious than the mega-produced, waxy, cloyingly sweet variety I could find on store shelves, but more sustainable, too. By leaving out the dairy, the processed sugars, and the hard-to-pronounce preservatives, I found that what I was left with was cacao in its purest form-- raw, unadulterated, and incredibly delicious. This cacao, in its purest, most sacred form, is what I offer with Pure Heart Chocolate. I look forward to your feedback (pun intended, heh) and to sharing my love of chocolate with YOU.

Wenow havethe opportunity to introduce some new levelsto Food2611. That dream is just within ourreach! We have already secured the building, liquor license, food license and start up capital which is a $119,000 investment but we need a little more help to revamp the interior and purchase some additional kitchen equipment. Whether we raise $50.00 or are blessed enough to reach our goal, we will be opening February 3, 2015. Any funds beyond our goal will be used in the foundation of our non profit organization, Chefs with Wings.Ourrestaurant will not only be a place where patrons can dine on a menu based on Michigan themed food and drinks, but will also serve as a base for our food delivery service and catering. All of our meals will be hand crafted from scratch, from fresh pasta to grinding our own meat. We will also use local produce to keep revenue in the community and our menu will be seasonal, changing as the seasons change. Our beverages will be focused on Michigan beer and wines and we're hoping to work with a local distillery to stock our shelves. But, what we aremost excited about is the non-profit aspect that is planned! In the past year I had the honor of working with youth in the State of Michigan's Foster Care program. I am working with this organization to continue mentoring these kids in the kitchen where they can learn a valuable skill and gain experience and ethics in the workforce. The focus of these teens will be the non-profit organization I'm putting together called Chefs with Wings. They will learn to make meals to be provided to families who have a child suffering from a terminal illness. Not only will these kids get work experience, but they will get a sense of gratitude knowing that they are providing relief to families who are going through a difficult time. With your help we will be able to update the building to make it more suitable for our mission. The funding will help to purchase 2 sous vide machines and additional burners to accomodate extra staff in the kitchen. It will also go towards fresh paint to brighten up the interior, building a private wine room and updating the bathrooms with new tile. This building was a former bar and our goal is to transform it into an American Bistro styled restaurant. In the upcoming days, we will post a video touring the building and talking more about our plans for the future.I sincerely thank you for your consideration and I understand that not everybody is in a position to donate, but would greatly appreciate if you could share my story with your friends and family!Thank you, again!Sincerely,Chef BradFood2611\"),\n",

       "  'Don\\'t you hate when Life gets in the way of having a good time?The cancer is back - this is the 7th one in nearly 12 years, and more complicated than before because it split into (wait for it....) TWO cancers! We still have the old slow moving one that\\'s easy enough to swat at when it gets big enough. Now let\\'s add to that one that is red, and mean, and (if a cancer had intentions) intends on kiling me. That ain\\'t gonna happen.So having raised enough funding to get the downpayment on my car (keep reading for that part) I\\'m now devoting this campaign to helping with the excruciating expenses of multiple hospital stays, and other fun stuff not covered by insurance. There\\'s a lot of them.I\\'m not giving up and I\\'m not giving in.Each chemo treatmentrequires a 5 day stay in the hospital (I was in-patient for over 20 days in December 2016) and the daily medications run around $500 + per month, including the stuff that insurance doesn\\'t cover at all. It\\'s a lot.So there\\'s still plenty to do! I\\'m still driving (well, as much as I can right now - i\\'m temporarily off the road until all this chemo clears out of my body.) I\\'m still moving forward with every intention of getting on with and moving along with life. Let\\'s just get past this one little setback and then back to our show....It\\'s time to bust out and take the next step in life!I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma AND end-stage liver disease in the spring of 2005. Over the years, I\\'ve been through 6 rounds of chemo, more side effects from cancer drugs than you can imagine. Now, 11 years later, settling into \"life with cancer\"withone of those medical conditions that can go into remission but will never completely go away.I\\'ve also been selling stuff - art, antiques, estate items, etc - online since 2001, and have had a great time with that. I\\'ve met tons of new people, had fun at lots of auctions and estate sales, and generally had the time of my life! So much so, that it\\'s time to get out of this house, and take this whole business thing to the next level:This spring, I started a test of my first \"brick and moartar\" store - in an antiques mall, 130 miles away - and so far it\\'s a great success. So much that I\\'m thinking of adding one more, as much as post-chemo energy will let me do. I save up my energy to spendon things I love like hanging with my auction friends, and researching my \"what IS this?\" shelf.Along the way I found a deep love for the art of North Carolina pottery. I grew up right in the middle of the Catawba Valley tradition of NC folk pottery and didn\\'t even know it. My house is now full of the stuff, and I genuinely love finding it so I can re-home it to collectors and decorators.Since the store is so far away (I go there 1-2 times/month) I need a *hauler* kind of car for the trip. I usually carry 5-6 tubs of carefully bundled new merchandise with me, spend a week there schmoozing with my antiquer friends and stay with my mom who lives in that area.I also need a car for things like trips to the post office to drop off packages, supply runs, and the ever important auction and sale trips to find the best merchandise I can for my store(s). It\\'s a lot of driving around in short trips, and I love to drive.To keep doing this AND to look for a second such shop, I need to upgrade my car to something like the old station wagon. This iswhere you can help. Every $1.00 donated helps and is totally appreciated.Here\\'s my plan:I set this goal in the $16,000 - $18,000 range as that is my entire budget for getting a car. I hope to get enough here to at least make the down payment. If it\\'s necessary I willfinance the rest. A decade-plus of medical debt does awful things to one\\'s credit scores, so it willdefinitely be by a sub-prime auto loan, and they have extremely high interest rates. Hopefully this campaign can help avoid that as much as possible.***What does 18 grand get you these days in a \"hauler\" type car?***This is for a vehicle (a car - no trucks or delivery vans) that\\'s 100% business. NO personal use.I\\'m looking for something station wagon-like for packing in the tubs of merchandise plus me, plus Dynah Thurst, the long hair Pom/Daschund mix who goes with me on the long trips. She loves to travel, and she loves to travel in her little crate so she\\'s always safe!The old hauler - unfortunately killed by a drunk driver. Don\\'t worry - we got out ok but our beloved MINI didn\\'t survive. And no, that is NOT Miz Dynah\\'s basket on top.Because of that long drive from home to the store, I need it to be a comfortable long trip car because I tire out easily.The more comfortable the car, the fewer rest stops. It\\'s about a 3 hour drive each way, with traffic.Great gas mileage is a must because every fill-up comes out of the bottom line of the business. Thegoal of all this selling stuffisto turn a profit to help pay some of these horrible medical bills that pile up every year like cord wood.I want to stay active as much as I can, for as long as I can, to help my family and caregivers support this long and drawn out disease process. And try to help others along the way, if I can.If I were buying today, the final total would purchase a 2013-ish Toyota Prius with low milesfor its age . We have had Prius in our family for years so I know them in and out and it\\'s a very nice car, all jokes aside about hybrids.Plus, to get out of the house more (Doctors\\' orders!) I want tobe able to offer rides with the car to folks in my area who need a lift to their doctor\\'s appointments and need a vehicle that can hold a wheelchairif necessary. My own past wheelchair experience when I was very sick taught me that the Prius fits the bill, as do a few other smaller/roomy high MPG cars.If it can carry tubs of merchandise, it can carry a wheelchair, so why not put that space in a high MPG car to use for the better good?The reason for that is that when I was very bad off with cancer and could not walk at all, some very nice people in my church parish and in the community helped get me to appointments and support group meetings. I\\'m well enough now - for the time being - that it\\'s time for me to return the favor.And when I\\'m gone, as in ... dirt nap... it\\'s in my will that the car *(assuming it\\'s all paid for!) should either be donated to a cause that helps patients get rides to their appointments, or that someone in my family will use the car for this noble purpose. If they don\\'t: I promise you I will haunt them!If you\\'d like to read more about my whole cancer journey, I keep a health journal on Caring Bridge, just click on this link: John Myers: The Dance .It\\'s time now to step up and get busy with this store. My next step is to add on a new retail selling blog with my store merchandise, plus plenty of how-to information about antiquing and collecting. The site is being built in our super-secret laboratories right now and should launch \"any day now,\" with its own Facebook page (watch this page for more info!)It\\'s a lot to keep up with. I miss that kind of schedule from my old retail/marketing/email diva days.I have a bit more energy to build as much of that as I have time. And then me and the dogs take a nap.I hate sitting around the house. I loathe watching any sort of daytime TV. Oh, and I\\'m self-teaching myself bluegrass music on the viola (don\\'t ask) but that\\'s a whole other story.For each and every donation, and even for your positive comments and good wishes, Dynah and Iboth offer our unending thanks, and wish you all the best as we put this plan on the road!Thank you so much for your help, thoughts, and prayers.John and Dyna Thyrrst.'),\n",

People have come along side us to help and encourage us. We are very excited to use this to help us raise and track the money that we have to use for the adoption. As many people know this is a very expensive process, but we know that God can provide and we are so blessed to know that He could use you to help.

       "  'BECOMING A FAMILY OF 7: Ty is a student from Moody Bible Institute who came to live with us in January 2014 and quickly became very much a part of our family. In May, his mom (the aunt who raised him) passed away. His uncle, the only father he\\'s ever really known, passed away when he was seven. While Ty does have some connections with his birth family and the cousins he was raised with, we have essentially become his family. We have together chosen to formally pursue an adult adoption. The state of Illinois only requires the consent of the adult adoptee and that the adoptee has lived with the family for 2 years prior to adopting. Our landlord originally granted permission for Ty to live with us for 6 months. None of us anticipated how deeply connected we would become in that short time. He is a son to us and a big brother to our other children in every way. I smile every time he calls us \"Moms\" and \"Pops.\" We recently approached our landlord and told her we were planning to legally adopt Ty and asked permission for him to continue to live with us while he is attending Moody Bible Institute for graduate school the next year and a half, so that we can meet the two year living requirement for adoption. She said yes ... for an extra $350/month. Ty isn\\'t a minor and isn\\'t legally adopted yet, so he falls through a loophole in the lease that would otherwise include him without a rent increase. We have two more years on the lease, so finding another place to live isn\\'t really an option. We either need to pay the extra $350/month, which we cannot afford, or Ty will have to relocate and we will not be able to adopt him. Ty has enriched our family and we will always proudly consider him our son. We would love to make that formal through adoption. Yes, he is an adult. But even adults benefit from having parents, siblings and a place to call home. Our goal is to raise $5,950 dollars to cover the increase in rent needed for Ty to remain with us the next 17 months, so that we can legally become a family.'),\n",

       "  \"This is my nephew, Jonah. His mother, my sister, passed away suddenly in 2012 from a pulmonary embolism. Since then, I have had legal guardianship. My husband and I really would like to adopt Jonah.You see, Jonah has had a pretty tough life in his short 7 years. He was born premature at 26 and half weeks and spent the first 3 months of his life in the NICU at Loma Linda. When he went home, he suffered abuse at the hands of his father, causing some head trauma and the detachment of the lens on his left eye.Jonah also has mild cerebral palsy which could be from being born premature or from the abuse (we don't know for sure). My sister and mother worked very hard with the Inland Regional Center to loosen his muscles. We have also worked extensively with occupational therapists to build his gross and fine motor skills. Today, Jonah's CP is hardly noticable. Though he is in a Special Day Class at school, he is learning and growing by leaps and bounds.Jonah has always been a part of my family as my sister and I were very close. She loved me so much, she left me her greatest gift, the person she loved more than anything. I have done my best to fill my sister's shoes and honor her legacy. I love this little boy with all my heart. There is nothing I wouldn't do for him. I have worked with teachers and therapists, I have attended every IEP meeting and conference, I have given him a home and a loving family.Now, I need your help. What I want to give him, more than anything, is a home and a sense of permanence. I need to make sure he is safe, to make sure he can never be taken away from us. My husband and I would love to adopt Jonah, but it is expensive. The basic cost is $2500 for the lawyer and another $5000 for investigative fees. Please help me raise the funds to keep my little boy in the home with people who love him.Thank you so much!\"),\n",

       "  'Dear Friends and Family,As many of you know, Karlee and I have struggled with infertility for the last four years. This struggle has been difficult for us emotionally, physically, spiritually and financially. We had a consultation with our infertility doctors a few months ago, it turned out the cost of doing another In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) would be much higher than we originally expected. Karlee had a negative reaction to the medication during our first failed IVF that reduced the chances of success. If we attempted another IVF it would require different and more expensive medicine. Karlee was heart-broken to hear of how much the cost rose and that we could not afford to try one more time.Many friends and family have told us that they would love to help with the costs so we can attempt another IVF. My pride has stood in the way of ever doing something like this. But this Christmas, I would like to surprise Karlee with the opportunity to try IVF one more time. She has been so strong through this journey and I know we all want to help her dream of being a mother come true. She has no idea that I am reaching out to all of you and that I have set this up. I have setup a Go Fund Me account where anyone can contribute to this cause.I will be surprising Karlee on Christmas morning so please do not let her know. Please forward this link to anyone that may be interested but please do not share on social media as she may catch wind of it.Thank you all for your love and prayers,CurtisOur Journey:This journey began for us four years ago in December 2011, when we decided we were ready to start having children. Karlee had always wanted to have children and after three years of marriage I finally gave in. Karlees dream job was to be a stay-at-home mom. We were both overjoyed and thankful to God when we became pregnant our very first month of trying. We were both so excited and immediately began combing through possible baby names. Karlee tried hard to wait to make any purchases but it seemed like every other day she saw something she just couldnt pass up and needed for our baby. Seeing our babys ultrasound and hearing the heartbeat was one of the happiest days of our lives.We decided to let family and close friends know about the pregnancy but had decided to wait until she was at 13 weeks to announce it publicly. When Karlee was 12 weeks and 6 days pregnant, it took us a little longer to fall asleep that night. We kept discussing the fun ways we would announce to our coworkers the next morning and the Facebook post for extended family and friends to see. Unfortunately, a few hours later, Karlee woke me up due to some excruciating pain she was experiencing and we rushed to the nearest hospital. I have never seen someone as strong as Karlee was that night, knowing that she was having a miscarriage she endured both the physical and emotional pain. We had many friends visit us in the hospital and Karlees mom flew out to be with her while she recovered. Our church family surrounded us that following week and showered us with Gods love and comfort. We got through that week, knowing that God had a plan and a purpose.We thought since we had gotten pregnant our first month of trying, it would only take a few months to get pregnant after Karlees recovery. The months went by and each month we were disappointed, but tried to remain positive. The months turned into years and we decided to reach out to infertility specialists to see if the miscarriage had caused any damage that may be hindering our ability to conceive. After multiple months of tests, we praised God that there was nothing wrong with either Karlee or myself. The doctors prescribed some medication that would enhance the ability to conceive. Karlee was on this for multiple months and endured the negative effects of extreme hormonal imbalance. When this did not work, the doctors recommended a procedure called IUI. After 3 failed and costly attempts at IUI, our doctors told us that for two healthy individuals, with unexplained infertility and had been trying for multiple years; the next step was In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). We had never imagined coming to this point in our journey to become parents. After much prayer, we decided to go through with the procedure and emptied our savings. During the process, Karlee had a negative reaction to one of the medications. The reaction countered many of the other drugs Karlee was taking and the chances of this IVF being successful dropped significantly. Per the doctors advice, we continued through the entire procedure but a month afterward received the negative results that it had failed. Karlee was both physically and emotionally drained, so we decided to take a step back from the medical route.We constantly struggled with the question of why us and what Gods purpose was. When we moved up to Redding, we saw a huge need in the community for foster parents. We had never dreamed of being foster parents and knew it would be out of our comfort zone. However, we felt maybe God was pushing us in this direction and that we could turn something positive out of our infertility struggles. It took much longer than we expected to become certified and the foster agents we worked with were some of the most difficult people I have ever encountered. We finally started to receive placement calls but instead of the 0-3 age range we had requested, we kept getting difficult calls (like 3 kids under the age of 3 or 10 year olds with behavioral issues). We knew as first-time foster parents, these types of placements would not be healthy for Karlee and I or for the children. After months of these types of placement calls and the emotionally ups and downs, we decided we need to take a step back from the fostering route also.December marks the end of the fourth year of trying to conceive and one year since our failed IVF. Karlee and I both feel that we will become pregnant if we did another IVF without using the medicine that Karlees body had a negative reaction to. A few months ago, we came up with a plan on how to save and pay for another IVF procedure that we thought would be around $10,000. However, after our consultation with our doctor and realizing the amount of the special medication needed it turned out the entire process would cost $18,000. Karlee was heart-broken as we both knew that this was not financial feasibility for us to do.After telling some family and close friends, many said they would love to help. A few suggested setting up a Go Fund Me account. My pride has stood in the way of doing something like this. I have always seen a major role in our marriage to be provide everything my wife needs and wants. Karlees number one desire has been to have a child to love and care for and this is something out of my ability to provide. God has really humbled me through this infertility journey. Karlee and I have grown extremely close through all the ups and downs and God has strengthened our marriage. We both rely much more on God to provide our every need and we both strive to focus on the positives this journey has provided rather than dwell on the negatives. We still dont know if this journey will lead us to becoming parents naturally, through IVF, through adoption or through fostering. What we do know is that God knows the desires of our heart and he has a plan for us.As you all know, Karlee has the biggest heart of anyone I know. Through all of these ups and downs she has remained the positive, happy person we all love to be around. When she walks in the room, she is the life of the party and she brightens everyones day. She is constantly volunteering to take care of everyones kids and she loves to spoil the kids in our lives. I thought that this Christmas, would be an amazing opportunity to shower her with love and provide her with one more opportunity to be a mother. I set up this Go Fund Me account for all of our friends and family that have been a part of this journey and would like to help make this possibility a reality.My hope is to surprise her Christmas morning with this Go Fund Me account and the chance to do one more IFV. Please feel free to distribute this story and link via email but please do not do so on social media. I am trying to keep this as much of a secret and surprise for her.Thanks you so much for all of your love and support the last couple years and please continue to keep us in your prayers.'),\n",

       "  'Dear friend,Early in our marriage, God put in our hearts the passion and conviction to adopt a child. Over the past few years, God has been revealing to us through His Word what adoption really means and the way it shows us, once again, a reflection of His unwavering mercy for a humanity created after His own image.At the end of 2014 we found a recognized organization for adoption named Bethany Christian Services of Missouri. After a time of prayer and consideration, we had the strong conviction that we needed to begin our process of adoption with them. We are trusting that this is one of the ways in which God is leading us to establish His Kingdom in our home.This adoption process involves expenses that surpass our budget and current financial capabilities. God provided the amount needed to submit our application form, and weve been just notified that it was approved. Now, the next step is the phase one the home study, training and case management, for which we need to pay $9,000. The phase two cost $13,500 to submit the time of the child being placed at home that include but no limited to hospital planning, preparation of legal and court documents, legal paperwork for birth parents and appearance in court.We are sharing this with you because we know there is no way we could fulfill Gods dream for our family on our own. We know that Gods heart is for homeless and abandoned children to be placed in godly, loving families.  We are eager to be Jesus for a little one who may not know family in any other way. Can you please help us? If not, can you please share our calling and vision with someone that may be able to? We need to reach our $22,500 goal by December 31st, 2015. As for now, we appreciate immensely whatever contribution given or effort you could make for this page to reach others.

       "  'A little five-year-old girl had a big idea: when she grew up, she was going to adopt a child. Her dream was so big that she often pretended her Cabbage Patch Dolls were her adopted children, and as she held them she would tell them their special adoption stories of how they were chosen and loved. She grew up daydreaming about what her adopted child would look like and where it might be born. China? Uganda? The Philippines? Another American state?When she was a teenager she began borrowing adoption books from the library and scouring adoption agency websites, and before she was even old enough to drive she already knew the ins and outs of the adoption process. Her parents, sisters, friends, and grandparents knew that she dreamed of adopting one day. It was her Biggest Dream Ever. Then one summer night at a picnic, she told her big dream to somebody new. This new person told her that everybody would love to adopt if they could afford it, but nobody can afford it, so nobody can ever adopt.Her dream almost died that day. But the idea kept flickering inside her and she couldnt get it out of her head. Even if it was true that she could never afford to adopt her child, she couldnt stop hoping.When she met the man she was going to marry, she asked him if he could ever love an adopted child. He had never thought of adopting before, but the more he considered the idea, the more he liked it. \"Yes,\" he promised her. \"I will love our adopted child as if it were born to us.\"Her dream almost died another day too, the day she almost died. There was a crash, and sirens, and too much blood, and not enough air, and the man she was going to marry and her parents and sisters and grandparents and friends thought they might have to say goodbye to her that day. But so many people prayed that God decided to do a miracle and heal her, and she married the man she was going to marry, and for five years they have waited and prayed and waited and prayed for something very special, and now its time.They are ready to adopt the child that they have wanted for so long. They call it their Davendarling. At first they were planning to adopt a baby born in the United States, but God brought their attention to a special little girl in an orphanage in the Philippines who needs a family, and they took one look at her and realized that she is the one they\\'ve been waiting for all this time. They have found their Davendarling. Now they just need to bring her home.With the help of family and friends, they are confident that their daughter will soon be in their arms. Please help Donna and Jason bring home their Davendarling.Will it be easy? Nope. Worth it? Absolutely.'),\n",

       "  'Our Infertility Journey\\nMikie and I got married in 2005 and even though we were 25, we thought we were still so young. So we decided to wait a few years before trying to get pregnant. In 2007, I stopped taking birth control and we said \"whatever happens, happens\" but we weren\\'t going to officially \"try.\" After 2 years of nothing happening and purchasing our new home, we started actually trying and obsessing over temperatures, counting days, and other timing tricks. Then in 2010, I finally talked to my doctor who scheduled tests for both of us. After those results, we were referred to an infertility specialist who basically told us our best option for pregnancy was IVF (in vitro fertilization). We weren\\'t ready for all of that at the time--and definitely did not have that kind of money--so we asked to try artificial insemination first (which is a lot cheaper). We tried that twice within those next couple of years, but it was unsuccessful. The stress and heartache of what we were dealing with, and looking at going forward, was too much and we decided to take a couple years off from obsessing over it and just relax--even though I secretly hoped for a miracle every month, but alas (at least) 24 more negative pregnancy tests later, still no Baby Lowe. Then in 2014, our infertility clinic started offering something called Natural Cycle IVF--less drugs, less eggs, and (most importantly) less money. We were excited about this opportunity and did our first IVF cycle that year. We ended up with 2 little baby embryos! We were so excited to transfer one of them, but right before Christmas we got the news that it didn\\'t work and I wasn\\'t pregnant. We were so disappointed and sad, but we had hope for our other little frozen embryo and for the start of a new, fresh year. In May of 2015, we transferred the frozen one and were so overjoyed and grateful when I turned out to be pregnant. But, unfortunately, that Baby Lowe became our Baby Angel and is waiting on us in Heaven. We were so devastated and so heartbroken over our loss and what we thought was our only chance. But even though it\\'s still painful, we pushed on because we refuse to give up on our dream to be parents. In 2016, we refinanced our house, cashed out stocks, borrowed money from family, and scrounged every penny we had, and we actually went through 2 more IVF cycles. Both were failures, we didn\\'t even end up with any viable embryos. This whole journey has been so emotionally draining and frustrating. We just don\\'t understand why something that should be the easiest thing in the world is so hard for us. Friends tell us we\\'re strong, but we don\\'t feel very strong--we couldn\\'t have survived all of this without God giving us His strength and showing us the way, and without a lot of people praying for us. We have this desire in our hearts to be parents, and we have faith that the desire is not there for no reason. And so, after a new procedure, we have decided to try one more time (maybe 4th time\\'s a charm?), and we are praying that this time is the time God has planned for. And if not, we will just have to move on to other options, because as I said before, we will never give up! So today we are asking for financial help (since we have cleaned out all savings, etc for the other 3 times), believe me any little bit will definitely help. We hate that we have to ask for donations for this, but you know the saying \"desperate times calls for desperate measures,\" and we are so desperate to get our Baby Lowe and finally have the family that we have always dreamed of.\\nThanks and love,\\nLori & Mikie Lowe'),\n",

A couple that is continually knocked down by life yet pulls it together and presses forward. This is Nicole and Jon. This is the couple whose story needs to be told and I hope funds can be raised to help them with the fertility treatments to become the parents they deserve to be.Ive known Nicole for over a decade. She is the friend who will drop anything to be by your side. She will put aside the pain in her heart in order to be genuinely happy for her friends and family. As long as I have known her, she always wanted a family but waited to find the right guy, a good guy. Lets be honest, thats a mission in and of itself. In 2010, Nicole finally met Jonathan. The man she always hoped and dreamed for - a man that treated her like the queen she is. After a few years of dating, Jon and Nicole exchanged vows in May of 2013.After becoming married they decided to start a family. Nicole has always suffered from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. PCOS is where a womans hormones are out of balance and your periods can become irregular making it difficult to become pregnant. In June of 2014, after a year of trying, Nicole was overjoyed to see a bright plus sign on her pregnancy test. Unfortunately, on July 2 at 7 weeks pregnant, their world shattered. Nicole miscarried and they were both distraught by the sudden loss of their first child. As a close friend seeing the pain in her eyes, it is a hurt I wouldnt wish on anyone. After grieving their loss, they decided God had a plan; they kept their faith strong to move forward and not give up on their dream of having a family. After another 6 months of trying Nicole and Jon were blessed with another chance of becoming parents. The sense of delight they experienced after seeing another positive and another opportunity was overpowering. They had their first ultrasound at 8 weeks. This appointment crushed their souls. During the ultrasound the technician delivered the heart wrenching news that although their baby was growing perfectly, the baby implanted itself in Nicoles fallopian tube (ectopic pregnancy), which could be deadly not only for Nicole but for their baby. Nicole was immediately brought to the ER, had surgery and on January 30, 2015 they lost their second child and Nicole lost her left fallopian tube. With now only one working tube, still having PCOS and over 10 months of trying again, Jon and Nicole decided to seek a fertility specialist. This was a decision they did not take lightly. They believe God has a plan for them however, with one working fallopian tube she will never know if she actually ovulates. Nicole and Jon are hard working (If you know Greeks-N-Sweets you know the many hours Nicole works) however, even with her ability to create beautiful and inspiring cookies the cost for the treatments are currently out of their reach. They do have insurance, however, their insurance doesnt cover the treatments they will have to undergo. If Nicole or Jonathanever helped put a smile on your face, you will find it in your heart to donate to this worthy cause that will help put a permanent smile on theirs.'),\n",

As many of you know, this path is long, tiring, and filled with MANY UNKNOWNS. But, what we DO know is that God has chosen us to be her forever family and we are beyond blessed. We love her already! This process is costly on every level, but her little life is WORTH IT! Every child's life is precious and they all deserve a family. Dan and I know that we are called to walk this road. And, we are inviting you to join in our journey:to SHARE IN OUR MIRACLE. Giving to the cause of adoption is a tangible way to really make a difference in the world:in HER WORLD and in ours. Would you consider contributing to our adoption fees and travel expenses?  We have been working towards this adoption for a year and a half now and have already paid some of our costs. We are starting this fundraiser to help us with the remaining fees and with our considerable travel expenses. We have payment deadlines for the adoption fees in July and in Oct. Then, we will just need to focus on our travel costs. We are required to travel to South Korea twice. We don't have any definitive dates for travel, yet. The best estimate is that it will be sometime between Jan and May 2014. The first trip will be to MEET TESSA and to attend a court hearing for her visa approval. Approximately a month later, we leave for the second trip to finalize her visa and citizenship and to BRING HER HOME. Because we are only given 7-10 days travel notice, these trips are very costly. But, like I said before, she is worth it! And, at the end of this journey, a little girl will have a forever family and we will have our daughter. To us, that is priceless!  We are so grateful for all the love and support we have been given in the past. We have been so blessed! Our two amazing boys are a constant reminder of God's faithfulness to us. And, Dan and I have felt His hand at work in EVERY DETAIL of this process. We TRUST that He will see us through! Know that we are so grateful for any and every donation:and for your PRAYERS. They are equally as valuable to us. Thank you for caring for our family and for our baby girl on her way home. Every dollar given is one step closer to wrapping her in our arms!!!

       "  \"Shortly after our wedding, we knew that our family was not complete with just the two of us. We both dreamed of having a life that included a child. A boy, a girl, a basketball player, a dancer, a pitcher, a musician, we didnt care. A year after our wedding, we began the journey of starting our family and what a journey it has become! Together, we have decided that we are being led through this process to adopt the last piece of the puzzle in order to make our dream of a family a reality.We are now reaching out to you, our friends and family, to share our news and ask for your support. First we would like to ask for prayer for us and prayer for the adoption in general. While we know that adoption is the course we are supposed to take, there a few pieces of the adoption puzzle we are still trying to find in the box. So prayer for clarity as we look for those final pieces. The second prayer request is for the birth mother. Kind of like dad's heart transplant meant that someone had to lose a loved one for us to keep ours; an adoption means that the birth mother will lose a child for us to gain our family. There is a loss there. So pray that God will calm the birth mother's heart and to know that we will care for the child the best that we can, and that we will raise the child in a Christ centered way.While we believe this is where we are being led, this path is not without its hurdles. The main hurdle is the cost of the adoption. The overall cost is...wellits a lot! So, we are beginning with the first of four fundraisers. In this first fundraiser, we are literally asking you to help complete our puzzle. Here is how it worksWe have a 1,000 piece Disney puzzle. Our life together started with a Disney wedding, so what better way to start our childs life than with Disney as well! We are selling each piece of the puzzle for $15. On the back of the puzzle piece, the name of each donor will be written. By purchasing a piece, you will have your name on this puzzle helping to start our childs story and supporting our journey. Once each piece has been sold, we will put this puzzle together.

       "  'These precious girls are Rebekah\\'s four newest sisters and they are excited to finally welcome her home to join our family.  They each havetheir own stories of how God miraculously provided for them to come home too! Now it\\'s Rebekah\\'s turn! She has no idea what love lies ahead and the wonderful things God has planned for her precious life! Until just over one year ago, none of us had a clue what it would mean to adopt a child with Down Syndrome. 8 year old Abby changed all of that- and we are all convinced that our lives will never be the same again! So much so, that we are throwing our arms wide open to a second child from China with Down Syndrome... A six year old little girl, soon to be given the nameRebekah Charity McCary! This precious child (pictured below at a summer camp) was abandoned when she was 2 and 1/2 years old and without a family of her own, faced a very bleak future. But God reached down and chose her- much like He reached down and chose each of us! It is an honor and a great privilege to be a part of His plan for this precious, little girl, half a world away. We\\'d like to ask if you might consider what \"small things you can do\" to help us, \"and together we can do something wonderful\" in the life of one young girl.Just like our other 4 adoptions, Rebekah\\'s journey home is long and expensive. Our costs for her adoption fromChina totals about $30,000. Unfortunately, with only a few weeks until Lori travels to bring Rebekah home, we still have a financial need of approximately $15,000. This is not new to us and we have watched in the past how God has ALWAYS provided for each of our girls to come home. He has never failed! Our faith is unshaken and we believe that He will do the same again. We simply ask that you consider how you might be a part of His provision for our family. If with financial assistance- we would be humbled and so grateful. If with diligent prayers on our behalf, even more grateful! Our needs are great on every side and we desperately need the prayers that strengthen us and keep our eyes securely fixed on Christ.  Lori will travel to China again without Doug (and will take a friend and one of our girls), because he must remain at home to not only care for Abby in Lori\\'s absence, but also to stand vigil with Rachel as she waits for the gift of life through a heart transplant. She is presently at the top of the transplant list and the phone call we have waited for could finally come. Much help would obviously be needed from every side should that occur while Lori is away, but we are ready and confident that the God who has orchestrated it all, is also sovereign over every single detail of this journey. We trust Him and humbly ask that you remember us as you pray in the coming weeks and months. God has already graciously supplied almost half of our financial need for Rebekah\\'s adoption. But our accounts are still short the remaining $15,000. needed to complete her adoption, even now as travel draws so near. These funds are needed for the bulk of our travel expenses and to pay the Chinese orphanage \"donation\" of over $6,000., in addition to the other agency and legal fees required.  All donations will be applied to these adoption expenses and then ongoing medical and therapy expenses for Rebekah\\'s care when she gets home.May God bless you as you give to bring HOPE to one of \"the least of these\" in His name.We are so grateful for your support! Thank You!!'),\n",

McCOMAS        Give Respect And Compassion to Everyone!In a world that sometimes seems to get more cold and divisive by the day, Grace Katherine McComas was a bright light. Joyful, funny and sweet, Grace was known for her good humor and kind heart. The first to welcome a newcomer, she wasempathetic to the needs of people and other living things. An engaging and articulate teen, Grace was active in music, sports and community service.This video was put together by her father David the week of her death...\\n\\nAt age 14, everything changed for her and her family on a summer evening in June, after a drug-assisted sexual assault, later followed by hateful, malicious and threateningcyber abuse, sexual harassment and bullying. Grace\\'s familyknew what was happening, and tried to get help from multiple public agencies who frankly not only failed to help properly, but have attempted to hide their negligence. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j25Vavsiej4)Grace died by suicide at age 15 on Easter Sunday 2012.     Grace K. McComas Memorial WebpageMaryland\\'s Grace\\'s Law now protects children from         repeated, malicious cyberbullying. For several years, the Howard County Public School System in Maryland refused to mention anything about Grace, including this law or allow any kind of remembrance. Even her school records, detailing the last year of her life were withheld fromher family.While fighting for her child\\'s voice to be heard, Christine McComas met wonderful, determined mothers/advocates who were also being denied truth and transparency from the school system. One of these was Barb Krupiarz, a great champion of the special ed community. After being denied the results of a $300,000 taxpayer funded special ed study (in fact she was told there were no results) shewent to court to have it released, and instead was punished/fined in a retaliatory way- almost $10,000 !(See this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9YxG79Ctks)Christine and Barb both testified at a public hearing in December 2015 in support of a bill to have the Maryland Public Access Ombudsman look into public information denials by the school system since the (now former)Superintendent was hired. Theymet when Christine asked Barbto hold Grace\\'s picture while she testified, well after midnight, and the bill was passed by the Maryland legislature a few months later. The report from the investigation ( www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/OpenGov%20Documents/PAO/Final%20HB%201105%20report.pdf )found serious violations in public information compliance by HCPSS.At the sudden \\'retirement\\' of the former Superintendent,new leadership at the helm of HCPSS has begun righting wrongs, and the first of which is Barb Krupiarz getting her money back.She shocked the McComas family by immediately saying she wanted to put it towards a scholarship to honor and remember Grace!! Truly an unexpected, generous and GRACIOUS kindness to come out of a dark and difficult experience many had trying to bring about truth. GOOD WINS.Barb Krupiarz and Grace\\'s mom Christine met with the Community Foundation of Howard County to learn about how a scholarship is set up and managed.In order to have a scholarship presented in Grace\\'s name every year, the Howard County Community Foundation scholarship fund requires $20,000, plus an initial \"cushion\" to keep the levels above $20K. The McComas familyis adding $5,000 that community members had donated to a memorial fund upon her death, in addition to the $9,300 of Barb\\'s \\'sanction money\\'.We are hoping forcommunity donations of $10,000 to have Grace remembered by a school system who did not help her and to provide scholarships to students who exemplify and encourage kindness.Christine and Barb are also planning to create a nonprofit organization to advocate and educate about G.R.A.C.E. and those issues related to peace, hope and needed social change.Any money donated above the $10,000 will go towards the creation of this organization.Imagine what this world could be if the inherent dignity of each human was respectedand cared for.

He was taken to the emergency hospital in Flagstaff and then things just got worse so He was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix.\\n\\n At the Mayo Clinic he had seizure of some sort and was placed in a medically induced coma. A tracheotomy was performed and he was placed on a ventilator.

He had become a quadriplegic, he was mute and could only communicate with his eyes.He stayed at the Mayo Clinic for several weeks thenhe was then transferred on a private jet plane to UCLA Medical Center in West Los Angeles for further research but they also could not find a diagnosis. He stayed there close to two months.After UCLA he was transferred to a sub-acute care facility and there he began moving a little more and his left side started waking up and later transferred to Long Beach Memorial for intense rehab.

       "  'Well, to begin, the root of my problem is that I was not born in the U.S. I was born in Mexico, but I was brought over to the U.S. before I even turned a year old, so I cant really say Ive actually been to Mexico. My parents, who are now divorced are also Mexican, so the topic of getting or having a job has always been quite difficult to talk about. My dad, who Ive stayed with for the last three years, is a self-employed sub-contractor. Although he may not have an actual company, or workers he is responsible for, he has never failed to provide for me, my older brother, and my two younger sisters. When we came to the U.S, we lived in a small apartment in Balch Springs, TX., just twenty minutes outside of Dallas. After living for about two years there, we moved to the house where weve lived for the past fifteen years or so. When I started school at Walter E. Floyd Elementary, I was always one of the kids who seemed to grasp concepts better and faster than others. Throughout third, fourth, and fifth grades, I received Commended on all of my end of year TAKS tests, which was not extremely unique, but very recognizable. Fortunately, in our district, there was a program, Quest, available to students who displayed the same qualities I did at young ages. In this program, which was available to students from third to sixth grade, one designated day a week, a bus would pick up students from each of the elementary schools, and take us to another elementary school, that had a designated section of the school for the classrooms in which we occupied on the days we went. After completing all four years of quest, I moved onto G.T. classes at A.C. New Middle School. G.T. (Gifted and Talented) classes usually had no more than fifteen students in any of the core classes, like English, Math, Social Studies, and Science. Since I was four I played soccer, both recreationally and competitively, but in seventh and eighth grade I made both the basketball and football teams. One of my highest goals when I was in elementary and middle school was to play for my high schools soccer team. My freshmen year at West Mesquite High School, I did finally make the soccer team and it was a dream come true. Academically, in high school, most classes changed from G.T., to AP (Advanced Placement). I did fairly well my freshmen year and received the Lighthouse Recipient Award, chosen by my AP Human Geography teacher. Students were chosen as Lighthouse Recipients because teachers believed they had the potential to become great people and were role models to other students. At the end of my freshmen year, my parents began their divorce, which managed to distract me some during my sophomore and junior years, but not enough to knock off of my path. Along the way in High School, I was named an NSHSS (National Society for High School Scholars) Scholar. My Junior year I finally made my schools Varsity Soccer Team, which was one of my ultimate goals since elementary school. Since I was in middle school, I knew that Texas A&M University was where I would go to study for and become a Mechanical Engineer. During my Junior year in high school, I took an Architecture course, and an Engineering course. Then, during my Senior year, I took a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) course, that actually took place at another building a few miles from my actual high school. This course was extremely fun and educational and helped reinforce my decision to become an Engineer. My Senior year, I also became a teachers assistant for the Engineering course I took my Junior Year. I would like to say that my Senior year in high school was my most successful, considering I graduated in the top 5% of my class of 422, I was named Captain of the Varsity Soccer team, I received the Lighthouse Recipient Award again, from Soccer Coach, and I was awarded a trophy for being named in the First-Team All-District for soccer, and was accepted into the University of my dreams. High school was a great success for me, but now I am moving on to the next stage of my life. I am now 18 and have just started my first week at Texas A&M University. When I attended FISH Camp I was completely taken in awe by how amazingly nice and helpful students are from A&M. This Campus is extremely welcoming and amazing, and I absolutely love it, as well as the students and staff. A few days ago, I received an e-mail, notifying me of how much I will owe for the semester. I was taken a bit by surprise, because I was expecting a little less, but the amount for my first Semester is $4,048.49. I would honestly be more than willing to get a job, but the simple fact that I was not born here and dont have a Social Security Number, doesnt allow me to. Now, I would plan on asking my dad to help me pay for school, but as of now, he is overwhelmed with paying my rent, helping me with everyday expenses, and of course paying all the bills at home, including caring after my two younger sisters at home who are in high school and middle school. My last resort was to take out student loans, but one obstacle I was not prepared for, was lenders telling me that I simply do not qualify for any kind of loans, merely because I am not a citizen. This was something I had not seen coming, and for a moment it swept my feet from under me. For the past few days I have been sad, confused, disheartened, but also motivated. The thing is, if theres one thing I have learned from all the things life has thrown at me in my eighteen years of life, its that theres always a way. Its not always easy to put yourself out there and ask others for help, but I am determined to find a way. One good thing, is that I dont have to pay it all at once. I have the opportunity of paying $1,015.87 by September 9th, so that is my first goal. Whether I reach it or not is not my concern right now. My concern is finding more and more ways to get there, but I will not give up. Some people may read this and not have money to donate, but there is always a prayer you can offer. Prayers offer answers, and answers are also something I am in search of right now. No matter the amount you are willing to donate, it is simply money I did not have before, and it makes me one step closer to reaching my goal. For those of you who have graduated from a college or university already, you should know how essential and beneficial it is to finish school and have a degree. I have worked for this too long and I am in no way, shape or form giving up, and I hope you can help me through the process.\\n#GFMScholarship\\n\\n\\nThank you, and God bless!'),\n",

       "  'To whom it may concern, My name is Dwayne Peterkin II. I am preparing to enter my junior year at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I intend on majoring in Communications with a minor in Anthropology. After graduation I have set my sights on establishing a career within in the intelligence community. This encompasses agencies such as the CIA, FBI, and others that aid in maintaining the security of our country. I have also given heavy consideration into developing a career in the field of public relations and marketing. During these undergraduate years I desire to take advantage of the various offerings available at the university. Among these offerings is the opportunity to study abroad. I would ideally like to study abroad during the summer of 2016. This is the reason I am contacting you today. Before delving to deeply into that matter I would like to give you some background information about myself. I was born to a single mother in the inner city of Baltimore, MD. In spite of having a relationship with my father, he has been absent in aiding my mother in financially supporting me. At the age of five I was offered the opportunity to attend a private school, and continued private education for the entirety of my academic career. My mother began to make sacrifices to pay my tuition and allow me to receive the best education possible so that I could succeed in life. This decision set me on the path to where I am today. Among the opportunities afforded to me the most prominent was being able travel to Hawaii and participate in the Student Global Leadership Institute. This program selects a group of students from each school connected with the program. Those chosen come from various countries and are placed in an environment where they learn about and attempt to solve global issues. At the end of the program each school makes a plan and gives a presentation about a project they plan to institute the following academic year at their respective school. The selection process involved writing an essay and also being interviewed by the headmaster of our school and the program liaison employed at our school. My application was submitted to be compared with those of many others in my class. Finally after a period of a few weeks I was notified that I was accepted into the program. This experience helped shape my opinion of the world around me and allowed me to for friendships around the world with others who seek to make an impact on a global scale. It also furthered my desire to study abroad one day after meeting the other students from various countries across the world.  I am contacting you in hopes of sparking your interest in making an investment in my future. As I stated previously I have gone through a process akin to the selection process for the universitys study abroad program. My aspiration to travel abroad is a very tangible goal. My mother has sacrificed quite a lot to get me to this point in my education and asking her to assist in gathering finances so that I can study abroad would be asking far too much. I have chosen to be proactive in my approach to the financial situation at hand. I have devised a plan to approach cover the expenses of this endeavor. However any donation is appreciated.  Sincerely,                     Dwayne Peterkin II'),\n",

I took that picturealmost a year ago as we waited in line hand and hand, ready to walk across the stage ofthe UC Berkeley RAZA Graduation Ceremony. Moments later, I had the privilege of sharingthat stage and that accomplishment with the oneperson I have always sought to make proud-my little human being.I stand before you today, a first-generation, high school and college graduate who weeks ago was accepted to Harvard's Graduate School of Education. Although I am both excited and honored to have this opportunity, I am also overwhelmed by the overall cost of attending HGSE. Tuition alone is $43,280, plus an additional $3,432 in medical fees.The entire projected cost of attending Harvard comes out to a whooping $70,744.00, however this estimate is of that of a single (meaning no dependents) masters students. I am pleased to say that Harvard has awarded me a modest amount of $14,000 to help cover some of the tuition costs, nonetheless that is not nearly enough to cover school fees nor living expenses. So here is where I turn to the kindness of others...As I move forward with my academic endeavors, I realize that my lived experiences as a low-income, first generation, teen mom, student of color that have taught me just as much, if not more, than anything I could have ever learned in the classroom. It is these key experiences that keep me grounded and inform my pedagogical approach to education. Education can, and at times does, function as a liberatory tool of empowerment that enables consciousness; that initial spark. My refusal to accept education as anything less than freedom, encourages me to pursue a life dedicated to education. Moreover, it is the countless mentors, my brothers, and my beautiful daughter that have given me the courage to pursue an advanced degree, starting with my Ed.M. and resulting in a Ph.D.in Education Policy,so that I too can spark the minds that will change this world.As a single mother and the sole financial provider for my daughter, I am starting this campaign in hopes that you can help in making this dream come true for her and I. I am more than happy to share more about my story, or answer anyquestions if it will help shed light on my situation.Thank you for your support in advance!To learn more about our story please follow the links below:Univision-Madre soltera logra sueo de estudiar en Harvard con su hija como inspiracin PEOPLE'S Magazine-California Woman Goes from Teen Mom to Harvard: 'My Motivation Was a Walking and Living Thing'\"),\n",

       "  \"This is Yassmeen Castanada's story ... ..On Thanksgiving Yaasmeen was feeling ill. Common cold, sorethroat. A friend offered her an antibiotic pill that her friend had from a previous illness. She was thinking that it would help her, but this would be the biggest mistake of her life. After taking the pill , Yaasmeen started experiencing burning in her throat, eyes and mouth. As the night went by, her eyes became blood shot red and the lining of her lips was already torn off. I rushed her to the ER . The dr's immediately diagnosed her with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Something I've never heard about. Immediately I googled Stevens Johnson's and I began to panic. In my mind I knew this couldn't happen to my baby, but deep down in the pit of my stomach was a terrible, terrible feeling. Within 4 days Yaasmeen's appearance was transformed. I watched my daughter's skin burn, blister, bubble, n peel off and there was nothing I could do about it. The pain and agony she was going through just tore my heart to pieces. She was transferred to UCIrvine's burn unit. On December 5th she has surgery to scrape the top portion of her body. She was wrapped in biobrane. 2days later the bottom portion of her body was scraped. As you can see in the photo, she was wrapped in bandages from hed to toe. My daughter was intubated so she couldn't communicate with me. i made sure i prayed over her daily, I spoke to her daily and reminded her that she had a daughter that loved her very much. Everyday i told her to fight for her life. Yaasmeens blood was infected and she has had 5 blood trasfusions. As we got closer to recovery, she had a set back. She was having a hard time breathing. After multiple exams of her trachea, they noticed her airway was closing so she had an emergency tracheotomy. she had her trach for 6months. There have been times where she had trouble breathing. She had another surgery in april to open her airway because it closed and the steriod injections didn't work. On my birthday June 18th she had surgery to reconstruct her trachea. She was able to sing happy birthday to me as soon as the anesthesia wore off. Best gift ever! Today 6/25 Yaasmeen had her stitches removed. Yay! Her left eye is very damaged, she will need a cornea transplant. Hopefully in 6-8 months when she is healthier we can face that surgery. As for now, she will just work on getting healthier and spending a lot of time with her daughter Khloe and return to CSULA! This whole expierence has taught me to never take my children for granted. I almost lost my daughter to 1 pill! She never smoke or drank, she is a good kid that was on the right path. I just can't understand why this happened the way it did. But we will not dwell in the past, She has goals and a bright future ahead of her. I thank all of you for your love, support and prayers for my daughter. *Please be careful with medications because an allergic reaction can happen to anyone. #prayforyaas\"),\n",

       "  'Cancer? That is not the diagnosis I wanted to hear post surgery that removed a 15cm mass from my abdomen but on 11/29 that was the pathology report & diagnosis that forever changed my life. Now at the age of 41 with my hubby of 12 years, Bryan and the loves of my life, Keira (10) and Isaac (8), I am about to embark on a life-saving adventure. We have an amazing network of wonderful people who love, encourage and support us that keep asking what they can do?To be able to beat cancer I will be using traditional and naturopathic treatments. We will have to drive 2 hours to Billings, MT every time I need treatment which will be additional expenses. At some point, I may need to travel out of state for future treatments. Bryan and I have both been off work the last two weeks and need to figure out how we will proceed. All money raised from this campaign will be used for living expenses, treatments not covered by insurance, all out of pocket treatment expenses and necessary travel expenses to Billings, MT and beyond.Looking for the background? I had noticed bloating and an occasional pain and decided I should go get it checked out. On Thursday 11/10/16 I met with my primary care doctor and she ordered an ultrasound. I was able to get in the next day, so Friday 11/11/16 I had a late afternoon ultrasound. It was the weekend now so it was time to wait. Monday 11/14/16 I received a call from my primary care doctor and was notified of a large, complex, cystic mass spanning my abdomen and was given an urgent referral to Gynecology. Given my moms death from Ovarian Cancer, they wanted me to get a CA125 blood test. I left work and did the blood test right away. By that evening, I received a call from Bozeman Womens Health that my CA125 was elevated. Given the blood test results, the abdominal mass, the abnormal pap and my health history, I was referred to a Gynecologic Oncologist in Billings, MT to investigate this further. I was able to see them on Wed 11/16/16. He ordered a CT scan and got back to us immediately. On our ride home, we were informed that the CT scan showed about a mass 15cm in diameter and that he thought the best option was to continue with the surgery we had scheduled for Tuesday 11/22/16. He said he would be pleasantly surprised if it wasnt cancer. On 11/22/16 at 4:30 am, Bryan, myself and my best friend Michelle started our drive to Billings, MT (approx 2 hours away from our home in Bozeman). The surgery lasted about 6 hours (much longer than anticipated). During the surgery, in addition to a full hysterectomy, I had my appendix, two segments of my colon and some lymph nodes removed. The surgeon said he removed all visible signs of cancer, for which I am extremely grateful! They also inserted two ports to be used for later treatments. One is on the right side on my chest, just below my shoulder. The other is on the left side of my abdomen just below my rib cage.I had several minor setbacks while in the hospital including low blood pressure issues. They also thought I had a blood clot in my lungs, but it turned out to be fluid in my lungs. I had a procedure to drain the fluid. Then I had issues with a racing heartbeat which required additional testing. Testing revealed that I had fluid in my abdomen which required another procedure to drain the fluid.Right now I have an incision that runs approx. 16 vertically through my abdomen which you can imagine makes everything very difficult. I will have a 4-6 week recovery time post surgery. Not sure when we will start treatment, but Ill keep everyone posted. After a 9 days in the hospital, I am now resting and recovering at home, which has not been easy. So far I have managed to stay positive and keep my spirits lifted. Telling the kids today that the doctor found cancer cells was the most heartbreaking and horrible experience I have had, but I know we will get through this together! I was 30 years old when my mom died and it was brutal. I do not want my kids to experience the same thing! What scares me is not being able to see my kids grow up, but this is a battle I will not lose! My goal is to get my body to optimal health and do whatever is necessary to live a long life with my kids and Bryan.My husband Bryan (my third child) has my back. He said since I carried the family the first 12 years (we celebrated our anniversary in the hospital), that it would be an honor to support and care for me during this next adventure. He has been wonderful through this process; enduring long nights in the hospital, drives to and from Billings, MT, taking care of the kids, helping with medication management and so much more. I am extremely blessed to have amazing family, friends and acquaintances that lifted me up in love and prayers! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!Every dollar helps!

       "  'Our baby, Laurel Pearl Bares, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive pediatric cancer called Neuroblastoma on March 16, 2017. How did this happen? Laurel began acting extremely fussy and lost interest inher favorite foods in February2017. Although she was just learning to walk, she appeared unsteady and clumsy. We voiced our concerns to our pediatrician - multiple times via visits and phone calls, who just assured us it was normal behavior. Call it mother\\'s intuition, it just felt like something was very wrong. Fourdays after her first birthday on March 6, 2017, we took her for her 1 year checkup. She received vaccinations and was weighed - it was then we learned she was only in the 22% percentile for weight.As soon as Laurel receivedhervaccinations, shebecame very sick, and refused to eat or drink and began throwing up. I rushedher to the ER on March 13, 2017 for what Ibelieved would be for a bag of fluids. Upon seeing Laurel, the doctors asked that we ridevia ambulance to Children\\'s Hospital Boston. It was there that the doctor\\'s foundher blood pressure to be unusually high. And a mass was discovered in her abdomen.Hearing the word \"mass\" and understanding how serious this situation was, Brad and I felt helpless. Everything at that point accelerated, both in actual time and within ourselves. The team placed Laurel in the ICU for further testing.The tumor in Laurel\\'s abdomen measured the size of a large softball - about 8 cm wide. After it was biopsied, we learned that Laurel had Neuroblastoma. It was advanced as it had spread to her hips and was in 5% of her bone marrow. She was categorized to have MYCN amplified, high risk Stage IV Neuroblastoma.Since March, Laurel has undergone 5 rounds of high potency Chemotherapy. Each round lasted 21 days and became progressively stronger. Her tumor was resected in June and the surgeon believed he removed almost 99% of the mass.Sadly, in preparing for the next stage of treatment, Stem Cell Therapy, it was discovered by a nuclear scan on July 14th, 2017, that Laurel\\'s cancer has spread to both hips, her entire spinal column, jaw, and left side of her skull. Our doctor will not proceed with Stem Cell Therapy and explained that chemotherapy can have no effect on 10-15% of high-risk Neuroblastoma cases. It was explained that our future is grim, that the disease has advanced more than expected, and only a few therapies are left for Laurel.Laurel is considered to haverelapsed; however, we willnevergive up hope that she can be cured.At this point, we\\'ve explored all treatment options and are moving forward with a promising trial calledch.14/18IT Treatment with Irinotecan and Temodar. The chemotherapy/immunotherapy drug combination has been used in trials for about 5 years for kids with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma. It is not yet approved by the FDA. When ch14.18 attaches to Neuroblastoma cells, the body\\'s immune system is stimulated to attack and kill the Neuroblastoma cells. Laurel will begin this treatment on July 24th.Because the future remains unknown, we hope this fund with provide some financial padding if we decideto travel to another hospital for more experimental treatment.Brad has used up his earned time working at the hospital and we want to enjoy being with Laurel as much as possible now. Pray for Laurel. Kick and fight and heal for Laurel.

Our innocent neighbor Craig Sandoval was in his garage getting parts to fix a shelf inside while his wife Marie was making nachos and wings for the game. Marie came outside to get Craig because the nachos were getting soggy and they happened to see the robbers in the alley in a box truck loading our belongings up without realizing fully what was happening. The robbers pointed a sawed off shot gun at both of them and threatened to shoot them. Craig told them to get out ofthere and one of the robbers shot him twice. He was hit in the arm and the stomach with the shotgun at close range. Luckily, Marie was not hit, nor was her son who had just arrived to watch the game with his family.Craig has had health issues his whole life requiring many surgeries. The wound to his stomach hit prior internal wounds and went through his stomach and intestines. 8 hours of surgery later, they have been able to get all of the pellets out of his stomach area but have had to do quite extensive work on his internal organs to keep them safe. His stomach wound remains open until the swelling is down to prevent infection.Craig's arm was hit as well, and was broken in two places by the bullets. It is currently in a splint and he will go back into surgery today so they can double check that all the pellets have been removed in order to prevent a blood infection that can go to his heart and kill him.Obviously the medical bills will be quite extensive and while Craig has insurance, it will not be enough to cover it. Many people within our network have asked how they can help and this is the best way. Craig will be out of work for a minimum of 6 months now and he is the sole provider for their family. We will be helping them pay their day to day bills as well with personal funds.Craig is a wonderful neighbor, always watching out for us, giving us food from his garden, and being a really good guy.

Follow Fifis progress on  https://www.facebook.com/groups/fifisway/Philip is 3 years old, and was enjoying a normal, healthy life until a tragic car accident on 11/17/16 resulting in multiple injuries, including traumatic brain injury, anoxic brain damage, C2 fracture, spastic quadriparesis, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation. The accident happened while my wife, Anna, got front-ended by a 3rd party while on the way to the preschool. The person who caused the accident is still under investigation.After two months of ICU hospitalization at Loyola, two months in-patient rehab at the Ability Lab (formerly Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago  RIC), and followed by outpatient rehabilitation, Philip is currently receiving his rehabilitation services through a school for children with special needs, which he recently begun. Hes also enrolled in a home therapy program done by parents and overseen by NACD (The National Association for Child Development), and receives speech therapy by Arlington Pediatric Therapy.Although doctors gave us the grimmest prognosis, Philip shows us every day that he is fighting and not giving up. From the start we saw that he is responding to his family, and we knew we needed to make sure he has our undivided support. We work with him every day in therapy and at home. He was successfully weaned off a respirator (and breaths independently through trache); he is reacting to his family, making cautious choices with his eyes and through use of a micro light switch, has a controlled use of his tone, and limited movements with his hands and legs. He\\'s tolerating sitting and standing, and started some very assisted walking in a pediatric walker!We know that our fight does not end here, as it is a marathon not a race. Luckily, we have Philips cord blood banked exactly so we could use it this hour of his greatest need, and this is it. Stem cells have an enormous medical potential, and todays medicine is making a lot of progress exploring their use for various conditions, including TBI.We have conducted so much research and explored all possible avenues of treatment for Philip in the United States and Canada, and although many clinics and hospitals were very interested in his case (due to the fact that not only he survived despite such great injuries, but he is also making progress) and eager to offer advice, in the end the answer was always the same We are so sorry ... we cant help. We couldnt take no for an answer. We looked further and explored the possibility of treatment in Europe, and eventually came across Dr. Dariusz Boruczkowski, Med. Dir. at the Polish Stem Cell Bank, (  https://www.pbkm.pl/en) who, after evaluating Philips case, decided to help us. Now, after a long assessment process, the Polish Stem Cells Bank started to work on the treatment for Philip which is administered by RegenMed, a neurological clinic in Cracow, Poland.  We are very hopeful about the treatment, as we know it is the only treatment available at this point that has such great potential to accelerate Philips recovery process and specifically to help repair and rebuild his brain allowing him to gain his functions back and thus giving him a chance, THE chance for recovery. The treatment will consist of a series of 5 to 10 procedures / stem cell injections into the lower parts of Philips spinal cord. Philip went through the initial procedure, which he tolerated very well, the following treatments are to be administered every 3 months. Now, the greatest obstacle on our way is to find the funding for the treatment itself and associated travel expenses. We estimated that we will need approximately $175,000 for the stem cell treatment, stem cell transportation, neurology and pediatric care, medical facility, nursing care, flights, lodging, as well as car / transportation needed to handle wheelchair and all the caregivers. Although we realize it is not an easy task to raise such amount of funds, we believe there is nothing insurmountable when it comes to our son. We will keep on moving forward and do all it takes so he has a chance at life.Thank you!Ania & LucasDrodzy Przyjaciele,Serdecznie prosimy o wsparcie i pomoc na leczenie dla naszego synka Filipka (Fifi).

Jestesmy pelni nadzieji, i pomimo ze wedlug neurologow Polskich wiekszy postep powinien byc widoczny dopiero po trzecim zabiegu, codziennie wypatrujemy jakis zmian. Jedyne co teraz stoi nam na drodze to sa koszta zwiazane z leczeniem.Wedug naszych wylicze bedziemy potrzebowac okoo $175.000 na transport i przeszczepy komrek macierzystych, opaty medyczne i lekarskie, opiek pielgniarsk, przeloty do Polski, zamieszkanie, oraz wynajem auta  transport dostosowany do obslugi wzka inwalidzkiego.Bdziemy bardzo wdziczni za jakkolwiek pomoc dla naszego synka Filipka.

She pulled books in close, got stuck on words. She was finallydiagnosed withBatten Disease,a rare fatal genetic condition that robs normal children of everything. They end up bedridden, on a feeding tube, with seizures, and cognitively impaired. There is no cure... yet.We were given no hope.

       "  \"On Monday October 12th, after a number of weeks of not feeling or acting like her normal effervescent self, our 38 years-young, non-smoking friend Lesley was admitted to the hospital. After a week long battery of tests, everyone's worst fears were realized when the diagnosis came back as an aggressive form of lung cancer, which had spread to various parts of her body including her brain. Further complicating matters, Lesley was then 30 weeks pregnant with their second child. On October 21st, Lesley had brain surgery to remove the two largest tumors in her left temporal lobe that have been causing her to struggle to find her words. With the first of her surgeries behind her, her team of oncology and obstetrics doctors have now turned their focus towards determining the best plan for chemotherapy and radiation treatment while balancing the health and well-being of their growing baby, who thankfully does not appear to be negatively impacted by any of the tumult going on within Lesley's body.This fund is intended to help offset what will turn out to be a very costly battle against Lesley's cancer. In a world where insurance coverage exceptions and high deductibles can bankrupt families, we want to help cover the cost of whatever we can, from childcare to trips to the hospital, that will allow Lesley and Chris to focus 100% of their energy on getting her better. Whether you know Lesley from Rhode Island, Chicago, London, Babson, soccer teams, work, or the number of countless other ways she's touched our lives, you know that Lesley always goes out of her way to put a smile on your face. We've created this fund so that Lesley and her family can focus on her health to ensure we, along with her children, will be seeing that smile for decades to come. Since being admitted on the 12th, Lesley has remained in the hospital surrounded by her loving and supportive husband Chris, her parents and siblings, and a number of other family and close friends have been visiting from far and wide. Lesley and Chris' 2-year old son Lachlan gets to Skype with mom before bed and is blissfully unaware of what's going on, relishing the extra love and attention from having so many friends and family around.

       "  \"On Friday, May 13th, 2016, 46-year old, Michelle Tran, was trying to go through another day as a single mother. Typically, she is an energetic and upbeat person, able to handle all sorts of work-related and parental pressures; a supermom in all respects. Michelle was buying supplies for her Kale Drink product line, dealing with new customer contracts, thinking about preparing her 7-year old daughter, Qiana, for after-school dance and music classes. However, she was not able to finish her busy day as planned. In fact, in the middle of all that activity her body failed her.By the end of that Friday, Michelle was rushed to Hoag Memorial Emergency due to several fainting episodes, severe headaches, and back pain throughout the afternoon. The initial MRIs of her head and torso revealed that there were approximately 2.0 cm growths on her brain stem and lower lumbar spinal cord. The on-call neurologist immediately performed brain surgery to implant a VP shunt to relieve the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) accumulating in Michelles head due to the growth at the brain stem. This was a life-saving operation according to the neurologist, done at the nick of time. Any further delay would have resulted in organ shutdown and death, probably within 24 hours, as the brain became more and more damaged with the increased inter-cranial pressure.Michelles work ethic and devotion to her daughter is much admired by her many friends, colleagues, and of course family. Shes been intimately involved with the fast-paced Vietnamese entertainment industry in Orange County, CA, for decades and is probably the reason why her daily personal rhythm is just as fast paced. It is such a shock to witness Michelles current condition, not only with regards to the seriousness of the MRI findings, but how totally incapacitated Michelle became overnight. In fact, if it were not for Luu Bich, Michelles close friend, insisting to go to the emergency room, Michelle would have soldiered on through her pain per her normal personality.It has now been several weeks since the initial surgery that saved her life. The growths have been confirmed to be malignant, but a final determination of the type of cancer cell is in dispute within the Hoag Cancer Board. The lesion on the brain stem is inoperable; and the lesions on the spinal cord have been observed to be spreading. Treatment plans are not finalized until the cancer cell type is concluded. It is assumed that there will be a combination of low yield radiation and chemotherapy. The family hopes to find alternatives through clinical trial drugs that may have better tolerated side effects. In addition to the physical and emotional toll due to the cancer, Michelle has had to close down her existing business and stop all contract discussions. Her apartment had to be vacated, her belongings stored, since she requires 24/7 assisted care. Her daughter, Qiana, is carefully being taken care of by the extended family, but misses her mom. It was only a week after her 7th birthday that Michelle began to get critically ill. On top of the substantial medical bills after almost a month of hospitalization, Michelle has lost her ability to generate income. Her family and friends at Paris by Night (Thy Nga Productions) and Little Chopin Music School are establishing this GoFundMe account to show their love and support for Michelle and Qiana, a mother and daughter team who mean so much to all of us. No donation is too small; hopefully we can fix the financial burden to a significant degree that it is one less thing that Michelle has to worry about. We want her to enjoy quality time with her daughter as much as she can.Marie To & Paul Huynh - Thuy Nga ProductionsMichelle & friends.

Any part of the heart can be affected, though these cell clusters most often form in the heart muscle where they can interfere with the hearts electrical system (conduction defects) and cause irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). Cardiac sarcoidosis can also result in heart failure. A little over a year ago Tom had aImplantable Cardioverter Defibrillator installed to help with the arrhythmias.

EB is a skin disease that makes your skin very fragile. So fragile infact it can simply peel or rub off because of the slightess friction. Even clothes can be to harsh at times, the caress and embrace of his parents could actually create enough friction to cause painful blisters that fill with fluid and burst leaving raw unprotected sores, leaving him susceptible to many infections. There is no cure for EB. The only treatment is pain management and bandaging. The pain management and bandages will be needed for life, in fact depending on the type of EB some patients only have a life expectancy of 25 years of age. Kahleel is currently awaiting biopsy results to determine the type he has but already in his short life he has endured so much suffering and pain. His father is an active member of the US Navy stationed in Bremerton, WA.

LEAP will be working in 3 of these camps this summer.Need: In continuing the mission of ensuring dental healthcare to residents of the camps, and as a response to the ever increasing numbers within these camps, in particular considering the arrival of large numbers of Syrian and Palestinian refugees from Syria, BAS has requested additional support in expanding their outreach in the field of oral healthcare.

However, worldwide, taking care of one\\'s teeth is often considered with less urgency than other health matters. Poor dental care habits can allow harmful bacteria to attack the gums and teeth resulting in gum disease and tooth decay. Moreover, if left untreated, there are increased risks of other illnesses affecting parts of the body. For example, gum disease can lead to bacteria moving into the bloodstream, causing infection. Such risks can be reduced and eliminated with good dental practices. Barriers to good oral hygiene are more prevalent in less affluent communities and include limited access to and availability of dental services, a lack of awareness about the need for care, cost and fear of dental procedures. The dental clinics established through BAS in refugee camps in Lebanon aim to remove these barriers, so that residents may have an increased opportunity at better dental health.Composite filling materials (frontal) Composite filling materials (posterior) Bonding for composite Itching gel for composite Composite finishing rubber Composite finishing burs Composite finishing gel Assorted diamond burs for cavity preparation Carboxylate cement Glass lonomer luting cement Root canal filling material Anesthesia Amp. 2% Impression materials Instruments Hand piece \"turbine fiber optic\" Light cure \"for composite filling\"We appreciate your help and support.Website:  http://www.leap-program.orgEmail: info@leap-program.org'),\n",

Our approach allows us to address both the immediate needs of our youth while empowering them to work for systemic social change that will provide long-term benefits for the entire community. History and Past Accomplishments VAYLA serves Vietnamese, Latino, and African American youth through engaging their families to holistically address the issues and barriers they face, developing plans that help them meet their goals. As previously mentioned, we offer multiple services that focus on their education, health, and their leadership while fostering the development of relationships with a network of caring adults to further support them. For parents and guardians, we offer ESL, GED, and civic engagement classes that help them tap into a broader range of resources for their families. Through our work we have successfully served over 1,000 youth annually.  Evidence in how we have been able to shape the lives of young people can be underscore by the following examples of evidence-based practices: Raise Your Hand Campaign, Family Circle, and the Villages of the East Coalition. Goals and Strategies - Provide opportunities for families and individuals to learn, grow, develop, and become self-sufficient, productive citizens.- Provide effective advocacy services to families and individuals to empower them to advocate for themselves and actively engage and participate in community and society.- Provide social support services to families and individuals by promoting education, health, leadership, cultural, and generational connections.- Develop VAYLA to become a resource center where families and individuals can get the information they need to make effective decisions.Needs and Opportunities In the past few years, VAYLA has grown from a small staff of 4 to a team of 14.

When left unchecked, combat related traumatic experiences often lead a person down a path of sadness, depression, loneliness, despair and frequently, suicide.   The sad and devastating truth of today is that military suicide rates have risen to a disturbing level of approximately 8,000 service members and veterans per year- or 22 deaths per day. This is unacceptable to me. Often these tragic losses are due in part to a sickening lack of outreach, attention, and care that certain entities are charged with providing to our veterans. Even worse, these entities are funded by American tax dollars, yet the services they offer are minimal. (And untimely)There is obviously a problem. Whether you agree with the recent wars or not, veterans (and their families) are suffering in our country. They need our help. Together, we can find solutions if we are willing to work toward them. I\\'m willing to do whatever I can. On Nov 8, 2015 I will snap on my running prosthesis and run the Pensacola Marathon in Pensacola, Fl to raise resources for local and surrounding veterans. Running a marathon with one leg will not be an easy task. But I\\'m willing to suffer for a few hours to help those who suffer daily.    I deeply believe that there is an effective therapeutic value in one veteran helping another. One of my missions is to create a \"hub\" where veterans who have learned a new way of life can guide struggling veterans through their hardships. This kind of work costs time and resources. So I am reaching out to you all. I have personally walked my own path through the difficult years after serving in war. I know its not easy. But I know what it takes to make it. Ihave found my way back to a life thatserves and inspires others. Today, I just want to share that with other veterens. I\\'m asking you to please help me do that.  I encourage everyone to donate what you can.No amount is too small.  All proceeds will go througha local Pensacola 501 C-3 non-profit named POE In Action (PeaceOn Earth). I am a board member of POE. If you would like to use a donation for a tax write-off please contact me at ejames11@ymail.com.  Any funds collected will be used for directly assisting veterans by: paying for effective, immediate emergency crisis counseling that governmentveterans\\' servicesdon\\'t provide in time, helping relieve veterans\\'financial crises, employment consulting, temporary housing for homeless veterans, direct and close support with military to civilian transitioning, peer mentorship, and anything else the veteran needs to bring about a permenant life change. (Not a temporary bandaid).  If you would like to learn more about our non-profit or donate to us directly, again, I welcome you to contact me: ejames11@ymail.comIf we want suicide rates among veterans to drop, then veterans\\' issues need to stop being swept under the rug. We as a society need to step up and clean our side of the street by learning what we can do to adapt to the veteran as they learn to re-adapt to civilian life.  If you have ever read about the problems that veterans are facing today and have thought to yourself \"what can I do to help?\"- this would be a great place to start.  Thanks, EJ'),\n",

       "  \"On October 7th 2016, Hurricane Matthew passed through the small community of New Smryna Beach, Florida. The 130 mph winds tore through the town destroying buildings and downing trees. The normally quiet backwater creeks surrounding the town poured over into the streets as the storm headed NNW leaving devastation in its path. Marine Discovery Center, a popular 501C3 nonprofit in the area that focuses on environmental education and outreach had planned well for the storm. The beloved tour boat, The Discovery, was dry docked in Ponce Inlet while all of the tour kayaks were lifted off of their creek side stands and brought inside the building. The FWC boat, used to survey flora and fauna in the area, was tucked away beside the kayaks and other possessions needing extra protection from the storm. The staff spent hours on Tuesday and Wednesday setting all of the aquariums to run on generators for when the power went out, covering electronics and important papers in plastic sheeting, and making sure everything was tied down, tucked away, and safe from the storm. The staff left to take care of their own homes, not knowing what they would come back to next week. The Artists' Workshop, another community driven 501C3 non-profit, shares the building with The Marine Discovery Center and has been offering art education since 1957 in New Smyrna Beach. The Artists' Workshop has long served the community by conducting art education classes for adults and well as youth including a very successful summer art camp for children. There are close to 350 members as well as numerous nonmembers who take classes in all forms of art instruction as well as workshops presented by visiting artists from other areas of the country.  After Matthew subsided, and people started returning to town, Marine Discovery Center and Artist Workshop staff discovered that their building had not fared as well as they had hoped despite their careful consideration when preparing for the storm. The building, site of an old high school, was missing more than half of its roof which lay in pieces and sheets on the ground. Much of the building suffered water damage, especially in the Marine Discovery Centers classroom, education staff office, and the gift shop. Staff and volunteers spent their weekend mopping up water, caring for the aquariums, and temporarily putting a tarp over the gaping holes in the roof weighed down with pieces of rubble. The Artist Workshop has been forced to cancel classes and workshops until the new roof can be installed due to water damage in four studios, their kitchen, and a library which houses several hundred art books.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimates show that the entire roof will need to be replaced to the tune of $150,000 and unfortunately insurance will not cover it. 10,000 square feet of roof will need to be replaced, and a donation of as little as $15 can help us repair one square foot of roof space. We are hopeful that you will help us reach our goal so we can replace our roof and continue serving our community as a leader in environmental education and outreach.Please consider donating today!\"),\n",

I worked as a public high school teacher for 15 years and loved it, but an injury on the job has left me unable to work. I am now at the point where I may soon be forced to move away from my sons, and it breaks my heart.In May 2007 an extremely brutal fight broke out in my classroom, and when I attempted to intervene , among other injuries, one of the two students picked me up and threw me across the room to the floor. Officers came in shortly after and took the students out of the room, and I thought I was fine, though definitely banged up a bit. I went home and rested that night, but the next morning I took two steps and hit the floor: I was in unbearable pain and unable to walk. The young man had crushed three discs in my spine. A little over two and a half years and 13 procedures later ended with having an \"Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion\" - a fancy way of saying that I have rods, screws, titanium cages, and cadaver implants in my lower spine. It was so severe that the surgeons had to go in through my abdomen from the front, lay my organs outside my body, and literally hammer and chisel out the damaged material from the inner part of my back. I was on medical leave for almost 8 months. My surgeon was phenomenal, and I can walk now, but the damage was so severe that I have permanent nerve damage in my lower back and left leg. I am always in pain, though the level varies. After continuing to work for 7 years after the initial injury, I have reached a point where I can not stand for any length of time, cannot walk long distances, cannot sit for any length of time, and can\\'t even sleep much - as whenever I move the slightest bit to get comfortable, I feel a nerve pinch and am awakened by the pain. I simply can\\'t find a position that doesn\\'t hurt.My spinal surgeon says that he\\'s done all he can do, and I will be in pain for the rest of my life. I didn\\'t sue the school - at the time, I thought it was best for my students not to take more funds from a county that was already faltering (typical teacher, I guess, thinking of the students first). Besides, the county agreed to cover initial medical fees and I got lots of \"We\\'ll take care of you\" sentiments, though none in writing. Since I waited over two years, I can no longer make a claim.As if that weren\\'t enough, in 2010 I had the first of 15 eye surgeries for a bizarre series of retinal detachments in both eyes. I am now completely blind in my right eye, though an excellent retinal surgeon has helped me maintain almost 20/40 vision in my left eye.I am thankful and grateful to still have as much vision and mobility as I do, but the fact is my level of pain and lack of mobility has left me unable to work. I filed for disability, which I\\'m told I will eventually receive, but it has been over 17 months and my retirement savings, as small as it was, has been completely used. I am at imminent risk of becoming homeless, I have unpaid medical bills for my vision, have no insurance, and will be unable to support my children in less than a month. I found out last week that my disability hearing is at least 14 months away!I may be asking for too little, to be honest: my goal is to be able to pay rent and utilities for at least a few months. I resisted coming to Go Fund Me for a long time, because I\\'m so used to pulling my own weight, but I\\'m no longer in a position to do so. I have gotten to a point where I\\'m desperate for help.

Unfortunately, that day has not yet come, although we still remain convinced there must be a pony in the towering pile of poop.\\n\\n\\nWhen last you heard from us, we were just about to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure on our house...and that happened!! Yea!! And so for the last few months we have been (just barely and with help) making those payments, our first mortgage payments, and our other bills. We cut our expenses, including giving up Tony's studio space. I continued to look for a job, and we put our efforts into running Tinplate Studios as well.\\n\\n\\nThen...the darkness came...or more specifically January and...job prospects withered and died and the business tanked. I blame That Man...you know the one. And we need to make our bankruptcy payment next week, and the coffers are empty.\\n\\n\\nNow...as I said...all is not lost...not absolutely...not yet. I have two jobs circling out there that I really truly believe are close to offers *and* we have our biggest show coming up in two weeks - Emerald City Comicon. Finding enough money to buy supplies for that is, unfortunately, an issue as well.\\n\\n\\nSo here we are again. On your doorstep, hats in hand, asking for help. We understand this is not a sustainable lifestyle choice...to keep doing this. We are already looking into selling the house - a tricky prospect while in bankruptcy, but must find a way to survive just a bit longer to give that a chance to succeed as well.\\n\\n\\nAs you well know...we have stuff for sale!\\n\\n\\nThere are many fun new things up on  www.tinplatestudios.etsy.com\\n\\nThere are also starting to be things up on my Etsy shop -  www.dejaviews.etsy.com\\n\\nNothing in our house (vintage collectibles! steamy costume bits! shop fixtures and housewares!) is safe from a priced-to-sell-tag and we'll try to get those up on Facebook first just as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\nWe are humbled and grateful for your support.

(That's where the initial $4,885 went...and why it says we want such a big honking number - we're trying to raise $5,000 now.) I got some temporary contract work, we did a few shows for Tonys business, Tinplate Studios, and we squeaked along until now. What we were not able to do was make a couple of past due payments on our second mortgage, and the mortgage holder, Washington State Employees Credit Union (WSECU), is now foreclosing on our house. The foreclosure sale is set for September 9th, in less than 2 weeks.\\n\\nWeve been working with the Urban League for the last several months to try and negotiate some sort of modification with WSECU, but they have been unwilling to do so. Because they are a credit union, they are not bound by law to do Foreclosure Mediation. Although they told us, in 2012, and again in 2015 that they had written off the loan, and did not seek payment from us during that time, we did start a reduced payment plan with them in late 2015, and we fell 2 -3 months behind on that. Were current on our 1st mortgage.\\n\\n\\nWSECU now appears to be willing to possibly consider making some arrangements that could postpone or forestall the sale of the house. They want money right away for their legal fees and towards our arrears, and then perhaps they would be willing to make arrangements for the balance. They want the money tomorrow. We dont have it. Its possible we may be able to negotiate a few more days.\\n\\nSowhat were hoping for is to raise enough money to buy us some time. We dont want to lose our home  I grew up in this house. My parents bought the house in 1947, and I raised my family, the third generation of Ravenna residents, in my childhood family home. I even wrote a book about the neighborhood, with a number of pictures of the house! \\n(Check out my Author Page .)\\n\\n\\nHeres a bit of background on us and our situation -\\n\\n\\nIf you've found your way here, you probably know us (or at least had a passing moment of thinking who are the dashing duo in the great hats?!)\\nbut you may not know our current situation. Myself (Ann Wendell) and my husband, Tony Hicks, are romantic/creative partners in adventure, living in our 100 year old house in the Ravenna neighborhood of Seattle. We met online about 13 years ago, and after falling madly, truly, deeply in love, decided we should meet. Tony came to visit me in Seattle and never left (as a native Seattleite, I was allowed to sponsor him...even though he's from California.) I'm an author, local historian, and recruiter/business researcher and Tony is an artist, creating sideshow gaffs and cryptozoological wonders, natural (and unnatural) illustrations and sequential art, disturbing jewelry, and Steampunk bodgery as Tinplate Studios . \\n\\nSo...here's the scoop. We've gotten ourselves into a bit of a pickle. We have woken up to smell the cat food in our bank account. We're broke...flat out busted...skint...tapped out...poor as church mice, as Job's turkey, as a cabdriver in Venice. How the heck did this happen?!?! Well, the last 2 years or so have been filled with our very own Series of Unfortunate Events (and frankly we were already in a pretty deep hole due to such fun life experiences as the aftermath of a messy divorce, unemployment, and cancer.) We were unprepared for the big blows - the unexpected loss of my job and Tony's diagnosis of Sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease. He was flat on his back for months, and I was taking care of him. Unfortunately, he is still not back to being completely healthy, and he struggles every day to have the energy and stamina to continue working. And thus began the cascading Dominos of Doom where part of your roof blows off, your 80 year old furnace needs repair (and somehow to be filled with oil before the cold hits), as does your car (which is how you get to shows where you could vend and make money...if you could...but you can't), the utilities and electricity still need to be paid, and even though my job search is in high gear, offers are just not pouring in.\\n\\n\\nWe are lucky to be covered for healthcare (Thanks Obama!!) so we still have a steady supply of antidepressants coming in. But we now face the prospect of literally having no place to live. This is how we would use the money were asking for now  staving off the foreclosure sale of our house. If you can help us keep a roof over our heads (even though it is now a large plastic tarp) for just a bit longer until we have steady money coming in, it would mean the world to us.\\n\\n\\nOther ways you can help -\\n\\n\\n1. Buy things from us! \\nTony's Etsy shop is  www.tinplatestudios.etsy.com . (It may be several weeks processing time, but he promises it'll be well worth the wait.)\\nAnn's Etsy shop is www.dejaviews.etsy.com (This will soon be filled with treasures such as vintage hats, clothes, jewelry cocktail sets, tea pots and salt and pepper shakers.) You can also buy Anns books from her directly (Images of America: Seattles Ravenna Neighborhood, and Images of America: Frederick & Nelson.)\\n\\n\\n2. Let Ann know about job leads! \\nHere's my LinkedIn profile to get an idea of what I can do -  www.linkedin.com/in/annwendell .\\n\\n\\n3.

       "  'To my Theta Xi brethrenLast week I had the honor to reconnect with pledge brother Aaron Garrett, BE 554. Aaron called to let me know that he had been in a car accident and wondered if he could have his car towed to my house. Of course, and thus was the beginning of 4 days underneath a car that had certainly seen better days. Aaron\\'s \\'94 Toyota Camry had bent/busted three rear suspension tie-rods, cracked his windshield, popped his hood and trunk out of alignment, banged up the rear quarter panel, and blew two air bags--which incidentally, knocked him back so hard that it broke his seat and must now be propped up. Needless to say, getting the tie rods out was going to be a bit of a chore, but the car really is toast. Oh, and by the way, I was at work most of the time, so he did most of the car work himself.After going to the local salvage yard (auto stores don\\'t carry this stuff for 22 year old cars), we managed to get the tie-rods and re-install the new/old parts. We were both pleased to find that the car was still drivable and that there were no other discernable problems. A day later I followed Aaron back down I-5 to his home in Davis and we parted ways.I cannot tell you what it has meant to get to spend so much time with an old friend. The real blessing, though, was talking about our lives and sharing what we had learned. Despite different experiences, the conclusions we discovered about this world are so similar.If you do not know, please let me share with you Aaron\\'s situation. Almost 30 years ago Aaron was in a horrible industrial accident, where he was basically crushed and barely survived. He has since spent the majority of his adult life on heavy pain medication and lives on disability payments. Our once hard-working, strong friend has quietly lived his life in immense pain and incredible humility. Aaron would never complain about his situation, nor ask for this help, but it is clear to me that he certainly could use a hand right now.Our conversations meandered about life, our past, God, and the place where each of us is in our life. I could clearly see that every waking moment was a struggle for him and am inspired by his humble perseverance. Imagine working underneath a car while your body is screaming to just maintain some semblence of normality.They really don\\'t make TX men any better. Not once a complaint, not a whine about his struggle, not a request for any kind of handout. \"It is what it is\", a phrase we both seemed to recite repeatedly. Aaron could easily be angry about his situation. Rage about how this life has been so unfair. Be miserable in the ridiculous amounts of pain meds he has to take--just to be able to get up in the morning. I quickly realized that his stay with me was a greater blessing to myself, than to him. I can help you fix your car, but I don\\'t believe I can inspire you to live a life in testament to God. I hope (and pray) that we will be able to rally around our brother and do something that will at least help him maintain his mobility. Aaron would never consider asking any of us for money, it\\'s just not his way. I do know that he is safe, has a place to live, and with his limited means, continues living a life of real honor. Any money donated will go to helping him buy a new car and living expenses.YITBTom Lowe, BE 555'),\n",

       "  \"My name is Carlo Bellario I am a professional stand up comedian/actor.. I am here on Go Fund Me today for assistance with a incident that occurred to me on November 16th of 2015.In between comedy gigs I sometimes take on acting roles. I joined a group on Facebook that posts casting calls. So I saw a post for a movie called Vendetta Games looking for henchman type bodyguards for a drug dealer. So I submitted for the role and got casted. I was to report to the set in Woodbridge N.J it was a small independant film produced by a college student. There was no pay but I was to receive a copy of the film & credit on IMDB... So the scene called for me and another guy to be in a simulated car chase scene and I was to be shooting at the car in front of me. So we filmed the scene in a residential area of Woodbridge, and as soon as we returned from the shooting the scene , the set was surrrounded by police cars. Apparently residents in the neighborhood phoned the police and told them that there was a two guys driving around waving a gun out of the window. Now I understand that residents did not realize we were shooting a movie and understand why the police were called, and I cannot fault the cops either due to the fact that they are getting a call and have no idea what the situaution is.When the police arrived we attempted to explain to them that this is a movie shoot, and that the gun was a prop. After several minutes of questioning everyone the police had determined that the producer & director neither had a film permit nor did they have a permit for the prop gun which turned out to be an air soft pellet pistol. I was the only one arrested that day for possesion of a handgun, and now face up to 5 years of prison,. I spent 4 days in jail at Middlesex County Jail until my family was able to post bond for me. The producer of the movie told my family that he would indeed bail me out but when he found out the bail was 10,000 he declined to help and left me there and left my family frantic as to how to arrange bail and get me released. He ignored my family's phone calls & subsequently my family had to lay out over 4,500 thus far for the bail bondsman and other expenses.So I am humbly asking that anyone who is in the entertainment industry, to please contribute as little as $1... I understand that this time is tough for everyone financially. But if you are unable to donate, please consider sharing it with others who you may feel can help, so i can accquire the necessary money to retain an attorney and to recoup what members of my family have given thus far, and the expenses incurred by the bailbondsman that have left me and my family financially distraughtAs actors we all want to work and get ourselves exposure but we also need to hold the industry to higher standard as well and serve as a valuable to not let what happened to me happen to other actors.I have several attorneys who want to help and see me through this situation but it will involve a lengthy legal process which will incure a huge amount of fees which I completely understand,.I am highly embarrassed that I am here asking for help like this but I am out of options and my friends, family, and peers are my last hope.If anyone knows of an attorney who is willing to take the case PRO BONO please contact me.Due to the nature of this charge I cannot leave the state or travel as I often do for my comedy gigs.Thank You for taking the time to read my story.THANKS & GOD BLESSCarlo Bellario\"),\n",

Each chair weighs over 300 pounds and they need a special vehicle that can be equipped to fit not only one chair but BOTH wheelchairs to get around. Recently Lucy and Hugo's WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VAN got STOLEN! They need the van to get to doctors' appointments and for Hugo to go to work! Using the CDT Paratransit service is not a reliable source for Hugo to get to work, since they're usually not on time, and this would make Hugo late for work on a regular basis. Using public transportation is difficult during the winter, since they get really cold and their muscles tense up. They already have bad circulation and the cold makes their hands stiff which makes it hard for them to drive their own chairs after a while. This can be dangerous when crossing the street to get to and from the train/bus stop. The family is in complete shock that their van was stolen. The van was specially converted to fit both wheelchairs by having the two middle seats and the passenger seat REMOVED. This is presumably a reason that the culprits stole the van due to the spacious interior to commit other illegal crimes. Whatever reason anyone had is completely inexcusable and WRONG, but now Hugo and Lucy are left stranded. These type of vans can easily cost $35,000+.The van was found by the police but it was completely burned. Hugo's Dad said it looked like they set off a bomb in the middle of it. The windows that didn't break were smashed in with bricks. It's crazy to think about. Hugo's Dad said he felt like crying when he saw it as he couldn't believe that people could be so cruel.Hugo and Lucy did nothing to deserve such a heinous thing to happen to them. They both have the kindest and generous souls you will ever meet. Please donate what you can to get Hugo and Lucy back to the independence they once had!Thank you, Moira\"),\n",

There may also be legal expenses. I thought if there was any extra cash, I would divide it up among these families if they in fact leave. Most of them have been here so long that they no longer have homes in the places where they came from.My plan for using the money is this: If I buy plane tickets, I will do so on line using my own accounts. If bills need to be paid , I will write checks, again from my own account. I will keep careful record of all the expenditures, that all donor will be welcome to examine.

Since then they have had to overcome MANY obstacles to re-build and get back into their home. They have moved four times, battled insurance companies, banks and even a contractor lawsuit.On November 15, 2016 they finally settled the lawsuit, their house was almost complete and ready for them to move in. Expected move in date was only days away. However on the morning of Wednesday December 7th a pipe under the kitchen sink broke flooding the whole main floor and their basement where they had just moved all their belongings. Things that had survived the fire and had been in storage were ruined. Needless to say they will not be moving in anytime soon, extensive damage to the main floor has to be gutted and redone.That brings us to today A day when they were supposed to be waking up in their house for the first time in almost two years is now a day of sorrow as this nightmare continues. Once again they find themselves taking pictures of damaged belonging, dealing with insurance companies and contractors all over again verse enjoying and preparing for this holiday season.We want nothing more for them to enjoy this holiday season, which also includes Dave and Angelas Birthdays. So we have stared a GoFundMe in hopes we can all bring some holiday cheer back into this dark time. With this money we will get them a tree, some presents and put them up in a hotel or house, something they can call their own for at least a week or more depending on what is available and affordable.In this time of giving please consider offering even a small donation! We would be more then grateful!

When they rescued him, he was only 43lbs. On September 20 he was diagnosed with cancer in both anal glands and it has spread to his lymph nodes. There were a few different treatment options. I have decided against surgery, IV chemo, and daily radiation as it is just too invasive and the side effects are extreme. For the amount of time it could potentially give us, it is just too much to ask of my sweet boy. I have decided to give him chemotherapy in pill form. The pills alone will be $550 each month, providing the medication helps. There will also be monthly visits and tests to the oncologist. Another $500 monthly. I have already spent over $3,000 in doctor visits, tests and medications to get to this diagnosis. Radiation treatments could be $4000-$5500 if I were to pursue it. Giving Manny both chemo and radiation could give us 6-12 months. I have to hold off on radiation due to the cost. I simply cannot afford it. I honestly cannot even afford the chemotherapy, but I have to do something. This sweet boy of mine is my baby, my child. I love him with all my heart and it is killing me to have to consider the cost of treatment. Trying to figure out how to pay for all of this has led me to reach out here.

He's so smart, he flew through all of his classes including puppy star, CGC, and the service dog public access test.Two months ago, he started having discharge from his nose, so we took him to the vet, thinking there was an object he snuffled inside.

Nothing came out of the nasal flush, but Rory's nasal discharge continued. We had our vet refer us to Metropolitan Vet Specialists, who gave us the bad news.

Then thats when she looked up at me and thats when I knew, I needed to get to the animal hospital ASAP. We put her on a blanket and rushed her to the hospital.

       "  'Help Winston live out his final days with style! #WinstonsBucketList I never knew pain like this before. Mike and I have had the worst week of our lives. Our sweet kid Winston was diagnosed with one of the worst most deadly forms of cancer and we are left feeling helpless.Winston has been diagnosed with terminal Hemangiosarcoma and has been given a few short precious weeks to live.My husband and I welcomed Winston into our Denver, CO home in May 2011. We were 28 and 30 years old. We would be getting married in October 2011. We knew would always have Goldens, because I said so ;) Mike is from Nebraska and I am from Colorado. We swapped places during college. I went to the University of Nebraska and He went to Colorado State university. We have been married 4 yrs and just celebrated our 10yr \"best friend- aversary.\"We met Winston when he was 3weeks old and fell in love instantly. He was born March 28th, 2011. We took many visits up north to Fort Collins between meeting him and getting to bring him home. We knew he was meant to be in our family.Winston is now a 5 year old sweet, handsome Golden Retriever. He is an only child and the love of our lives. He is the most loving, loyal and amazing dog in the whole world. He is basically a Unicorn. He is more than a dog, he is our baby and my companion.He is well known in our neighborhood, whether it be sitting outside the grocery store, long walks or a trip to the gym. Everyone seems to know Winston. He is recognized by his sweet demeneor, kind personality, big head and even bigger heart. We want to give Winston the ultimate bucket list. We want to make the last few weeks of his life be as great as he is. We have friends and family across the country who are devastated and want to be a part of his last few weeks. We thought ok, lets allow all of these amazing people whom we love and those we don\\'t even know help to make his last weeks here with us special.So, we can\\'t sit back and do nothing. We can\\'t cure him, but we can make the time he has left with us truly amazing. We want to raise awareness about Pet Cancer, we want to comfort others who are going through this or have been through this. We want to give our friends and family peace around all of this. My husband and I want to find peace with it all, and most importantly we want Winston to be happy.We will use any of your donation money to pay for your bucket list item if needed. Please keep in mind we will have to do something local here in CO. No flying for Winston. Anything left over from your donation we will donate to Pet Cancer Research and the Golden Retriever Rescue Fund.We will document Winston\\'s adventures here as well as a facebook page, Link to follow shortly. He can also be found onInstagram @WinstonTheRetriever .Winston is pure JOY! We can\\'t thank you enough for being part of this unfortunate path we have found ourselves on. Thank you!Mom and I playing in the snow! How this all happened:On Tuesday May 10th, 2015 we had a vet appt. that would forever change our lives for the worse. Winston was having a limp in his back right hind leg as well as being incredibly lethargic. He had been having a small cough for the past couple weeks. Nothing excessive. Sounded like he was hacking up a hairball. He usually follows me around the house and is always by my side so his lethargy was incredibly concerning. Mike and I never hesitate taking Winston to the Vet. he loves it actually. I thought it was a pulled muscle and needed some pain meds and a little rest. No big deal. I was wrong...very very wrong.Our vet performed an overall physical exam and informed us that she thought it was an urgent situation that we needed to see a Veterinary Neurologist. We headed to our local animal hospital with prayers that we wold be able to see a neurologist that evening and we were preparing ourselves for a costly MRI and potential surgery. Anything for our baby!The ER vet on duty did another exam, Winston had a brief meeting with the Neurologist on call and she noted delayed neuro responses and sensitivity on his spine. Signs that were consistent with Disc Disease. Best case scenario a little inflammation in his discs treated by steroids, worst case..invasive back surgery.Not a great prognosis but not life ending. The ER vet administered some pain meds for Winston and performed a hip x-ray to ensure there were no broken bones or any other spinal issues that could be viewed on radiographs.We were informed it was not urgent and we scheduled a full neuro exam and an MRI in the morning with the doggy neurologist. Winston was loopy all evening from the pain meds but seemed to be moving on his leg a bit better.Mike had a late night flight to WY we decided he should go since I would just be taking Winston in for his MRI in the AM and he would be home by 4pm the next day. Just in time to pick up our sweet Wincy-Bear from coming off the anesthesia.Wednesday - May 11th 2016:Winston was putting weight on his back leg and seemed more like his normal self. Happy go lucky! The Neurologist performed a complete exam and we were about to proceed with the MRI and possibly surgery depending on what the MRI showed.The Neurologist decided to run a quick set of chest xrays to make sure that there wasn\\'t an infection. I thought his small cough for the past two weeks had been a sign of allergies and drinking water too fast. I even just stocked up on Claritin since he gets allergies really bad this time of year.Then it happened....... the neurologist brought the films back into the exam room and there I was alone..by myself listening to the doctor tell me that Winston had metastasized cancer in his lungs.There I was feeling like my heart had been ripped out of my chest and my child was hurting. I needed someone with me and my best friend Michelle was there in a matter of no time. I have never prayed for a person or a dog to have lymphoma. How did I end up praying for this? But I was praying for Lymphoma. Lymphoma was a best case scenario. Winston would need to be put on some meds to get him to lay still for is Abdominal Ultrasound. The goal of the ultra sound was to identify the source of the cancer so they could biopsy it and we could treat Winston with chemo.Many dogs who are diagnosed with Lymphoma can live a normal healthy life with chemo and surgery for several months and years. This wasn\\'t the case for Winston. They can\\'t find the tumor, blood work is normal, lymph nodes are normal. It\\'s all NORMAL!So we move down the crappy list again to Hemangiosarcoma. Worst case scenario possible.... We made an apt with the oncologist for Friday May 13th. Friday the 13th.... great! May 13th 2016We met with the oncologist she confirmed what we already knew. Some form of Malignant Heamgiosarcoma. Our prognosis was 1-3months. Months???? We wouldn\\'t have a 14yr old Golden. We won\\'t even have a 6yr old golden.We can\\'t find it but we know it is there and he doesn\\'t have long. So what? What now?Chemo round one. It was suggested that we start chemo immediately as his lung x-ray showed it was a fairly fast moving and very aggressive cancer. No time to spare. It is unsettling to treat a cancer we can\\'t even find. Putting drugs into your dog, praying it works.We proceeded with chemo and felt like the oncologist left us with several questions. What about alternative therapies? What about tea? I don\\'t know. What else can we do? I have to be able to do something.Winston seemed to handle the chemo very well. We played fetch all evening and he was even eating normally. We saw signs of lethargy and he couldn\\'t run as long as normal. But he seemed happy. He is always happy. That is the thing I love the most about him. He smiles...literally smiles!May 17th 2016.It\\'s my 33rd birthday today. This will go down in the history books as the worst birthday ever....hopefully, because I can\\'t imagine anything worse.Our first oncology appointment didn\\'t sit well with Mike and I. Yes, we were getting confirmation of the absolute worst outcome for our 5 yr old Golden. But it was the bed side manner? Lack of awareness? The yelling about our terminally ill dog across a waiting room while we are both holding back tears? It didn\\'t sit well.I needed another doctor. I made an appointment with another oncologist in town. Best case scenario: his lungs have cleared up. We were holding out hope this was some bizzaro fungal infection, or a weird case of bronchitis. With my medical knowledge consisting of whatever I learned on Greys Anatomy, I knew I was grasping. What can we say, sometimes blind hope is the only thing you have.I needed a doctor that would help me create a plan. A plan on what to feed him, what supplements, what could make his time left the best it could be.This doctor was kind and compassionate. Honest and realistic. Her presentation, the way she explained his condition made us feel so much better. It wasn\\'t what she was saying it was how she was saying it.We ran another x-ray. (insert blind hope). The x-ray showed that Winston\\'s lungs had not cleared up but actually appeared worse than they did 6 days before. The chemo and steroids appeared to not be working. We didn\\'t expect chemo to cure him but keep the cancer at bay or stop the spread.Based on these new x-rays Winston\\'s prognosis has deteriorated. He has been given 3-4 weeks. Possibly less. I can\\'t begin to tell you the pain and utter heartbreak we are feeling. May 18th 2016Winston came home with us 5 yrs ago today. It has been the best 5yrs and he is my best friend. His breathing was a bit labored today and his energy level seemed diminished after chasing a few balls. He could normally play for hours. Snow for days! I am a true Colorado dog. I am covered in snow balls!!! It is AWESOME!Dad and I have snuggle time too. Mom calls me her Golden Bear. We are in Vail. It\\'s one of my favorite places in the world! I am so patient with my parents. ;)You have to drag me in from the snow. I could chase snowballs ALL DAY! I own this house. I sit where I want. Mom puts glasses and hats on me sometimes. I don\\'t mind. I sometimes sleep sitting up. I am honest to a fault. I stole 99% of these tennis balls from our neighbors front yards. I genuinely smile and pose for photos. I can\\'t help but not smile. I am so so happy!'),\n",

The Benson's are wonderful people, they rescued Hank in 2015 at the age of 10! He was adoptedfrom a shelter in Pittsburgh where he was living after being found as a stray. Hank was found emaciated, had fur loss over his entire body due to skin infections. After being examinded by their Veterinarian, it was also determined that Hank had severe hip dysplasia. At the time they were able to keep Hank comfortable using anti-inflammatory and pain medications. A little over a year after his adoption, Hank had a mass removed around his throat areawhere the vet found a 22 caliber bullet lodged in his neck. This poor guy has really been through a lot! He now lives a peaceful life with two other dog brothers, Bear and Tripper. Anyone that meets Hank would not be able to deny how happy he is to have a new life with the Bensons.Hank now faces new challenges though...He is no longer responding to his medication and his hip dysplasia causes him severepain. Their veterinarian has given them two options, hip surgery...or euthinasia. The Benson's would do anything for their dogs, so they have opted to have the surgery. The first hip replacement surgery is scheduled for February 16th, 2017. The cost is tremendous and I would love to see the community come together to help this amazing family. They have already done and continue to do so much for their rescue dogs. No donation is too small, and if you can't donate, sharing this on your Facebook would also be very helpful!

       "  'The Niombato Library Project The \"Cultures and Customs of Senegal\" program, which developed in 2011 lead by SUNY Albany, Union College, and Albany College of Pharmacy, introduced me to the Senegalese reality. While attending, I had the opportunity to visit several unique places in Senegal and became aware of the disparities adolescence and youth face within the varying educational programs available. Mr. Waly Faye (liaison in Senegal) and program director at the West African Research Center (W.A.R.C.) has (in addition to directing us through the Study Abroad program) been a resident of the Niombato village who helped identify the need of a touring library in coalition with the Niombato Students Association. Mr. Faye as the president of Participatory Action for International Development (PAID) has described to me his broader plan to support literacy and education for middle and high school aged students. Within the broader plan is a specific plan to support a travelling library that will be accessible primarily to middle and high school students without fees or charges. The main goal is to allow people, particularly students of the community to have access to resources of knowledge and media outlets such as internet, books on their syllabus, general books, articles etc. The library will be settled in the easily accessible village of Karang in which Waly is a member of. In addition to the library center in Niombato there will be a touring part in each of the four villages with local middle schools hosting several of the books for two months before giving it back for another one. The initial phase that consists of locating an area, identifying its needs, and implementing a plan to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of the area based on the communities assets has been designed and implemented with the work of Mr. Faye and his position in the community. The second phase of the program, which encompasses fundraising, outreach, project analysis, book drives, and grant seeking has begun and will continue until the third and final development phase. This final stage, which will begin upon arrival in Dakar and begin with the purchasing of the requested amenities in addition to the development of the library in Niombato (Building shelves, tables, chairs, basic library/classroom development). I will be personally working with Mr. Faye from this point forward to deliver the books to the village as well as complete the final phase of the project which includes installing the library with the help of the Niombato Students Association.  Although some books may come from the United States there are large second hand book markets in Dakar that will be used primarily to purchase the books and materials required to create and sustain the project. The books received here will be used as additional books that will help develop the library beyond the needs of the students\\' basic course curriculum. Based on an analysis conducted $3000 will cover the three phases of the project, which will then be allocated to them as follows. Budget:Computers/E-Books:::::::::::::::.$1,200Travel/transportation::::::::::...$950*Shipment of books::::::::::::$500Tables:::::::::::::::::$200Chairs:::::::::::::::::$125Bookshelves::::::::::::::..$200 *International travel expenses will total an estimated cost of $1,500 - $1,600.

I offered them food, blankets, and money, all of which they kindly declined. They stated that they did not seek sympathy, but appreciated the offer. However, they did ask if I could do them one favor. Eager to help in any way that I could, of course, I without second thought, said yes. The lady responded, \"Could you please just keep us in your prayers?\" At a loss for words, I shook my head and agreed.   After talking to the mother and daughter for quite some time I got to know a bit about them. We also discussed the poor economic times, the amount of crime happening in the world, the greed of many landlords in Williamsport and surrounding areas, and a local shelter that has been unfortunately infested with bedbugs. Shortly after they reassured me they didn\\'t need anything more, and I was on my way.   Later this evening, I traveled the same road to pick up a friend, as it was thunderstorming pretty bad. I seen the two lovely ladies I talked to previous, curled up in their blanket trying to stay dry, my heart broke. Soon after seeing them I took them food, and a cold drink.

I am now in Africa and I am providing aid in the countries I am moving through by giving my strength in their fields and helping out anyway I can in the villages I walk through. It has been a dream of mine to search for the movement of people and their way of life. Through practice I have morphed this into finding good people and exposing them for their kindness and still using movement as my motivation. Originally I was going to walk the whole way but recent events have brought a change to my outlook on this journey and I have decided to make it to South Africa any way I can. I have already made it through Scotland, England, France, Spain, Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, The Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso and am currently in Niger. I'm going to make it one way or another. With famine, Ebola outbreaks, lack of clean water, sanitary food, hostile zones, kidnappings and wild life, it will be a real feat to complete this journey. We will need sponsorships which I am hoping will come from more then just friends and family. I see that we have the ability help make a difference in people's lives and it's happening. With frequent updates onWww.youtube.com/user/xreilloand weekly blog postings onWww.xavierreillo.comChapters will include food, music, dance, transportation, boarder crossing and living as the locals do.

Those videos will be the content for the documentary. I am also writing a book with the content I get from my weekly blog postings. In order to survive I will have to adapt to things that arise which we're not planned for. I am asking the public to join in on a quest to show that traveling is safe and inexpensive and to expose the good people that help along the way. At times it will not be glamorous and the realities of life in different countries is sometimes desperate. Year in Africa will shine some light on this by bringing awareness to life outside of our own stomping grounds.It's safe to travel in numbers, at times so when you see a fellow traveler don't be afraid to say hello, you never know what kind of an adventure they could take you on!\"),\n",

We have 12 talented, skilled young ladies who not only work hard on the field, but who also maintain high academics in order to participate. We competed in the Wescon Regional Cheer Competition in Phoenix, AZ on Saturday, November 19 with excitement as we had the opportunity to show off our routine. We all HOPED for a first or second place trophy, but knowing we were competing with nine teams we knew that it was not going to be an easy task. The girls worked hard, cheered their hearts out and earned 2nd Place in the competition. 1st and 2nd Place winners have the opportunity to advance to Nationals in Orlando, FL. This is a DREAM COME TRUE to our girls. This money will be used to help our girls fly to Florida for the Pop Warner National Competition the first week of December. We will be able to pay our National Fees and book our rooms at the resort, which is mandatory of all participants. We would have the chance to Fly into Florida, attend our Practice Day, attend our Performance Day and then fly home. Although a short trip, this will be an experience of a lifetime for our TEAM!We have just two weeks to prepare for this competition! Such a short time, but it was so unexpected that we didn't prepare for this opportunity ahead of time. Our girls have a lot of work ahead of them to make this DREAM a REALITY. We would greatly appreciate your support. This will be the FIRST time Lake Havasu City has had a team qualify for Nationals since 2008. This is a HUGE accomplishment for not only our girls, but our Pop Warner Association - Lake Havasu Youth Football & Cheer.\"),\n",

This is crazy because they very rarely let any international competitors compete at all! EVER! This has been a dream for so long ever since I saw Sasuke 9 years ago and I have been making that dream come closer every year! I didnt know how or when but I knew If I kept at it just like everything else in my life that doors would open and opportunities would present themselves, and they did! Unfortunately this has been very bad timing because I am currently doing Sasuke in Vietnam and they just told me. My finances have been exhausted just from getting out here and now I will have to change my flight and then book a one way back to the states. (Not the cheapest thing last minute) Then if I pass Sasuke qualifying round (which consists of push ups, sit ups, running etc) I will have to come back in about month or so to actually compete on the show. With your help we can make this happen! Also anyone who donates $25 or more I will send them a high quality comfy fabric Reko Rivera t-shirt (sizes are limited at the moment) fb message me your size and address. Thank you for everyone who has believed in me and supported me along the way. The messages and comments about inspiring others is worth all the hard work, time, and dedication put into this silly dream of mine. If I can inspire just one kid to follow his dreams and live a positive life then I think its all worth it :-) I will do my best to represent USA in this amazing event!'),\n",

The team, which received no funding from the School District of Philadelphia, was able to compete only thanks to a tremendous outpouring of support from Philadelphias civic community.In order to quicklyraise the needed funds to pay for the trip, former Mayor Michael Nutter secured $20,000 each from the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. Those transformative donations  combined with over $21,000 raised from alumni and families of Central High School and the general public through a GoFundMe campaign  allowed 39 student team members to travel to St. Louis to compete. The financial support we received was particularly important because it ensured that every student was able to attend at no cost to their families  a crucial achievement for a team from Central High School, where 60 percent of students come from economically disadvantaged families. Beyond funding the World Championship trip, the $70,000 raised last year closed a budget deficit and allowed long-deferred upgrades to tools and equipment.(Appeal continues below the infographic)The RoboLancers have emerged as a leader of Philadelphia robotics teams, providing financial assistance or weekly student mentorship to six other teams. They serve approximately 55 additional teams each year by hosting citywide robotics competitions and workshops where teams from different schools come together to share tools and materials, and learn from each other. Their Philly Robotics Expo, now in its sixth year, brings in hundreds of K12 school children each spring for a full day of workshops, activities, and demonstrations.Because of this work, the RoboLancers won the Chairmans Award at the Mid-Atlantic Robotics regional championship this past Saturday for the second year running. The Chairmans Award is the most prestigious award in FIRST robotics  each year just two out of the 121 teams in the Mid-Atlantic region receive this honor. The award is a testament to the RoboLancers continued work to expand outreach efforts, providing opportunities for children in schools across Philadelphia to get excited about STEM.We leveraged last years successful season to secure additional recurring funding for our team that has enabled us to redouble outreach efforts aimed at expanding access to STEM educational opportunities for students at other schools across Philadelphia. Although we have taken advantage of this additional funding to strengthen our teams own finances, we had no idea that we would win this prestigious award again this year. (We had budgeted for another World Championship trip in two or three years, not one!)We are thus seeking at least $35,000 in outside support, which, combined with the teams own resources, will again permit us to send about 40 team members, along with chaperones, to the World Championship.

He is a selfless person who has always given to others. Last January, he had a catastrophic ski accident, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down and necessitating the amputation of his leg. He has never asked Why me? or How could this have happened? He is truly an inspiration, and I am in awe of his strength. David has accepted his situation and has only looked forward, never back. In order for him to continue toward independence and to further his therapy, he needs medical equipment and a special vehicle that would allow him to drive on his own. Im asking you to help him reach these goals by making a contribution for him. Any amount will help, even $5 will make a difference. Living in Newtown Ct. David and his family know the importance of coming together and supporting one another when bad things happen. Please help us by making a contribution for David.Below is his story in his own words.After 50 years of downhillskiing,and 25 years of raising my kids to ski and snowboard, I lost control on some black ice and hit a tree at full speed. I dont remember the actual impact, just hitting the ice beforeand then laying on the slope after with a compound fracture of my right leg and a spinal cord injury. What followed has been an amazing journey through medical treatment, rehabilitation therapy and the support of an incredible family and community.The accident occurred on January 2, 2016. I spent the next two weeks in the intensive care unit at the UniversityofVermont Medical Center. The first week was spentreconstructing my leg and healingmy bruised ribs and organs so I could be rolled over for the back surgery. I had my back surgery the second week. The surgeon took some bone tissue from my hip to repair the damaged vertebra and then fusedvertebraT-4  T-11 together with titanium rods. The back and leg surgeries went well meaning that they at least stabilized my condition so that I could move on to the next stepwhich wasinpatient rehabilitation at the Kessler Institute in New Jersey.There I learned how to use a wheelchair, how to transfer to and from a bed, to and from a car, how to shower, how to dress and how to live as a paraplegic.One month after the accident, it became apparent that the woundon my leg from the compound fracture would not heal. The tissue and blood flow did not recover and it seemed to be facilitating an infection that was affecting the rest of my body. We decided to amputate above the knee.I know it sounds crazy but without that legdragging me down I was much more clear-headed and energetic.After two and half months of in patient rehabilitative therapy, I went home and the real work began. We had to adapt the front walk and stairs so I could get into the house and make some modifications to accommodate my wheelchair.As I got stronger and figured things out I became much more independent, my wife returned to work and I was able to be left alone during the day. My real freedom came though when an Eagle Scout candidate in town decided to build a permanent ramp to get me into my house from my front walk. Once that was completed I could get from inside my house down to my driveway and garage unassisted. I am determined to return to work full time or as close to it as possible. I recently completed training and am now certified to drive a car with hand controls. I would like to help David raise enough money so that he can buy a new van. If we are successful, and I believe with your help we can be, the state will pay for the conversion to add a ramp, hand controls and a modified drivers seat. The cost of such a vehicle, is between $40,000 - $50,000. In addition, David and Lynn need to make some additional modifications to their house so that he can get into and out of the shower easily, and so that he can reach appliances and the sink in the kitchen. These are small things that would allow him toward his independence. Finally, he is in need of some therapeutic equipment that is not covered by insurance. We are asking you, friends, family, and community members, to help David to be able to afford the things he needs for greater independence. Please give what you can. We thank you for your support.Nancy Wiener Joffe'),\n",

       "  'Let\\'s help a 56-year old Detroiter whowalks 21 miles a day to work - have a reliable and insured vehicle. Heartwarming story below.## STORY FROM DETROIT FREE PRESS (byBill Laitner) ##\\nHeart and sole: Detroiter walks 21 miles in work commuteHe doesn\\'t look athletic but James Robertson, 56, of Detroit has a champ\\'s commute. He rides buses part-way but walks about 21 miles in round trips to a factory, unless his banker pal offers a lift.Pudgy of form, shod in heavy work boots, Robertson trudges almost haltingly as he starts another workday.But as he steps out into the cold, Robertson, 56, is steeled for an Olympic-sized commute. Getting to and from his factory job 23 miles away in Rochester Hills, he\\'ll take a bus partway there and partway home. And he\\'ll also walk an astounding 21 miles.Five days a week. Monday through Friday.It\\'s the life Robertson has led for the last decade, ever since his 1988 Honda Accord quit on him.Every trip is an ordeal of mental and physical toughness for this soft-spoken man with a perfect attendance record at work. And every day is a tribute to how much he cares about his job, his boss and his coworkers. Robertson\\'s daunting walks and bus rides, in all kinds of weather, also reflect the challenges some metro Detroiters face in getting to work in a region of limited bus service, and where car ownership is priced beyond the reach of many.But you won\\'t hear Robertson complain  nor his boss.\\n\"I set our attendance standard by this man,\" says Todd Wilson, plant manager at Schain Mold & Engineering. \"I say, if this man can get here, walking all those miles through snow and rain, well I\\'ll tell you, I have people in Pontiac 10 minutes away and they say they can\\'t get here  bull!\"As he speaks of his loyal employee, Wilson leans over his desk for emphasis, in a sparse office with a view of the factory floor. Before starting his shift, Robertson stops by the office every day to talk sports, usually baseball. And during dinnertime each day, Wilson treats him to fine Southern cooking, compliments of the plant manager\\'s wife.\"Oh, yes, she takes care of James. And he\\'s a personal favorite of the owners because of his attendance record. He\\'s never missed. I\\'ve seen him come in here wringing wet,\" says Wilson, 53, of Metamora Township.With a full-time job and marathon commutes, Robertson is clearly sleep deprived, but powers himself by downing 2-liter bottles of Mountain Dew and cans of Coke.\"I sleep a lot on the weekend, yes I do,\" he says, sounding a little amazed at his schedule. He also catches zzz\\'s on his bus rides. Whatever it takes to get to his job, Robertson does it.\"I can\\'t imagine not working,\" he says.\\'Lord, keep me safe\\'The sheer time and effort of getting to work has ruled Robertson\\'s life for more than a decade, ever since his car broke down. He didn\\'t replace it because, he says, \"I haven\\'t had a chance to save for it.\" His job pays $10.55 an hour, well above Michigan\\'s minimum wage of $8.15 an hour but not enough for him to buy, maintain and insure a car in Detroit.As hard as Robertson\\'s morning commute is, the trip home is even harder.At the end of his 2-10 p.m. shift as an injection molder at Schain Mold\\'s squeaky-clean factory just south of M-59, and when his coworkers are climbing into their cars, Robertson sets off, on foot  in the dark  for the 23-mile trip to his home off Woodward near Holbrook. None of his coworkers lives anywhere near him, so catching a ride almost never happens.Instead, he reverses the 7-mile walk he took earlier that day, a stretch between the factory and a bus stop behind Troy\\'s Somerset Collection shopping mall.\"I keep a rhythm in my head,\" he says of his seemingly mechanical-like pace to the mall.At Somerset, he catches the last SMART bus of the day, just before 1 a.m. He rides it into Detroit as far it goes, getting off at the State Fairgrounds on Woodward, just south of 8 Mile. By that time, the last inbound Woodward bus has left. So Robertson foots it the rest of the way  about 5 miles  in the cold or rain or the mild summer nights, to the home he shares with his girlfriend.\"I have to go through Highland Park, and you never know what you\\'re going to run into,\" Robertson says. \"It\\'s pretty dangerous. Really, it is (dangerous) from 8 Mile on down. They\\'re not the type of people you want to run into.\"But I\\'ve never had any trouble,\" he says. Actually, he did get mugged several years ago  \"some punks tuned him up pretty good,\" says Wilson, the plant manager. Robertson chooses not to talk about that.So, what gets him past dangerous streets, and through the cold and gloom of night and winter winds?\"One word  faith,\" Robertson says. \"I\\'m not saying I\\'m a member of some church. But just before I get home, every night, I say, \\'Lord, keep me safe.\\'\"The next day, Robertson adds, \"I should\\'ve told you there\\'s another thing: determination.\"A land of no busesRobertson\\'s 23-mile commute from home takes four hours. It\\'s so time-consuming because he must traverse the no-bus land of rolling Rochester Hills. It\\'s one of scores of tri-county communities (nearly 40 in Oakland County alone) where voters opted not to pay the SMART transit millage. So it has no fixed-route bus service.Once he gets to Troy and Detroit, Robertson is back in bus country. But even there, the bus schedules are thin in a region that is relentlessly auto-centric.\"The last five years been really tough because the buses cut back,\" Robertson says. Both SMART and DDOT have curtailed service over the last half decade, \"and with SMART, it really affected service into Detroit,\" said Megan Owens, executive director of Transportation Riders United.Detroit\\'s director of transportation said there is a service Robertson may be able to use that\\'s designed to help low-income workers. Job Access and Reverse Commute, paid for in part with federal dollars, provides door-to-door transportation to low-income workers, but at a cost. Robertson said he was not aware of the program.Still, metro Detroit\\'s lack of accessible mass transit hasn\\'t stopped Robertson from hoofing it along sidewalks  often snow-covered  to get to a job.At home at workRobertson is proud of all the miles he covers each day. But it\\'s taking a toll, and he\\'s not getting any younger.\"He comes in here looking real tired  his legs, his knees,\" says coworker Janet Vallardo, 59, of Auburn Hills.But there\\'s a lot more than a paycheck luring him to make his weekday treks. Robertson looks forward to being around his coworkers, saying, \"We\\'re like a family.\" He also looks forward to the homemade dinners the plant manager\\'s wife whips up for him each day.\"I look at her food, I always say, \\'Excellent. No, not excellent. Phenomenal,\\'\" he says, with Wilson sitting across from him, nodding and smiling with affirmation.Although Robertson eats in a factory lunchroom, his menus sound like something from a Southern caf: Turnip greens with smoked pork neck bones, black-eyed peas and carrots in a brown sugar glaze, baby-back ribs, cornbread made from scratch, pinto beans, fried taters, cheesy biscuits. They\\'re the kind of meal that can fuel his daunting commutes back home.Though his job is clearly part of his social life, when it\\'s time to work this graduate of Northern High School is methodical. He runs an injection-molding machine the size of a small garage, carefully slicing and drilling away waste after removing each finished part, and noting his production in detail on a clipboard.Strangers crossing pathsRobertson has walked the walk so often that drivers wonder: Whoisthat guy? UBS banker Blake Pollock, 47, of Rochester, wondered. About a year ago, he found out.Pollock tools up and down Crooks each day in his shiny black 2014 Chrysler 300.\"I saw him so many times, climbing through snow banks. I saw him at all different places on Crooks,\" Pollock recalls.Last year, Pollock had just parked at his office space in Troy as Robertson passed. The banker in a suit couldn\\'t keep from asking the factory guy in sweats, what the heck are you doing, walking out here every day? They talked a bit. Robertson walked off and Pollock ruminated.From then on, Pollock began watching for the factory guy. At first, he\\'d pick him up occasionally, when he could swing the time. But the generosity became more frequent as winter swept in. Lately, it\\'s several times a week, especially when metro Detroit sees single-digit temperatures and windchills.\"Knowing what I know, I can\\'t drive past him now. I\\'m in my car with the heat blasting and even then my feet are cold,\" Pollock says.Other times, it\\'s 10:30 or 11 p.m., even after midnight, when Pollock, who is divorced, is sitting at home alone or rolling home from a night out, and wondering how the man he knows only as \"James\" is doing in the frigid darkness.On those nights, Pollock runs Robertson all the way to his house in Detroit.\"I asked him, why don\\'t you move closer\" to work. \"He said his girlfriend inherited their house so it\\'s easy to stay there,\" Pollock said.On a recent night run, Pollock got his passenger home at 11 p.m. They sat together in the car for a minute, outside Robertson\\'s house.\"So, normally you\\'d be getting here at 4 o\\'clock (in the morning), right?\" the banker asks. \"Yeah,\" Robertson replies. Pollock flashes a wry smile. \"So, you\\'re pretty early, aren\\'t you?\" he says. Robertson catches the drift.\"Oh, I\\'m grateful for the time, believe me,\" Robertson says, then adds in a voice rising with anticipation: \"I\\'m going to take me a bath!\"After the door shuts and Pollock pulls away, he admits that Robertson mystifies him, yet leaves him stunned with admiration for the man\\'s uncanny work ethic and determination.\"I always say to my friends, I\\'m not a nice guy. But I find myself helping James,\" Pollock says with a sheepish laugh. He said he\\'s picked up Robertson several dozen times this winter alone.Has a routineAt the plant, coworkers feel odd seeing one of their team numbers always walking, says Charlie Hollis, 63, of Pontiac. \"I keep telling him to get him a nice little car,\" says Hollis, also a machine operator.Echoes the plant manager Wilson, \"We are very much trying to get James a vehicle.\" But Robertson has a routine now, and he seems to like it, his coworkers say.\"If I can get away, I\\'ll pick him up. But James won\\'t get in just anybody\\'s car. He likes his independence,\" Wilson says.Robertson has simple words for why he is what he is, and does what he does. He speaks with pride of his parents, including his father\\'s military service.\"I just get it from my family. It\\'s a lot of walking, I know.\"'),\n",

       "  \"Dear friends,\\n\\n\\nThis project was made to raise money to buy an 1878 Collin-Mezin violin. This violin will enable me to reacha higher level on my instrument,necessary to start my Doctoral Degree.My current violin, while it has taken me this far, has reached a sound threshold. It's incapability is holding me back from reaching a higher level of playing, necessary to support the next step in my professional career. \\n\\nI come from a humble family and had it not been for the generous scholarships and support that I have been blessed with, there would have been no other way to take my art as far as I have. As an international student, I cannot legally work in the country, nor take out loans. I have been working hard to keep my dream alive, but the lack of a good instrument has created many obstacles in my journey.\\n\\nAn instrument is much more than a tool, but rather a sophisticated relationship that both challenges and inspires. I have had the priviledge to prepare and perform several concerts over the last three months an 1878 Collin-Mezin, a french violin, and my time with this instrument has been nothing short of enriching. My musical imagination has reaped the wonderful benefits of practicing on this instrument and in many ways I have regained a feeling of hope and confidence in my artistic self-expression.Unfortunately, I am in a predicament where if I cannot raise the money by the end of Julyto pay for this violin I have to return it.\\n\\nAs a violinist, my sound and my musical voice, not only depends on my talent but also upon the instrument I use. I created a very strong connection with the Collin Mezin, and my feelingshearing the sounds I produce with this violin are indescribable. I'm sure that if I have to return this instrument part of my musical voice is going to be silenced.\\n\\nThe cost of a professional violin varies on a wide spectrum and to find one of this quality at such a price is a challenge. I have played many instruments that have cost more than 10 times but did not speak as well in my hands. I am fortunate I found an instrument worth the fight. \\n\\nMusic changed my life, and I have hopes of being able to change the lives of many for the better through the violin.\\n\\nIt's my dreamto further my education as a doctoral student and to sow all the benefits of learning an instrument with society by contributing to the whole community, sharing music and my love for the instrument. In order to keep these dreams alive I really need a suitable violin. \\n\\nYou can be part of this story! Please help me keep the Collin Mezin! Any contribution will help me in realizing this dream.Alone we can do so little, together we can do the impossible!\\n\\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nHow did you find it? \\n\\nI first came across this instrument at the 2014 American String Teachers Association Convention hosted in Louisville, KY. I had been in the market for professional violin for the last three years but had neither the expenses nor the right encounter with an instrument that I could commit to. With, quite literally, minutes left in the convention I ran over to a table in the vender exposition to try one last instrument. The experience was nothing less than love at first sight!\\n\\n Why this violin? \\n\\nMusic making is a combustion of elements and not all instruments have the same chemical reaction in the hands of other players. This instrument responds to my touch and I realize a higher musical self when I play on it. This violin has a naturally rich and round timbre that projects effortlessly. The higher register remains sweet and present without becoming overly bright. The physical dimensions of the instrument are like a puzzle piece that intertwines with my hands and I feel very comfortable playing this violin. The cost of a professional violin varies on a wide spectrum and to find one of this quality at such a price is a challenge. I have played many instruments that have cost more than triple but did not speak as well in my hands.\\n\\n How much does the violin cost?\\n\\nThe violin costs $15,000 dollars. In order to raise this amount of money, I have to raise $17,000 to compensate for the 12% fee Gofundme.com will charge me from all the money donated.\\n\\n Why is this violin so expensive?\\n\\nAs odd as it might sound, this violin is inexpensive when compared to other old professional violins. The price range of this kind of instrument varies between $15K, all the way to millions of dollars. Thats right, millions.Not all instruments are created equally, and most violins are expensive today mainly due to the high workmanship skills possessed by the famous violin makers, like Stradivari, Guarneri, or Collin-Mezin, who produced violins that are one-of-a-kind. The quality of the materials used to make the antique violins does determine the price of the violins too. If you do an online search of expensiveviolins, you will notice that the famous Stradivarius violins were made in the period between 1700 and 1725. Many termed this Stradivari's 'golden period'. Numerous experts discussed that the violins made during that period were considered the best due to the presence of a special quality of wood, which only existed during that period. Other than the wood used during the golden period of Stradivari, other top quality woods were used for many other antique violins, and which also determine the sound and tone quality produced by them. Generally, the slower growing and higher altitude varieties of wood have more clarity and depth, a better balance of sound. Of course, these select tone-woods are more rare, and thus more expensive. The price of the violin, besides the quality of materials and the quality of workmanship, are also estimated accordingly to the way the violin sounds. People use descriptive terms such as Sweet, Dry, Warm, Bright, Clear, and Muddy as some of the descriptions of sound produced. A Bright violin may be a little harsh under the ear, but carry very well and be easy to hear when playing with other musicians. A Warm violin may be satisfying to play solo, a clear violin might be good for playing in an ensemble. Yet another reason is the Supply and Demand. There are few old violins that survived history, and they are no longer being made. Simple economics dictates that, when there is a demand but little supply, value increases. Another thing to consider is that violins are also a piece of art. Violin Makers can certainly be compared to painters, sculptures, and other artists, while the Mona Lisa can be easily compared to one of the top Stradivari violins. The historic value of these instruments also contributes for the total estimated price of the violins. While the violin itself can cost millions, there are violin bows that command tens of thousands of dollars too.\\n\\nWhy can the Guri Project not help you buy the violin? \\n\\nThe incarnation of the Guri Project that gave me my passion for the violin and funded my undergraduate education and artist diploma no longer exists in the same capacity. Today the program is known as Reference Groups (Grupos de Referncia) where exemplarily students receive a small monthly scholarship towards their studies. The budget of the current project is based on private donations and government funding, and in my case, the project could not validate partitioning their resources to this instrument.\\n\\n Why can you not work during summer time to raise the money? What about loans?\\n\\nAs an international student I am not allowed to legally work in the country nor take out student loans. Under these conditions, private loans are also challenging to acquire as I have already made several attempts.Why investing on me? I believe I have a truly unique story that does not mold to the young child receiving private lessons under the watchful eye of their parents. While in Brazil there were many struggles to keep music in my life. I have carried my personal work ethic with me to over a dozen countries, where if I worked hard, ends would meet. I often feel a pressure against time, where many of my peers have been performing on professional instruments for as long as I have been studying the violin. I envision great things for my career, it is my dream to be among the highest level of violin performers, performing as a solo recitalist and delivering my music to as many people as I can reach through recordings and live performances. I also plan to sow all the benefits of learning an instrument with society by contributing to the whole community, sharing music and my love for the instrument.\\n\\nWhy is your old violin not good enough?\\n\\nI currently own a copy of a Jacob Stainer, which I purchased in Bulgaria with the help of the Guri Project. The violin served me well for the beggining of my undergraduate education. Unfortunately, the violins limitations began to impede my technical and musical progress by the end of my Bachelors degree. For the entire duration of my artists diploma, I performed on a violin graciously loaned by my former teacher, Andres Cardenes. When I arrived in Louisville, I had to leave my teachers violin in Pittsburgh. While pursing my Masters, the limitations of my own instrument became more obvious. Some of the challenges include a lack of projection, wolf pitches on the G string, a lack of clarity in the higher register, and a lack of balance between the 4 strings. I was delighted that all of these challenges were not present when I first played the Collin-Mezzin. Would small donations like $5 still help? Yes! Every little bit helps!\\n\\n Why do you have 2 websites?\\n\\nMost simply, the Brazilian website (kickante) that I am also using was set up to help facilitate the donation process with the conversion of currency. Also, the Kickante campaign does not require a credit card in order to make donations which allows the campaign to reach a wider audience.\\n\\nWhen can I expect my rewards?\\n\\nYou can expect your rewards no later than a month of your donation. The only exceptions apply to the CD project and Composer Collaboration Rewards.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis video was made with the contribution of the Guri Project, So Paulo - Brazil. Special thanks to Michael Kagan, Helen Valadares, Alessandra Costa,Isabela Fernandes, Vinicius Nakamura, Tim Hutchens, and many friends for helping me put this campaign together.\"),\n",

We may not look alike, we are not the same age and we are not related but our birthdays are on the same day and our love for each other is immense and thats enough to make us twins. Raul is a very talented artist who creates some amazing works of art despite his physical limitations. He was born with muscular dystrophy and he wasnt expected to live past 14 years old. Hes now 40 and that is a miracle in itself. Muscular Dystrophy is a progressive wasting of his muscles, each year he loses more muscle and more independence. He has known a life where he could walk to the one now where hes confined to the abilities of his wheelchair instead of the abilities of his body. He relies on the grace of other people, not just for experiencing life, but to get to doctors appointments and to assist him in being able to continue with the thing he loves mosthis art. People with big hearts build his canvases, take him to buy supplies, and assist with everything involved in his shows or events. He can no longer drive his own truck and is very much in need of a wheelchair accessible van. Leaving the house is limited to friends and family with the ability to still lift him into his little Toyota pick-up truck because his motorized chair needs to go where he goes. Currently, you have to unfold a heavy rickety ramp and line it up on the back of the flatbed and cautiously get a 250lb chair up it without it veering off the narrow ramp. Being able to go out also depends on the weather, transporting his chair this way risks his chair getting rained on and damaged. This van would change his life and give him some freedom and a little independence that everyone deserves. Muscular Dystrophy has stolen things from him over the years that we all take for granted and yet he remains such a beautiful and inspirational soul. You know your life is better just for having him in it. Lets give him something back. Lets give him the simple ability to put himself in and out of the car and not be limited to where he can go and what he can do based on if someone is around to do it for him. Lets shine the same light in his world that he adds to ours. He should be a world renowned artist with money out his wazoo because his talent is endless but he is notYET! So I\\'m asking for the help of many hands. If you can spare $5, $10, $20 or more, please consider helping him because he deserves a heart as happy as he makes ours.

His name is Christopher. He is 66 yrs old, a proud Marine Vietnam veteran who has devoted his life to be in service to others, especially recovering alcoholics. He is a champion of womens rights and personal empowerment.Christopher is a loyal, honest and devoted partner who has healed and elevated me through our relationship. Through Chriss healing love, within months of our first date, God's gift of true love was apparent as well as a free energy that enabled us to move easily through transition as we quickly merged our lives together. His comment to all the chaos of newly merging two households under one roof Honey, I welcome this clutter because it means that you are with me. Yes, this is the kind of man he is. Eight months from our first date, Christopher was rushed to the ER due to critically low-sodium and released 8 days later. After a stint in the ICU, he emerged with a lethal diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer. The average life expectancy from time of diagnosis is 6  12 months. On our first date, Christopher spoke of an unfulfilled dream that hes had deep in his heart since he was 5 yrs old  to wander the hills and valleys of Ireland. I knew at that moment, among other things, I was put in Christophers life to help him manifest this lifelong dream. We married four months after the cancer diagnosis. Though both of us were married and divorced before, the gravity of our love drew us together inevitably despite the grave prognosis we are now both facing (Chriss cancer has metastasized since the initial diagnosis). We got married last November at a friends cottage walking hand in hand to the Beatles All You Need Is Love because we discovered through our journey and by the grace of Gods love, that loveis truly all we need. So, we are appealing to the greater, global love of humanity. We recognize that we all have dreams and loves. Christophers cancer and the complications of this diagnosis forced him to quit work which cut our income significantly. We do not have the financial means on our own to fund Christophers dream and time is of the essence - for all of us really.We thank you for taking the time to read our story  one of many beautiful stories of love. If you feel moved to help us manifest Christophers dream, bless you and thank you. If you feel moved to say a prayer or send Christopher healing light and energy, bless you and thank you.

Carl was unable to continue independent cardiopulmonary functions within 12 hours of being born and was placed on an ECMO machine at U of M Mott Childrens Hospital. (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation, meaning heart-lung bypass). Carl had many complications arise during his treatment at the U of M Mott Childrens Hospital but was eventually discharged on December 6, 2010.Carl has had multiple medical challenges in his short life. Although Carl has made great progress there are still existing conditions which require various medical professionals to be actively involved. Those conditions producing the most concern are Adrenal insufficiency, GK (Glycerol Kinase Deficiency) and DMD (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy). In addition to these genetic disorders, Carl has a curved spine and only one fully functional lung and kidney. Carl is taking various medications, his weight is below average for his age, and he also has delayed development primarily due to his medical conditions. Despite having all the hardships to contend with Carl has an outgoing personality and a very positive, determined character.Due to Carls medical conditions, he requires appointments with various medical professionals. These include periodic appointments to U of M Mott Childrens Hospital, Joel Greenburg, his pediatrician, and Sparrow Hospital to obtain blood test results. In addition to this, Carl has periodic physical and speech therapy appointments at Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids. Carl also participates in a program which allows Grand Valley State physical therapy students to become familiar with his medical history and spend time with him in therapy sessions, a mutually beneficial arrangement.

       "  'Hello GoFundMe ----- On August 11, 1997 I fell asleep at the wheel. My car rolled off the side of the road and down a hill. Due to multiple surgeries, anesthesia and pain medicine, my first memories were roughly 2 weeks after the crash. I was told I have an 80% contusion of the L1 vertebrae, paralysis. I was a paraplegic, in other words, bound to a wheelchair. Despite this tragic event I was back at work that November( \\'97 ) part time. 1.5 years before my crash I had started working for a family owned technical recruiting company called ICC Corp, in Petaluma, CA. I really enjoyed technical recruiting and they were very supportive during my recovery....helping me every step of my rehab. Unfortunately after the original owner sold the company, an auto parts company took over. The company disintegrated quickly and ceased to exist by 2003 due to a recession and a parent company called MSXI that didnt know staffing. I took another job in 2004 with a very large staffing company in the Silicon Valley. I will refer to them as X company. I learned a lot at company X. I really enjoyed my time there but around 2012 things changed. The CEO \"resigned\". Our 25 year long NorCal VP was let go. The company was suspended from the NYSE due to discrepencies in our financial records. After that ANYONE/everyone senior level was being fired or laid off. I was let go in September 2013. I found out the company was losing a LOT of money. Everyone senior level like myself was let go and replaced by a college graduate at half the price. I started looking for work and landed a permanent job with CHR in San Jose. I learned very quickly it was a horrible match for me. The recruiting manager was a hardware engineer and had never recruited. The commute from Alameda( where I moved after 10 years in San Jose ) to San Jose was 3-4 hours round trip. I didnt like anything about that job. At the end of May 2014 I was terminated. I would have quit, but I really needed the unemployment money. So I started looking for work again. I worked 4 different contract jobs and none that I wished became permanent. About the time I took my 2nd contract job, I contracted a bad urinary tract infection/UTI. This caused me to miss work quite a bit and in contracting you really cannot have any sick days. In the last 36-37 months I have been unemployed for 18 months. Not only did I have this illness but my age and wheelchair were a fairly big disadvantage in finding work. Two of my contract roles were just 1 phone interview, no on-site interviews. And when I rolled into those 2 jobs in my wheelchair, the disappointment was palpable. The other part of this story is starting in 2013, I was going through a divorce. I had to pay my lawyer a retainer fee of $3,500 and also $500 a month. And until we went before a judge which took 18 months, I was paying my ex wife $925 a month for child support. My healthcare has been Obamacare and I was paying $600 a month for healthcare and coming out of pocket for all prescriptions and doctor appts. I am 45k in debt due to divorce, REALLY bad healthcare, 18 months of unemployment and a urinary tract infection that has lingered for nearly 2 years. My car has 165k miles but given my debt, I cannot afford to buy a better car. My car in the past few years has needed a new transmission, a new starter, 2 new radiators, radiator hoses/fan, 2 oxidizers in the exhaust, a fuel pump and it started over heating last week. It now needs a new water pump which costs $600.00 which I dont have. Ideally I would buy a new( used but newer than mine ) but I have not worked since March 11th, 2016. I actually had a job offer at a company called Intelligent Staffing. My start date was Tuesday, 10/4/2016. The Monday morning before my orientation day, start day, my car would not start. I called a mobile mechanic. He came to my girlfriends house and replaced the fuel pump but the car still would not start. This mechanic started at 11:30am and worked until 3pm. He told me he would come back the next day to check my fuel line. I called I.S. explained to the owner that my car broke down that morning and its still not running so I would miss my orientation but I would call into the 10am meeting to listen to orientation and introduce myself. He seemed OK when we hung up. Feeling stressed out, I decided to stroll/roll up to Safeway and get some fresh air. When I was coming out of the grocery store I pulled my phone out to text my girlfriend. I noticed I missed a call/voicemail. Likely because my phone was muzzeled by my sweatshirt in my shoulder bag. It was the I.S. owner leaving a message @ 5:15pm. He said \"I talked with our COO, and we decided we are going to rescind your offer\". So the ONLY JOB OFFER I have had in the last 7 months was lost due to this bucket of bolts crappy car I have. I felt blindsided. But that car is NOT RELIABLE and unfortunately these people somehow knew my car was a wreck. Its not worth even $1,000 dollars. The WORST PART is, this is my weekend with my twin girls, age 6. But given my car now needs a water pump, I wont be seeing my girls this weekend......AT ALL. I split time between my moms home im Fairfax, CA & my girlfriends house in San Leandro, CA. If not for their generosity, I would be homeless right now. And without a running car, I have no idea if I can accept a new job offer unless its next to the BART train. I am stuck at my girlfriends house and I dont know when I will be able to go anywhere. Missing time with my kids is the worst part. They are just 6 years old and I have missed a LOT OF TIME with them due to my car trouble. I need to work and I need a car so I dont lose anymore. job offers. I wont have any kind of life with NO VEHICLE. I WOULD BE VERY, VERY, VERY GRATEFUL for a reliable vehicle. I pray to God my life will change soon. My wheelchair, chronic nerve pain and my age( 50 ) are big enough obstacles to over come. No car is an obstacle I cannot overcome. I implore anyone out there for help so I can buy a reliable vehicle and get back to work. I love my job which is ironically finding others jobs. Here I am a job expert who cannot find a job. Karma is real and good deeds do not go un-noticed. God bless anyone helping those in need. This world needs more kindness, more love and more understanding. We need love. Not hate. Generosity is a loving gesture. People with big hearts and kindness will be rewarded always. I have never asked for help like this. But I had to really humble myself and be realstic with myself. I have a 2001 car with 165k miles. I have a wheelchair that is 15 years oldGiven how difficut its been finding and keeping work, I have to do this. I have to do this for my twin girls. I have to do this for my girlfriend. I have to do this for ME. As an aging paraplegic, I am not the prototype employee lard companies look for. In fact I deal with discrimination with my disability and more recently my age. Ageism is the most prominent discrimination out there. As I get older, finding open minded companies becomes more diffiult. I appreciate any help. I truly do appreciate the generosity people often show. My life has been a challenge and extremely humbling. I rarely ever ask for help from anyone. But thats where I am now. I need help. I wil forever be grateful if I can buy a reliable car. God bless anyone who believes in helping others- John H'),\n",

       "  \"Please Help My Blind Son to See With SoundWe are not a family who likes to ask for help, but when an opportunity to improve my sons quality of life came up, I knew this was not an opportunity to let pass by. Unfortunately, though, at the same time I had to be honest with myself in knowing we couldnt do this alone.Just over 13 years ago, my son - Kevin Lowe - was diagnosed with a brain tumor. I cant begin to explain the rush of emotions that overtook me as the doctor explained everything to us, including the fact that the tumor had completely encased his pituitary gland and was pressing against both his carotid artery and his optic nerve.The shock of this discovery finally explained Kevins many health issues, such as the severe migraine headaches that had plagued Kevin since he was a toddler, and the slowly diminishing eyesight that was lost forever when the tumor was removed.The years since have not been easy. I have watched my son lose his independence, lose his friends, lose the things that he had always loved. He has had to standby as his dream truck and four wheeler were eventually sold, ultimately closing an independent chapter of his life.But you know what, through it all Kevin has woken up each day with a smile on his face and has found his way through the darkness being sure to give all the credit to his unwavering faith. Kevin began receiving orientation and mobility training after losing his eyesight, but it was always based upon learning a fixed route that would take him from point A to Point B and back again. This is fine for navigating his way in places that he is familiar with, but for those that he is not, it can pose a challenge. I have seen where this has limited my sons independence in his attempt at living a normal life despite his blindness.Recently we learned of a 501(c) (3) Non-Profit organization in California headed by Daniel Kish called World Access For The Blind (WAFTB) that is teaching blind persons of all ages to see with sound. Their scientifically-proven FlashSonar - a specialized form of human echolocation - in combination with their pioneering full-length cane training and No Limits philosophy, has enabled thousands of blind persons to achieve what they call Perceptual Freedom.\\n\\nOnce thought to be something only dolphins and bats could do, FlashSonar involves making sharp clicking sounds with the tongue on the roof of the mouth. WAFTB has partnered in scientific research that has proven the returning echoes reflecting off surrounding objects activate or light-up the brains visual cortex - the area used for seeing - creating acoustic imagery that enables a blind person to see in a new way.The life-changing results enable blind persons to break-free of a well-intentioned guiding arm, or traveling just between point A and point B, and other cycles of isolation and dependence to live a more self-directed life of independence, achievement and dignity.What a monumental impact and blessing that would be for Kevin. We have a chance for him to do one-on-one training with WAFTB Perceptual Navigation Instructor Brian Bushway over a week in June, and follow-up training in the future, but we need help in covering the training and travel costs for the first phase which, unfortunately, aren't covered by insurance. \\n\\nKevin is very excited to have a chance to train with Brian, who was also formerly a student himself at WAFTB who went on to obtain his Orientation and Mobility degree as well as a Master's degree in Special Education.You can learn more about Brian's journey in the video aboveand see why, in the video below, he's such an inspiration to Kevin because of his work with a student named Rob who journeyed from Wales to Los Angeles in search of the same 'Perceptual Freedom'.And you can learn more about the breadth and scope of the work done globallyby World Access For The Blind in the video below.\\n\\nYou can also learn more about WAFTBat their website .If there is any amount of money that you would be willing to donate to help make this trip possible so that Kevin can receive this life-changing training, we would be so grateful.We thank you in advance for any help you might be able to offer.God Bless!\"),\n",

When asked why she wanted to participate in Miss Springfield, her answer was simply, \"For my kids.\" Anyone that knows her, knows that statement refers to every single child in the foster care system, that Kelsey will claim as \"her\" kids, to give them a sense of belonging. Kelsey has such a passion for spreading awareness about the absolute need for foster families and adoptive families in not just the Springfield region, but all over Missouri. In Springfield, she\\'s involved in multiple Foster Care organizations, holds a job working as a residential specialist at a residential facility for children with behavioral disorders, and is a visiting resource to two children in the Foster Care system. Kelsey is also very involved in Children\\'s Miracle Network, Miss America\\'s national philanthropy. CMN offers funds to children needing hospital treament, travel expenses, and equipment expenses. She visits local pediatric wings to spend time with these children and their families regularly. Being Miss Springfield, she has the opportunity to compete in Miss Missouri, a preliminary for Miss America. There are five categories to be judged: Evening Wear, On-Stage Question, Interview, Talent, and Swimwear. Miss Missouri does come at quite a high expense. Between wardrobe, fundraisers for her platform issue, travel expenses, talent coaching, and music expenses, it adds up. Kelsey is a student at Missouri State University, taking 16 credit hours, working two jobs, and volunteering over 30 hours a week doing appearances and working with different foster care organizations and Children\\'s Miracle Network.This fundraiser is to help get Kelsey to Miss Missouri. Giving a donation would help jumpstart Kelsey into reaching her end goal: Becoming Miss Missouri, and spreading awareness for the children that mean so much to her. Your donations will not only help Kelsey, but help children in the foster care system, and children benefitting from Children\\'s Miracle Network.EVERY donation ensures a signed autograph card from Kelsey and a personal note. $50-signed autograph card, personal note, appearance from Miss Springfield for any event at your request. $100 or more-signed autograph card, personal note, appearance from Miss Springfield for any event at your request, & and plaque, thanking you or your business for your sponsorship.'),\n",

I (Nessa) recently was sued by Capital One for a credit card that I defaulted on several years ago, I was taken to court and must now pay them monthly or have any future earnings and tax refunds garnished. I recently got a job, however the constand standing on concrete and physical nature of the job caused a serious tendon issue in my left foot which left me unable to put weight on it. My employers tried to be understanding but their patience was limited and I was let go. This happened after less than 2 weeks on the job. Adding to that I failed my last semester of classes which means I owe my college the tuition and the government the cost of the grants I was given for that session. Joel recently had the same thing happen but for him not only does he owe the school and the government, but also the VA for their financial assistance. On top of all of this we still have the alterations to pay for on the dresses for my sister's wedding, the trip to and from Wisconsin, and of course our usual bills.So now we have no real way to continue to pay off the last few things for the wedding. Most of the big things are already taken care of. My dress is bought, his tux is rented and paid in full, the venue is paid for. We still need to pay our photographer, we need to pay for some of the basic food and drink, we need to pay for the PA system so there will be music, and alterations need to still be made to my dress. The only way to accomplish this would be to take out a small personal loan and plunge ourselves further into debt which is kind of the exact opposite thing that we wanted when we decided to get married. I still find this to be a frivolous use of this service. We aren't dying, our bills will still be paid, we won't lose our house. We just need a little help getting over the hump to make our day happen, to create memories with our family and friends. If you are like me, see things like this and roll your eyes to the sky and move on, Icompletely understand. I wouldn't even be doing this if it hadn't been suggested by numerous people and the idea supported by a close friend. If you can donate please do. If you can't, that's fine too. I would rather have you show up to the wedding with a smile on your face and a hug than pay money and resent me for asking this of you all.From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for even clicking the link to read this. Any funds we receive will go directly to wedding expenses. Any funds above and beyond what is needed to finish paying it off will go towards allowing us to get out of town and enjoy our freshly minted marriage and pay off a few bills.\"),\n",

My mom and my baby sister would love to be able to see him get married, but we are strapped for cash. Recently, my mom had a really nasty fall that shattered her left arm. It disabledher from working, and as a widowed mother running a day-care out of her home while trying to make it on her late husbands pension, it has been rough. Since the accident, her income has diminished and it has been a struggle to get by. It has been slow getting new clients (children to watch) now that she is again able to work. She just told me today that shes been painting a neighbors fence with her good arm in order to get $50 a day. She is such an incredible woman, always putting others first and doing so with a smile. I wish I could help her, but as a recent college graduate staying with friends as I look for that next level job, I am unable to help and it breaks my heart.

You see, both of us are in our 40s and both of us had written off the notion of finding love again. The thing is, we both have big hearts and a ton of empathy to go around. Those of us born with that affliction tend to gravitate toward nonlucrative careers. Naturally, we both work for a nonprofit organization called Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles (spcaLA). In fact that's where we met. We were both volunteers with the organization and were subsequently hired one month apart. Kris is a behavior and training specialist whose responsibities include the training, enrichment, socialization, and mental/emotional well-being of the animals that enter our shelters. I'm a humane educator. I hold anti-violence, empathy-based programs for adolescents at schools in at-risk environments. One of these programs is a court mandated weekend juvenile delinquent program for youths who have commited acts of animal cruelty. Another one is a middle school elective course on Humane Education with a dog training component where students learn to train dogs, using only positive methods. I am not telling you this to bore you, but to let you know that although my job is deeply rewarding, it comes with a nonprofit salary. All my jobs seem to have this issue. Before this, I was a social worker for disabled adults, and, before that, a middle school teacher.Kris and I live paycheck to paycheck with our three dogs and whatever animals we are fostering at the time. We know a lot of good people that are helping us with our small wedding. We have also been doing our best to save all we can. With some creative planning, we are getting closer to reaching our wedding goals. However, at this time, a honeymoon is out of the question.We are requesting help in our wedding funding shortfalls and a nice, relaxing honeymoon.

On a warm sunday evening in the summer of 2004 we were out for a walk when we both quietly realized we felt something beyond friendship for one another. We fell in love.The ten years that followed were rife with drama-- dating and breakups and secret holiday kisses. In spite of all the ups and downs we never stopped caring deeply for one another, even if we weren't talking for a time.As we grew older we went our separate ways but fate wasn't done with us yet:In 2014 I moved into a new apartment just a few streets aways from where Dexter was living (though we didn't know it at the time). My first morning in the new city I was in a car accident. Having no friends or even aquaintances in the area, I called Dexter, who rescued me from a frigid and lonely parking lot. The next night, I invited him over to watch a movie and gave him the choice of what we were to watch. He (of course) chose one guaranteed to make me cry (and therefore need consoling and cuddles). Over the next few weeks, we rekindled our friendship and it quickly grew into something more. It didn't take long for us to realize we wanted to be together forever. On a cold evening in December, Dexter proposed to me in my home with my family. I said yes, and, come August 1st, we will spend the rest of our lives together like we always wanted to.\"),\n",

Short, sweet, and straight to the point: I am moving to England in September as an intern and full-time missionary with the House of Prayer, Europe. It\\'s still completely crazy to see myself type those words, and I can hardly even believe it\\'s true.If you have heard of or have had any experience with the International House of Prayer in Kansas City, Missouri then you have a decent idea of what the framework of this next season of my life will look like. The specifics, however, are unique to the body at Bethshan Church in Sunderland, England, and to the culture that exists in that region of the world.I am going to give my life to the poor and broken of the Northeast of England.To care for and disciple women and girls who come from various crisis situations.To reach out to primary and secondary aged children within their own schools- many of whom have never even heard the name of Jesus.To build relationships with university students and bring them into the community and family of Bethshan.To step out and share the Gospel on the street through outreach with the church\\'s many missional communities.To commit my time, energy, and resourses to focused intercession that ushers in revival and allows God\\'s people to look upon His goodness and love \"in the land of the living\" (Ps. 27:13).And above all, to worship. Over the next few years, we plan to have the House of Prayer fully staffed to host a movement of 24/7 prayer and worship in Europe. My role is to be one of the few that go ahead to lay the foundation of leadership in that house for the ministry to grow and thrive.I am going to give hope, to give life, and to give myself. To change an atmosphere, that changes a culture, that changes a country, that changes the world through a generation raised as an army of worshipers of God.My plane ticket has already been provided for, so the purpose of this fundraiser is to finance my year living in England- paying for food and bills- while I use my time and energy solely to serve and to pray.It\\'s an honour to invite you to be a part of this ministry and this journey alongside me.

It was an awesome experience to be on the other side of adoption (we met so many great children in desperate need of families.) During my time in China I felt lead to adopt a boy (we had already worked on our paperwork and we were ready to send it off to China the week I returned home.. our request was for another girl.) We received information about a little boy with cleft lip and palate and the rest is history. We brought our son Bennett home in December of 2014.\\n\\nWhile in China we were able to meet some amazing children with both cleft lip and cleft palate (a special need near and dear to my heart since both of our children have cleft.) Without special bottles some of the children may not be able to drink their formula properly. This year America World (ACT) is teaming up with Hayden's Smile to provide cleft bottles and nipples for the children in orphanages and in foster care in China. I will be heading back to China in October. Will you join me on yet another amazing trip to China? Will you help me be a story teller for these precious children?\\n\\nIf you do not feel comfortable donating online, please contact me!All funds raised will be put towards travel and towards the cleft bottles and nipples. Thanks once again!\"),\n",

       "  \"Our chapel of Saint Francis in Jackson, NJ is the center of our ecumenicalministries, including free nursing home ministries, free Christian counseling, and ministries to the homeless, as well as weddings, funerals and music ministries on a free will offering basis. Unfortunately, our building is in a residential zone and due to its size does not meet the public requirements for tax exempt status as a Church.   The property taxes have more than doubled in the last 10 years and currently cost $7500 annually. Since Fr. Davidson is retired, his fixed income puts him well below the poverty level. The irony of the situation is that Franciscans typically spend most of their time ministering to the needy, and rarely have wealthy friends. While there is no monthly mortgage payment , the tax arrears are currently threatening to cause a foreclosure, forcing us to forfeit our property, his home, and consequently, access to the various ministries to which we have been called in our community for many years.  Please help us pay the property taxes so that we may continue answering God's call to minister to the poor and needy in Ocean and Monmouth Counties, and tell your friends about us.If you have been blessed by God through the ministries of Franciscan Servants of God's Grace, please share your experiences with us.____________________________________________________________SHARED EXPERIENCES:I have known Fr. Richard for 3 years now. He is holy man of God, and he needs our help. He has been invaluable to me and I dont know what I would do without him. He has taught me to trust in God and not focus on myself, and I know he has helped a lot of other people, too. He has never charged me or turned me away because of an inability to pay. In my current financial condition I could not afford to pay for therapy through traditional means, and I certainly cant afford to pay his taxes, but honestly, if I had it, I would give it to him. He ministers to whoever God calls him to help, and never gives a thought to money. Unfortunately, this means he usually ends up giving away his considerable expertise for free. As a result, he is a far better priest than a businessman, and even though he has almost nothing, he continually gives away his resources to those he perceives to be in need, to the neglect of his own needs.If we dont help him now to show our appreciation for what he has done for us, I dont know what will happen to him.John CapuanoAbout 3 years ago Fr. Richard and I were singing at a Christmas Eve service at Trinity in Red Bank. After the service it was about midnight and we were both hungry. We found that the only place open was the Irish pub about a block away. We went in together looking for something to eat, me in street clothes and him in his habit. The place was doing a brisk business. We didn't get as far as the bar before someone stopped him and asked him for some advice. I sat at the bar waiting for him and within minutes the man next to me began to confide in me that he was going through some difficult times and was really in need of some emotional support and some good advice . Not being religious, that man wouldn't have gone to clergy with the questions he was asking me, and the one who had approached Fr. Richard probably didn't even notice that I was there. I have seen on many occasions that when the two of us are together, God shows up. Divine appointments, he calls them. We were just looking for some food and found that it was really important for us to be there when we were there, because two people really needed us there at that moment for them.Miracles. They have become commonplace to me. I have learned to expect them. I have also learned that perhaps the most effective way to minister for God is to just get out of the way. I have grown spiritually more under his tutelage than from all the Bible classes in all the Churches I have ever been in. Although many would look at my life and see failure, I have learned, like Paul, to be content in whatever circumstance I am in, and also that the things I have are worth far more than the things I lack. The greatest joy I have known is having the sense of being used by God in miraculous ways, and He has given me eyes to see. It is difficult to know what to say that would help others understand the importance of the work that Fr. Richard does, but I know what it has meant to me. I can only say that in my view there is no cause more worthy of your financial assistance than his.In Christ,Greg Hartline Father Richard is someone whom I have known for less than a year now, and yet in this short time I have developed a deep level of respect and admiration. We met after either a rehearsal or the performance of a God and Country patriotic concert led by Nancy Scharff at King of Kings church in Middletown. We met again several times throughout the summer by the fact that we were both participating in the annual Choir Fest on Gods green acre in Ocean Grove, NJ. We both share a love of singing to the glory of God, especially when surrounded by over 900 voices. Our acquaintanceship developed into a friendship through a mutual friend, and as the months went by we have performed together more frequently, and I have had the honor to witness Father Richard in his element, sharing the gifts that God has given him with all whom he comes in contact. While I am not currently a regular member of the choir at Trinity Episcopal Church in Red Bank, NJ, I have sung there several times this past winter. Father Richard sings there and has an additional gift which he shares in his musical ministry with his skill as an organ builder, particularly in voicing the organ for optimal sound quality. He has retired from the profession of organ building and yet freely gives his time and skill in organ voicing, working with the resident organist Allan Robinson, to assure that the music heard during services is at its optimal best to enhance the worship experience of the attending congregation and visitors. This gift he has given freely has saved that church thousands of dollars, and it brings joy to the organist and the choir to hear the fruits of his labor in the voicing of the organ. People watching may sometimes have a negative connotation, but having the opportunity to watch Father Richard interact with others is inspiring and meaningful. He is such a kind and loving person. Despite his physical limitations, he always smiles and shares his humor with everyone. He is always willing to counsel anyone in need at the drop of a hat. Whether its while grocery shopping, going to the bank/ post office, at a restaurant, or after services, it doesn't matter. These divine interventions happen daily. Many times he finds himself at the right place and time to help someone desperately in need, and its amazing to see that it usually happens in places he hadn't planned to visit. But he was meant to be there to help those whom he has helped with compassion and prayer. His gift of counseling has been shared with the community in His time and when they were in need. It is difficult for me to put concisely into words, all of the things I have seen in the time I have known Father Richard, but I will say that no other friend of mine gives so freely of himself to help others. I know of no one else within whom the spirit moves so evidently. In everything that he does for those in need around him, he asks for nothing in return. I know of no one else more deserving of help with the taxes so unjustly mandated. Please pray about it, and if you are able, ask God to help you find an amount that you can contribute to help this wonderful servant of Gods grace.In Christs Love,Holly HartlineI haveknown father Richard for at least 18 years. He is a wonderful man.  He's a good Christian.  He helps people when in need and he's been there for me when   I needed help.He's also helped other people in his ministry.  He's passionate and understanding. I'm begging when people read this message that you please help him because he's a man of God and he's doing the Lord's work.  Again please helphim so we can keep his ministry going please. Donate whatever you can. Thank you .Roger Downing   I have known Fr. Richard Davidson for more than 20 years. When I first met him, he was a lay member of an Episcopal church. I watched him respond to the call to become a Franciscan and observed the changes in him as he began, more and more, to live Franciscan spirituality. I was there when he was ordained a deacon. The presence of the Holy Spirit was not only palpable to me but evident to almost everyone who attended. Many remarked upon it. I was present at his subsequent ordinations as well. I did nursing home ministry with him for a number of years at Country Manor Nursing Home in Toms River (now defunct). I served as his lay reader, altar server, and prayer partner.Fr. Richard served several other nursing homes as well. Although nursing homes have become a smaller part of his ministry, he still continues to do nursing home ministry on a monthly basis. Fr. Davidson is a Franciscan priest and founder of Franciscan Servants of Gods Grace. Although he says he is retired, he continues to give all of his strength and energy to whatever God calls him to. Except for building church organs and loudspeakers, every other ministry he does is at his own expense. Fr. Davidson was ordained in the Anglican tradition by Bishop David Guthmiller, a bishop in the Holy Ecumenical Anglican Catholic Church. Two other bishops  a bishop with Roman Catholic apostolic lines and a bishop with Eastern Orthodox apostoliclines laid hands on him at his ordination. With Bishop Guthmillers permission, he was subsequently ordained a minister in the free Baptist tradition. I attended all three ordinations  deacon, priest, minister. Why so many ordinations? It became obvious as soon as he began nursing home ministry that Fr. Richard has been called to an ecumenical ministry. Most of the residents who came to the services we conducted were Roman Catholic. However, when Fr. Richard invited one resident to come join us, she said, Oh no, I cant. Im Presbyterian. After hearing that he was a Baptist minister as well as a priest, she came to the service and quickly became one of our regulars. Fr. Richard is a gifted counselor. I know some of the people he has counseled and have observed the growth  and, in some cases, the major transformation  in their lives, through the grace of God poured out through this man. When my mother was in her final illness, he traveled out of state with me several times to visit her in various hospitals. For decades, she had sought the divine in Eastern religions and Native American spirituality. I had tried for years without success to introduce her to Jesus. Fr. Richard explained the gospel to her in a way that broke through all the      bad theology and misconceptions that had driven her away from Christianity. From what she said to me before she died, I am convinced that she died a Christian. Fr. Richard is also a talented amateur singer who sings weekly with a church choir. He also sings special concerts, throughout the year, with various other choirs and choral groups. You may have seen him at Choir Fest in Ocean Grove. Fr. Richard exemplifies the lack of materialism for which the Franciscan order is known. He lives frugally. Although his income puts him below the poverty line,he doesnt hesitate to share his meager resources with friends or strangers who are in need. He has repeatedly opened his home to people who otherwise would not have had a roof over their heads. He has allowed them to live with him for months and, in several cases, years. In this increasingly secular world, he is a truly counter-cultural figure  a man for whom no part of his life is secular but all, to the best of his ability, offered to God. Fr. Richard is the real deal. I am grateful for my longstanding friendship with Fr. Richard. I am amazed by his many talents and in awe of the ways God uses him in so many ministries. I was a candidate in Franciscan Servants of Gods Grace but realized that the life of a Franciscan sister was not for me. Yet, having tried to live as a Franciscan, I can see more clearly than most how much the vow of poverty has become central to Fr. Richards life. Although I have given him what I could and will continue to give as I am able, I cannot pay his taxes. I hope that you who read this will help to do so. If Fr. Richard loses his home, his ministry will have to cease, to the detriment of many people. You can help prevent this.Yours in Christ,Janet BirckheadIt was several years agowhen Imet Fr. Richard ata Steve Lonegan campaignrally, when Steve was running for the Senate in New Jersey. As a Secular Franciscan, I was impressed to learn that hewas a Franciscan priest and was involved with the Coalition of Judeo-Christian values: Faith, Family, and Freedom and several other organizations that I was very interested in myself. After campaigning for Steve Lonegan, we worked together on many various religious and political events  including celebrating the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity; the National Day of Prayer; participating in a monthly prayer meeting for the state government of New Jersey at the Trenton State House; and many other similar programs.Fr. Richard has demonstrated many times how his deep love and faith in God has moved him to take action to assist in reforming our political system and culture to the ideals set forth in the Bible. He is very passionate, zealous and dedicated to the work God has given him. As a Franciscan Servant of Gods Grace, Fr. Richard never puts limits on what God asks him to do. For Fr. Richard serving God is not a 9-5 job, not a business proposition. He is on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Fr. Richard is a tireless worker in the Lord's vineyard, always ready and willing to serve. Fr. Richard has opened his home to the homeless on several occasions, at great inconvenience to himself. He welcomes anyone that God puts in his path and offers the Gospel message of love, mercy, compassion, kindness, faith and hope to all.He is doing Gods work and puts his own needs last. He is now forced to confront his own needs because the bank is threatening to foreclose his home. He is reaching out for help at this urgent time. Please be generous to Fr. Richard, a servant of God who needs help to continue his divine mission. Pax et bonum,Dorothy OReilly, OFS I am writing this proclamation of truth in regard to what I know of Father Richard F. Davidson, my friend, mentor, and Father in the faith. Is he a great teacher, is he holy and pure, doeshe follow Christ?  If you dont know there is not any need in reading this. All of the things I have stated above I shall prove in my following statements. We shall see if the above be true as well. It should be true in all Servants of God!  Father Richard was put to test in all aspects of the faith before me in my two years of residence in his home while recovering from a near fatal attack of complete neuropathic nerve failure, TSD, herniations of 1/3 of my disks and severe intestinal dysfunction caused from parasites picked up from foreign countries. He began to teach me not by reading or quoting, but by living. He lessons were humility first in dealing with a totally sick man in his private residence. Him being a very private man since the passing of his wife had become a Franciscan Servant of Gods Grace. Now a very injured, dysfunctional and sick man had entered his world. I observed him to be always busy with PEOPLE, counseling those not of his parish, but anyone who called and needed to talk. To the wee hours of the morning I listened as he patiently imparted courage, hope and faith over the phone to a number of different people who were desperate or just plain lonely. He would rise early in the morning and be off to either be finishing an organ system he would build from scratch, even the electronics and making his own cross-overs to insure the sound was exactly matched to the system and the house of worship. Occasionally he would even do work forgreedy self-centered organizations, which to my liking are as phony as the day is long, and then not be paidhis hard labors. He loved building these sanctified machines of magnificent sound. I would go over with Brother Ron to listen to their finished product. Ron is a well accomplished organist and friend of the Servants of Gods grace.  He teaches all by his actions of love faithfulness and kindness. I have read in the Holy Word of God that perfect love casts out all fear. That love covers a multitude of sins. I have learned by Father Richard that perfection and Holiness come from a love, I believe, Americans have forgotten. Greater love hath no man than that he lay down his life for his friends. Does this mean one time or is it greater to have laid down your own desires to love your friends and family every day?  Father Richard allowed me to store my things in his house and take a spare bedroom to continue the editing of all the film I had shot while with CNN, ESPN, TURNER, WMCN, and more to make DVDs that would be a help to veterans and others in developing their inventions. First I was hospitalized at the VA Hospital in East Orange, New Jersey and ridded of the parasites, then later had obtained a drink called Nopalia that enabled me to walk on my feet again. I began to walk more and more until I was getting around much better. The winter would torture me such that I could not sleep. He never put a yoke of tension or what I should do on my shoulders, which may have killed me. The VA only now, five years later after letting me suffer and even once again leaving me for dead, is taking notice! I began to come back to life enough to be able to move to Florida while seeking what I was entitled to 40 years ago. Have mercy as we have been shown mercy. Father never required either I pay rent or bethrown to the street. Did he sit with me and gossip about his friends and speak all manner of evil about them?No, we talked about science, his latest project, politics, current events, his latest TED Speaks video, engineering, language and religion. He made his friends my friends and I was healed emotionally on a first round. I learned it is not the church congregation, but the heart of those where you are.  I ask you now, if you have been moved in your heart to help support the continuing ministry of Fathers counseling, trips to the hospital, nursing home ministries, volunteering in the Ocean Grove Choir, the Trinity Church Choir, and the Garden State Philharmonic Chorus.  Please contribute what you can.Yours in Christ,Richard R. Langley\"),\n",

That means it is nearly 85 years old! It was built in 1930 and was located behind the sauna for nearly 50 years before it was moved to its current location near the playground. It has witnessed weddings, marriage proposals, Bible studies, choruses of angels singing for Christmas in July, character announcements throughout games of Inherit the Kingdom, and too many staff meetings to count. Many of us have fond memories of the picturesque gazebo and it is difficult to think of replacing it. But its time to honor the original gazebo (and the many gallons of paint that currently hold it together) and plan for the future.Plans for a new gazebo are in the works and contractors are on board to build it this fall so it can be dedicated at the 85th Anniversary Celebration June 7, 2015. The new gazebo will be larger so it can be used as another summer programming site, but it will maintain the original gazebo appearance. Now, guess what? YOU GET TO HELP!Every current and former FLLC staff member is invited to participate in Gazebo-nanza! As a way of honoring the past and Driving Faith Forward (the 85th Anniversary motto), we invite you to prayerfully consider a monetary donation that will help build the new gazebo.The goal is to raise enough money between June 8 (summer program begins) and August 8 (summer program ends) to completely pay for the construction. In exchange for an $85 donation, your name and the year(s) you worked at FLLC will be inscribed on the ceiling of the new gazebo for present and future generations to see! (You may also reserve a piece of the old gazebo to keep for yourself!)If you can afford to be even more generous, for a gift of $850, your name can be inscribed on one of the new gazebos supportive pillars! More than one persons name can be listed on a pillar or section of the ceiling, so you might want to plan a joint gift with other Fortune Lake friends. Gifts in memory or in honor of someone who worked at camp are also welcome. These gifts will be recognized during the dedication service.Weve made it easy for you to contribute. Simply follow the instructions on thisGoFundMe.com web page to make your donation online. In the comments section, PLEASE LIST THE NAME(S) AND YEARS WORKED AT CAMP AS YOU WANT THEM TO APPEAR ON THE GAZEBO.\\n\\nYou may also choose to mail your donation directly to Fortune Lake Lutheran Camp to ensure that every single penny go towards building the gazebo. This site charges a minimal fee to process credit card transactions, so some of the donation money will be used to pay for the use of this site. Checks can be mailed to 138 Fortune Lake Camp Road, Crystal Falls, MI 49920.\\n\\nRemember, you have until August 8 to make your contribution to this ground-breaking milestone in Fortune Lake history.

Our goal in Ecuador is to provide our environmental service work of reforestation of the Ecuadorian countryside, deliver public education, develop a garden for Baird High School, and build leadership, relationship, technical, and global citizenship skills that will give us the tools we need to be successful later in life. GSE's goal is to plant 25,000 trees and restore 110 acres of tropical dry forest, and this year we plan to plant between 1,500 and 3,000 native trees and mangroves to help reach our overall goal.If you want to learn more about GSE click on this link:  http://www.globalstudentembassy.org/exchange-programs/high-school-programs/ecuador-highschool-exchange-program/This trip is a once in a lifetime opportunity and will teach my peers and I so much that we will bring back home and share with our peers at Drake High School and with our larger Marin County community. But I need your help!My goal is to raise $2,500 by the end of March, 2015, to pay for the cost of my trip. Your support would be very kind and all money will go towards the trip to Ecuador.You can donate any amount of money here on gofundme,or send a check if you prefer, (contact me for my address.) I appreciate any amount of money you are willing to donate to help me reach my dream of traveling to Ecuador and making a global difference. Thank you so much!\"),\n",

       "  \"My name is Billy D. MOORE and I have stage 4 metastatic melanoma. My cancer is incurable and inoperable. I have 4 tumors on my liver. I am going through chemotherapy, things are not getting better but not getting worse....for now. My wife of 11 months works part time only so she can be home with me and our finances are always tight...that's the nice way to explain them. I got my diagnosis 29 days after our wedding (Aug. 11, 2012). We hadn't even been on our honeymoon yet. This is the second time I've had cancer, in 2004, a year after my daughter was born I lost my left eye. That cancer was called ocular melanoma. I was cancer free for 8 years and thought I was free and clear. My daughter is now a beautiful nine year old! I am creating this site in hopes that I could get some financial support for medical bills and daily living expenses but also I have a dream to see YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK before I die. There is so much I want to see and do but it all seems so out of reach right now. I know my time here is short and I want to make the most of it. I want my daughter to have fond memories of this time. Quality of life is so important. We pray for miracles but we know God has it all planned out and we need to accept his plan as hard as it is. If our story touches you and you want to donate, I thank you in advance. Either way may God Bless you and yours.PEACE,BILLY\"),\n",

So, when this opportunity came up recently, I saw it as a chance to at least be able to let Hylah experience some of the outside world as the trip will be traveling through France then to Barcelona.The goal is to raise $3,500 (the current cost of the tour) by March in order to participate in the trip.Hylah is a very involved and enthusiastic student. She's been a 4.0 and Honor Roll student throughout Middle School and is now also finding her stride as a Sophomore. She's participated in music since Elementary School (Cello, Viola, Saxophone, Percussion), played live in Disneyland with her Middle School Orchestra and Symphonic Band as well as with her High School Orchestra as a Freshman last year. In her last 2 years of Middle School, she was an ensemble player in 2 school play productions and volunteered as a crew member for a 3rd production after graduating Middle School. She's done volunteer work with a couple local organizations. She also has been playing softball (primarily as a catcher) for the last 7 years in local recreational leagues and travel teams as well as joining her High School team last spring. So, I couldn't think of a better way to reward her for all of her efforts (academically and otherwise) than to let her meet new people, make new friends and see the world with this opportunity.Thank you all in advance!\"),\n",

This 3 month long expedition, spanning over 2,320 miles and passing through 10 states, will be an important journey of self-growth and discovery for us as individuals, and an opportunity to embody the raw pioneer spirit of American exploration.To help us get down the river, we will be floating on a lifetime friend, a Grumman canoe. However, we will need some more supplies if we hope to obtain the sweet taste of salt water splashing on our faces and the cool sea breeze at our backs. That is where you come in; any support you can provide will be greatly appreciated! Your generous donations will be used for gear, food, and transportation for our trip. Additionally, a portion of these funds will be donated to the Louisiana Outdoors Outreach Program (LOOP). LOOP provides positive, life-changing outdoor experinces for youth in Greater New Orleans, allowing them the opportunity to experience the diverse wetlands ecosystem of southern Louisiana.LOOP works with at-risk youth in Greater New Orleans to teach social-emotional growth through outdoor skills. Since 2004, LOOP has grown to serve between 2,000 and 3,000 area youth each year with close relationships amongst local schools and youth organizations. In addition to academic-year programming spanning canoeing, climbing, camping, fishing, and swimming, LOOP facilitates summer internships that equip high school students with technical skills to become employable outdoor professionals.Since its founding, LOOP has been supported through Louisianas Office of State Parks. This year, a state-wide budget deficit has severely decreased LOOPs staff and program capacity. Friends of LOOP graciously accepts donations to ensure New Orleans youth continue to benefit from life-changing outdoor programming. Please visit their website at  www.loopno.org for more information!We firmly believe outdoor education to be one of the most important aspects in youth development, and that is why we are tying our own personal journey to the development of New Orleans inner-city youth. Having lived in The Big Easy for the past four years, we understand the difficulty that many children face in getting out of the city and into the natural environment. Being immersed in nature holds a pivotal role in personal and emotional growth, and through this Mississippi River trip, we hope to not only grow independently, but also provide a means for others to do the same. When we float through the Big Easy in the final stage of our journey, we will personally volunteer with LOOP. We are so excited for this closing portion of our adventure, as it will allow us the opportunity to personally spark a passion and understanding for the outdoors, creating a space for personal growth for those who need it most. To chronicle this adventure, we will be maintaining a blog that will depict our day-to-day experiences on the river, and will also be creating a documentary style video at the end of the trip to fully explore the impact and scope of our journey. Also, through a Q&A portion of our blog we are planning to educate LOOP participants about the Mississippi River and wetland ecosystems, as well as teach wilderness survival skills and boat safety knowledge. This is a link to our blog.

LOOPLOOP INSTAGRAM LOOP FACEBOOK PAGE THE CREWEver since meeting in freshman year of college the two of us have always had a taste for adventure, and passion for the great outdoors . Whether it be chasing toothy Alligators through the swamps of Louisiana, or surfing with hungry sharks in Fiji, we have always been looking for that bigger, better, and crazier experience to test our grit, and skill in the outdoors. We are happy to say that after graduating from Loyola University New Orleans, we are ready to push our limits to the next level, and embark on the trip of a lifetime. Mitchell SelbyBorn in the year of 1992, Mitchell set out to explore the world and see what was waiting. His competitive swimming career in high school prepared him for a life of water sports. Mitchell earned the rank of Eagle Scout then completed a National Outdoor Leadership School course where he acquired the skills necessary to survive a blizzard, cross frozen rivers and navigate using map and compass. After his first year of college, he paddled and portaged through the Crown Lands of Ontario where he found his love for the great outdoors. He then returned to the city of New Orleans. Once he was back in the wild, concrete jungle of the Big Easy, he enrolled in a study abroad program in the country of Fiji where he caught wind of a pirate treasure that could only be found by deciphering the trickiest of riddles. As much as he wanted to spend his weekends in the library, he simply couldnt ignore the urge to solve the riddle and was enticed by the subtle warnings of deadly undertows, murky waters and sharks that stood between him and the treasure. After spending 3 months of surfing, sailing and scavenging the coasts of Fiji, Mitchell found the treasure that had been left behind by the Dread Pirate Malcolm. Once back from Fiji, Mitchell just couldnt shake the feeling of adventure but knew his next outdoor pursuit needed to be shared with others. Mitchell was able to track down the Dread Pirate Malcolm and proposed that they paddle their way through America and write about their adventure in hopes of helping others get outside. The two lads spent many nights planning out the trip and decided that they not only wanted to paddle the Mississippi River from source to mouth, but they wanted to inspire and empower others to do the same. They hoped to inspire others by leaving a blog and donating a portion of their budget to a non-profit organization that helps youth stay out of trouble by getting them into the outdoors. The duo decided upon a Louisiana organization called the Louisiana Outdoor Outreach Program which utilized the outdoor environment as a classroom to build upon academic, social and organizational skills for youth up to 18 years of age.Malcolm ReedAnavid adventurer and experienced canoeist, Malcolm feels most at home out in the woods, sleeping under the stars, or floating downriver in his beloved Grumman canoe. Having just graduated from Loyola University New Orleans with a bachelors in Business Management and a minor in Biology, he is readyto pursue his love for canoeing, and completely immerse himself in the natural world before moving out into the world. Through this adventure, Malcolm hopes to gain a broader perspective on America, as the Mississippi River is the artery into which much of the country's water, infrastructure, and culture flows. The ultimate goal of this trip for Malcolm is that of self-exploration and emotional development, as he wishes toadopt a piece of the pioneer spirit that has been lost in our interconnected society, and to explore one of the last truly wild and unpredictable pieces of the American landscape.Malcolm is also an artist, who has started his own t-shirt and design company, Malrkey. Mostly working in pen and ink mediums, Malcolm incorporates elements of nature and the world around him into chaotic depictions of his own thoughts and emotions. Through these drawings and illustrations, Malcolm hopes to chronicle the personal and emotional element of the trip, as well as document the raw beauty that the Mississippi River landscape has to offer.Our buddy Aaron sporting the Fleur-de-lis shirt (the FleurGear reward) down in the Big Easy.\"),\n",

The doctors say there was an unpreventable, rare infection in the placenta that caused her to go into early labor at17 weeks.As you can imagine, they are heartbroken and devestated. Having just moved back to Sebastopol to raise a family, they are now unsure what is next. Many members of the community have asked what they can do to support Amy and Issac in this tender time.  Prayers and loving energy sent their way are greatly appreciated. They are feeling overwhelmed and private at this time and may not respond to phone calls or emails, though theyquietly appreciate the support. This fundraiser is raising money tosupport our dear Amy and Issac so they may have a little time to grieve and reorient to what is next for them. Any amount helps hold them so they can have a few weeks to process and rest and not need to think about working. They have a road trip planned to the San Juan islands in the Pacific Northwest sometime this month, once Amy's body is healed from the birth. Perhaps these funds can help pay for gas, a retreat, a massage, or a nourishing meal along the way. Thank you for your generosity.\"),\n",

The photo for this page is of the three of us at the festival in 2015. I have been planning on going again this year for a while, but Kenzie had not been planning on going. After Dakota died, she told me she wished she was going with me. The festival is in two weeks and neither of us would be able to make the money to send her in that short time period.

       "  'Hi! I am Shelya Paz...I left communist Cuba 15 years ago to live here in the United States with the love of my life, a songwriter. I always wanted to be in the media but the Cuban government decided I should be trained as a teacher, instead. When I arrived here my husband encouraged me to follow my passion. So, I am self-taught as a social media journalist . I have been covering stories for my site, Entertainment Circle Network, which is part of my small, but blossoming bilingual Paz Communications, Inc. production company. Fast forward to now: I have been fortunate to be contacted by the White House and invited to travel with President Obama to Cuba March 19th to March 22nd, 2016. So, time is of the essence. This is a great honor but with that comes the reality of the exhorbitant expenses. I am racing against the clock to make that plane on Saturday and cover all the costs.As you can imagine, I must pay all the expenses myself. It is not cheap to fly with the president. I will be with the President Obama as an eyewitness to events and give first hand accounts of how the United States and Cuba are reconnecting to hopefully reopen doors to allow the Cuban people more freedoms. This is a crucial story in the history of my beautiful and previous homeland, Cuba. And, now, my beautiful new homeland, the United States, is creating opportunities for those struggling in Cuba to perhaps achieve their dreams. The United Stateshas afforded tremendous opportunities to me for which I am deeply grateful and I hope the same will happen for the 11 million living in Cuba.The travel costs are exorbitant and beyond my reach. But, I feel so strongly about covering this eventful trip that I have raised half of what it will take to travel there with the White House Press Corps. This is a true honor and one that I want to share with everyone. I will be posting numerous stories, first hand accounts and talking to everyone and anyone who want information about the developing relationship between the two countries. Please follow me on Entertainment Circle Network and talk to me directly via YouTube ( https://www.youtube.com/user/EntertainementCircle),Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and on online at  www.ecircletv.comI am a struggling business woman who had a dream and it is coming true. Now, I have this great opportunity to share a historic event. Please help me as I need to raise another $7,000 to cover all the costs of travel, communications, hotel and accomodations. Everything is exhorbitantly high priced. I have reached out to numerous friends, family, sponsors and acquaintances who have helped but I have now reached the moment where, if I do not raise this money, I fear I will need to abandon my plans.I hope you feel this is as important as I do because I will bring you the news and information, unfiltered, and from the point of view of someone who has lived on both sides. I am extremely grateful to you for reading this post. I will continue to post stories and information about this journey and hope you will become a part of this amazing moment in time.

       "  'First of all I would like to make clear that what I am announcing here is the most difficult situation I have ever had to put into words in my entire life.In October of 2009 along with one of my best friends, and a group of talented artists that later became family, opened the doors to Cornerstone Art Gallery. A platform for Low Brow art, primarily supporting the Las Vegas Tattoo and Graffiti community.Cornerstone Art Gallery since has strived to be a staple in the Las Vegas underground art scene and has given 100\\'s of artists a place to call home. But today, December 30th after a single selfless act, that all has changed...This morning we received a call from a neighbor informing us that our door looked broken into. We rushed over to the gallery to find the door had been pried open, and with shock and devastation we walked into a 100% EMPTY GALLERY! The feeling of seeing every wall striped from originals works of art leaving only behind the description and price tags of artist\\'s hard work behind is the worse feeling I could ever imagine. To have every single item stolen as a gallery owner with the faith and trust of artists to house, support and sell their art is indescribable. I am devastated, disappointed and embarassed that this has happened. This last year has been a really rough year for Cornerstone Art Gallery and for many others within the Arts District, with the closing of both Reclaime and Black Bird Studios as evidence. Along with all the issues facing First Friday concerning funding, downsizing and ultimately an undisclosed hiatus of the event as a whole, has truly made a negative impact on business and the support from the community. All of this along with today\\'s discovery is most certainly the nail in the coffin and death to an era of low brow art provided by Cornerstone Art Gallery. I am unfamiliar with asking for help. I have never used this platform of crowd funding, nor had a legitimate reason until today. We are asking the community to give us a helping hand in replacing a fraction of the artists loss at Cornerstone. Every single penny will go to the five artists affected by this theft. The artists are as follows and in no particular order: Nina Navarette, Jason Gruda, Noel Terracina, Joe Riley and Visual Bluff. Both Dana Anderson and myself had artwork and personal items stolen from the gallery as well but again we are asking for support of the artist,s thousands of dollars in works of art stolen.We have tremendous faith in our community to provide a helping hand for these original artists in their time of need. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING (YOU) DO HELPS ALOT! We encourage if you are in the position to donate to please find it in your hearts to do so. In addition to donations, some very important supportive elements that will go a long way is by SHARING our posts, goFUNDme links, and information. Getting the word out is as important as doantions, so by simpling SHARING THIS INFORMATION< YOU ARE HELPING in a major way. Another key element in helping these artists is to continually check Craigslist, OfferUp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter for \"ART FOR SALE\". Take a moment and get mentally familiar with these works of art so if you see them again we can catch the thieves that did this.Again asking for help is something I am not familiar with, but I am desperate to do all that I can to help these people I genuinely love, admire and respect... The one thing i am familiar with is SUPPORT! These artists SUPPORT me while I SUPPORT them, so I am asking YOU to PLEASE SUPPORT MEMBERS OF (OUR) COMMUNITY.Sincerly,Phillip Limon(Owner of Cornerstone Art Gallery)'),\n",

One of the most important and fun ways to promote an album is to create music videos. I created \"Somebody Call The Doctor\" by myself, and as much fun as it was to create, it took several months of my time, and now it\\'s time that I just don\\'t have because I\\'m writing new music, booking shows, and managing myself. It\\'s a lot of work, and I\\'d love to give an amazing videographer in the Bay area a chance to shine.

And the more exposure I have, the easier it will be for me to continue to create music for you AND it will help me get out on the road and tour.There are a lot of costs that go into making a music video. Beyond props, wardrobe, hiring a crew, a camera, lights, and actors, there are costs for editing, promotion, and distribution.Whatever we raise for the music video is what we will use. I\\'m all about quality over quantity.I plan on creating several music videos from the album. This GoFundMe will focus on one.And for helping with this video, your name will appear in the credits of the video. Contribute over $100 and I will give you a special shout-out at the end of the video!Thank you for continuing to believe in me, for supporting me, and aiding in creating music and art!

I love you guys. You continue to blow me away. So let\\'s set a stretch goal because 1) the bigger the funding, the bigger the video and 2) stretch goals are fun. So if we passour initial goal, everyone who has contributed so far AND everyone who contributes afterwards will get a private individual special video message/thank you from me. If you\\'ve donated over $100 you will still be personally thanked at the end of the video AND your private individual video message will have me doing something silly/fun/weird for you (just as long as it is not sexual or puts me in harms way).'),\n",

Did you know that there are over 8,000 children being raised by their grandparents (and great grandparents) in Brevard County, Florida alone? This is happening all over America.I can assure you this was not in the \"plan\" for these grandparents, but life sometimes throws us a curve ball. Drug abuse and domestic violence are two of the biggest reasons for this epidemic, but sometimes it is due to illness or death of the parent. Regardless of the reason, these childrenneed a place to call home that is safe and stable, and as you can tell by the news, they are often placed with relatives (typically grandparents). Grandparents Raising Grandchildren of Brevard County, Florida, Inc. (GRG) provides resources for these grandparents who don\\'t know where else to turn in this time of family crisis. In order to accomplish their important goal of \"The Child First\", GRG offers training courses, referral services, legal direction and funding, events for the kids, and most importantly support groups. There are pitfalls at every turn. For example, grandparents cannot even enroll the grandchildren in schools, daycare, or take them to the doctors and dentist without some form of guardianship or legal paperwork. Guardianship, Custody or Adoption requires legal representation and most of the grandparents that reach out to the GRG cannot afford these expenses. GRG provides funding for initial consultation and additional assistance with legal fees when it has the funding available. In this past year, the amount of services needed by grandparents seems to have skyrocketed. GRG does a phenomenal job with what they have, but like every non-profit agency, they need more. Give generously and help this group so the children can be legally protected in their new homes!Taxpayers are saved thousands of dollars in the long run when these children are kept out of foster homes. I am a \"card carrying member\" of this organization and have adopted two grandsons. I have witnessed first hand the wonderful job this organization does for the very needy and often terrified grandparent that walk through their door looking for guidance. Just imagine how different raising these children will be for these grandparents compared to when they raised their own children. Times are so different. Technology is overwhelming. The grandparents should be applauded for stepping in to take on this monumental job. They need our help and I am counting on you all to step up in whatever way you can. Every little bit will add up and your donations are tax deductible!If you were to poll your friends or coworkers, you would find that everyone knows someone who was raised by one or both of their grandparents. The need is real, and the need is great. These grandparents must be helped atthe most basic starting point, which is the obtaining of legal documentation so they can properly care for these children. GRG of Brevard is working tirelessly to not only help the local grandparents with this difficult job, but they are also working to change legislation to provide safe and stable homes for the children!Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and forconsidering helping out!'),\n",

I put this campaign together because Dave would never ask for contributions because he is humble. I can't think of a more deserving person and business. He will be ever so gratious and may even be so kind as to throw a party in the parking lot in the future (I'll provide the beer & it won't be that cheap stuff he likes)!One final note, for transparency, these funds will only be withdrawn by Dave Owens, owner of Mad Modern. On behalf of Dave and his family, thank you for your generosity!\"),\n",

I am a Playwright and I have owned Diamondnique Production Company since 2010 which is also located in Winston-Salem, NC. We write, direct & produce stage plays on a national level which have debut in Florida, North Carolina, Mississippi, Indiana, District of Columbia & New York but Winston- Salem, NC is home for me.My heart's desire is to re-open the old Ritz Theater which was originally opened in 1968 but has been left sitting for quite some time now. The building is in desperate need of restoration inside & outside in order to bring it up to code. The theater was a place where many residents would visit to watch their favorite movies & I am planning on doing everything within my power to re-open it This theater will be a venue which will be set up for live shows such as stage plays, concerts, poetry readings & comedy shows as well as big screen viewings of independent artist movies. This is a huge piece of history which needs to be restored for the simple fact that we are known as the City of Arts. With your help & the City of WS, I know that we can make this happen. Restoring history, designing jobs & providing an elegant platform is our goal.Thank you for your support & I pray that God will answer every one of your needs. I am looking forward to seeing everyone on the red carpet at the grand opening!Lizz Goins-TurnerDiamondnique Productions, CEO***For more information about Diamondnique Productions log onto  www.diamondniqueproductions.biz***\"),\n",

       "  'Established in 2002, Lest We Forget Slavery Museum (LWF) is the only Philadelphia area museum with actual slavery artifacts that reveal the history of how different coming to America was for enslaved Africans. Hundreds of shackles, manacles, branding irons and other forms of ironware are displayed throughout. Numerous Bill of Sale documents reveal how slaves were bought and sold like chattel property are on display. Also included, are a significant number of Jim Crow objects purposely created to negatively depict Negroes and further fan the fires of bigotry that led to lasting racist attitudes toward African Americans today. Several exhibits ranging from the capture of Africans to the emancipation of African Americans and the contributions they made in the building of America are included in the guided tours. This small-sized museum contains a huge amount of history not generally found in many history books raises visitors\\' level of consciousness and awareness. The exclusive LWF \"Killed by Others - Killed by Brothers\" exhibit provides a direct and disturbing correlation between violence dealt to blacks by others during and post slavery with the genocidal killings currently affecting many black communities by brothers today. LWF slavery museum reveals a dark and tragic period in American history while also shedding a positive light of understanding the value of this historic period and the knowledge it provides. The horrendous winter of 2013 wreaked havoc on the 18,000 square foot building which houses the 3,500 square foot LWF museum. As a result we are desperately in need of a new roof, electrical work and general repairs. Without the much needed funding LWF museum is in jeopardy of going away along with the display of rare artifacts and valuable knowledge we provide. Not only will the funding enable us to replace the roof and do other desperatelyneeded repair work to our building; a1950\\'s former rubber gasket factory, we will also be able to expand ourmuseum space and exhibit even more of ourgarnered collectibles and artifacts presently in storage. Without financial support we will be forced to close our doors indefinitely.Any amount of donation will be greatly appreciated and utilized as previously mentioned. We thank you for your consideration of our plea for financial assistance and hope that you will find our labor of love and gift of knowledge to the general public one worthy of your support.

It features some of the most popular acts on the legendary Motwon record label - a label that helped catapult Detroits unique music around the globe. Im also a music man, and put five months of time and energy into creating this piece, to properly honor the legend it represents.Schools have scheduled field trips to the mall just to see it, and I\\'ve even had a visit from the last surviving member of the Four Tops, Duke Fakir. I was humbled to hear Fakir say he came because he had heard so many great things about it.I created the piece so people could have a visual representation of the historical significance that Motown is to this city and state. Motown smashed walls and made history, but seeing this piece get smashed or painted over would be a tragedy.If there\\'s anything in my power that I can do to stop this from happening, Im gonna to do it. But with limiting funding and a ticking clock, I need support to save the mural. I\\'m reaching out to anybody or any institution who might be willing to help me get this mural out of the mall before it closes.I am hoping to get it placed into a museum, art gallery, or even with a private collector for personal display.

I went to facebook with my thoughts about it and some people reacted and are wanting to help out. Please read below for the facebook story. If you have any questions for me pleasecontact me through this website.If you would like to stop by and meet Thomas (someone who will absolutely inspire you by his hard work and life story) let me know and I will set it up. The funds will be given to Thomas not only to help him get on his feet with a vehicle but also from all of us who donate as a \"thanks\" for setting a standard as someone who works hard, everyday, no matter the circumstances presented. I have very much respect for this individual and hope I can just help him just enough to put a smile back on his face and get him headed in the upward direction. Him and his wife live in a motel on Valley Avewhile he gives as much as he can to his mother to help her renovate her house. For about a year now Thomas has sacraficed his living conditions so that he can help his mother get her house back to livable conditions.Posted 08/08/16 on Facebook:I want to share something with you all. I have an employee that walks to and from work everyday. He lives on Valley Ave near Jim Stutzman Chevy and reports to work in the Stonewall industrial park in Stephenson(north Winchester) at 8am every morning. This individual then leaves here at 4:30pm and heads over to his second job at Home Depot warehouse to be there at 6pm. He works there until midnight and then begins his trek home back to Valley Ave. This is nearly 12 miles round trip and the walking part takes almost 5 hours total. This is a man that doesnt complain, just does what he has to do because he has no other choice. Does his job as well as anyone and works very hard...A very respectful but timid person. The one who always stands up to lend an extra hand when others just walk away.Last Thursday night he was homeward bound at 12:00am from his second job. Around 12:30am he had just crossed thru the Loudoun Street mall and was headed south bound towards Valley Ave. He got one block south of the old town mall when he was hit with a metal trash can in the back of the head. A black male individual 22-24 years old told him \" I know you, give me your wallet..\" My employee put up a fight for as long as he could until a second individual popped out of a bush and sucker punched him in the side of the face knocking him out. By the good Lords graces, they didnt get his wallet and didnt severely injure him. Let me mention that the next morning, Thomas was at work at 7:45am, ready to go. I was not around much Friday to notice his swollen face.This morning (Monday) I mentioned something and learned the story of what happen. Its hard to keep my rage in. To see someone work so hard...and be beaten for what theyve earned by working. Sickening.He mentioned to me he was not interested in the trouble of getting the police involved as he will let God decide the fate of the 2 men who did this to him.'),\n",

Antonio was her brother. He was an artist and aspiring fashion designer. She then made up in her mind that she would do what she knew to help others in the community to expose them to things they could only dream of. Kala wanted to inspire them to go after their dreams. As a result, Fashion Against Violence was created. The Fashion Against Violence movement created\\na program for the youth in the Flint community called Fashioned with Purpose (FWP) in\\n2011. FWP is a program focused on developing the skills of individuals\\ninterested in Fashion and Art in urban communities. Our mission is to promote\\ndesigners and artists who thirst for opportunities in hopes to educate the\\ncommunity through exposure to the fashion industry.\\nIn 2013, Vehicle City Fashion Week gave Fashioned\\nWith Purpose a platform to educate and illustrate to individuals ages 12-18.\\nThese individuals were given the opportunity to learn basic fashion skills that\\npositively changed the way they present themselves in the world today. They learned\\neverything from proper undergarments with Victoria's Secret Stores, to how to\\nuniquely dress for life with President Tuxedo Stores. This program taught the\\nstudents how to confidently incorporate their individual style to fit into the\\nworld of everyday living. There was however one requirement for program\\nparticipation; all participants had to write a brief essay on how violence had\\naffected them directly. \\nStudents not only expressed how violence\\nhad played a role in their lives, but they also learned how their dreams paired\\nwith ambition could allow them to conquer various career opportunities in the\\nfashion industry. They were also given the opportunity to attend the Vehicle\\nCity Fashion Week Runway Show and worked with professionals in the industry to\\nproduce an actual design showcase. This program will prepare the youth in the\\ncommunity with skills and internship opportunities that can be used in their\\nfuture careers. This year we look to take this opportunity to New York City for\\nreal time experience in America's fashion capitol and we need you to accomplish\\nthis goal. \\nIn February 2014, we plan to take two young women from Flint, MI to New York City to attend\\nMercedes-Benz Fashion Week (Alexis Harvey and Alexis Neal). We know that two individuals is not a large number,\\nbut this is just the start of what will become a grand opportunity for youth in\\nour community.

Pat was a dear friend and colleague and her commitment to challenging herself physically, intellectually, and spiritually was an inspiration to all. She was an active and devout member of the Salem Baptist Church of Chicago who attended Prairie State College at night to earn her degree.  Sadly, she passed with only one class to complete to graduate.  Prairie, nonetheless, bestowed her with an honorary degree.  That's why in 2012, Patricia's family and co-workers at Clark Hill PLC provided the first donations to the Patricia Peggs Scholarship Fund for Adult Women ( www.ppsffaw.org).  It is the goal of the Peggs Fund to provide scholarships for women over 40 who are members of Salem to help them to earn their college degrees and to see their dreams come true. With Pat's spirit in mind, running the marathon presents us with the opportunity to honor her courage, perseverance, and optimism and do our part to make sure that her name and memory remain bright light in support of the efforts of others to reach their potential.  We look forward to your support of the Peggs Fund and, hopefully, seeing you along the Marathon route.\"),\n",

Hands To Love Hand Camp is a yearly gathering at Camp Crystal Lake in Starke, FL where families of children with limb differences can come together for peer support, networking and a lot of fun activities for the children. Our daughter Abigail was born with a difference known as symbrachydactyly which means short joined fingers,she has a full thumb and nubbins on her left hand. Prior to going to our first camp the only interaction our family could have with other parents of limb different children was by chatting online through various social media outlets. Abigailsonly interaction was looking at pictures of other kids with limb differences on the internet. We hoped sinceAbigail's birth shewould have the opportunity to meet at least one other child with some type of upper limb difference so she would see that she was not alone.Our first camp was in 2013 and we were a little nervous at first, but we quickly felt like part of a giant family. Our daughter was able to associate with other kids just like her for the first time. Our oldest daughter Kaitlyn was able to see that her little sister was not alone and neither was she as the sibling of a child with a limb difference. Needless to say we were overwhelmed by the amount of activities the kids had and the amount of peer and professional support groups that were available to us.Hand Camp is not just somewhere we go every year, it is more of a yearlyfamily reunion we attend. Camp has changed our lives for the better and opened our eyes to something amazing . Our family has made so many new friends and we have a huge network of parents and children who are so encouraging and supportive.  Hands To Love is such a blessing to our family and countless others.

Every 2 years the CdLS Foundation hosts a national conference in a different part of the country. We had hoped to attend the 2012 conference in Chicago but were unable due to Emery\\'s unstable health at that time. The conference this year (June 26th-29th) will be hosted in Costa Mesa, California. Doctors from around the country who specialize in CdLS come together and attend the conference. The parents get to learn about the latest research and attend workshops. The CdLS children get a one on one consult with the specialists to set up an individualized care plan to bring back home to their doctors to help make sure they get the best care possible. The conference is an amazing opportunity to finally meet other families who go through the same struggles as us, learn from other\\'s experiences, and just be in the company of those who \"just get it\" ; to feel \"normal\" for a couple days. Emery\\'s sister Kyleigh will also be joining and get to see other siblings and how they interact with their special siblings. We are raising money simply because we would hate for Emery to miss out on such an awesome opportunity simply because of the lack of funds. Attending school full time doesn\\'t leave much room to plan out fundraisers, so this is kind of our one shot. The families are responsible for travel expenses, hotel costs, a rental car, food, and registration fees. We qualified for a first time attending scholarship so our registration fee was waived. But travel and hotel fees are not cheap. Anything helps. We are determined to get Emery to California one way or another (: thank you!'),\n",

A \"talker\" (as we are referring to it) helps Jade, who is completely \\ncognitively intact, communicate her thoughts, her wants, her needs, and \\nher feelings in a way that can be understood by those around her. She also has been able to describe what she wants to do, to eat, or where she wants to go.

The ipad will be just for Jade to use to talk. Obviously there are other expenses too such as a protective cover, speaker, carrying case and a few other things (explained below)  that will need to be covered as well to make the device the most accessible and beneficial for Jade.I\\'ve included a detailed explanation as to the items needed to help Jade talk.

He has pledged to match any amount up to $500.  This means we can potentially present him with a $1000 shopping spree at his favorite store!  Here's the kicker... All we need from you is $1.  We just need 500 people to donate $1 each.  This little guy has been through so much and still has a long way to go.

       "  \"On June 27, 2015, our community will gather together to celebrate the joint retirement of Jim and Margie Paynton from the field of music education, where they have amassed a combined 72 years of dedicated ministry to their students.The Payntons have some exciting travel plans in the works for their retirement. Already they have a pilgrimage to the Holy Lands scheduled for the fall of 2015. They also dream of a pipe organ tour of Europe, the warm shores of Tahiti, and much more time onboard the family boat . In light of the Payntons' many accomplishments and years of service, we hope to make as many of these dreams come true as possible.In lieu of a gift, we ask you to consider making a monetary donation to the couple to thank them for their dedication to their students and community. Let's send them into retirement in style! All donations accepted through GoFundMe will be presented as a personal gift to be received at their retirement party. Coming Soon: Check back later for links to make a gift to Kennedy band scholarship fund in honor of Jim or Margie, and to purchase class slideshows, the band retreat video, or organ performance CDs.We hope to see you on Saturday, June 27, 2015 at 1 PM in the Kennedy Catholic High School Cafeteria to celebrate Jim and Margie.About MargieMargie's music education career dates to her entrance to the University of Washington, when she began giving piano lessons to fund her education. She earned double Bachelor degrees in Organ Performance and Music Education in 1976 and 1977. Her professional teaching career started in earnest in 1983 when she joined the staff at Our Lady of Guadalupe in West Seattle, where she developed the music curriculum and began choir and handbell groups. In 1993, Margie moved to the Highline School District where she remains until retirement, teaching at Salmon Creek and McMicken Heights schools initially, and Shorewood Elementary beginning in 1998. At Shorewood, she served on the building design committee and had significant input in the creation of the music space in the new school building. In a parallel career, Margie has served as the church organist, choir director, and subsequently Minister of Music at University Baptist Church since 1976. She became an ordained American Baptist Minister in 2010.About JimAfter the University of Washington's Navy ROTC program discovered his colorblindness, Jim walked across campus and signed up to be a music major. Jim earned his double Bachelor degrees in Clarinet Performance and Music Education in 1976. He actually began his teaching career part time in the fall of 1975 at O'Dea High School, where he was only a few years older than his seniors. At O'Dea, Jim eventually taught a little bit of everything, including English, Religion, World History, Algebra, Health, Glee Club, and Band. In the fall of 1979, Jim joined the teaching staff at Kennedy Catholic High School, focusing exclusively on music and math. His successful orchestra program began in 2007, 32 years into his teaching career. Jim was honored as Music Teacher of the Year in 2008 by the Soundview Music Educators Association. In addition to his 40 year career in Seattle area Catholic Schools, Jim served as Music Director at St. James Cathedral from 1975 to 1980.\"),\n",

We are planning to equip an open space office with the technologies needed to develop The Dream Matcher.

       "  'Dear ones,\\n\\nThis is hard for me to\\ndo.  As I put this together, I find all kinds of emotions arise\\naround asking for support and help instead of offering what I can give to\\nyou. Fear of judgement, fear of pity, fear of rejection, sooo many fears I can\\'t even begin to get to the bottom of them in this moment. What I know is I teach people to walk towards their fears, bring them into the light, throw a party for them, exagerate whatever outcome you are afraid will happen....still to post this, to ask for help in a monetary manner left me immobilized, crying on the floor yesterday, only got written because of the help of my dear friend. It truly shows me just how many blocks I have around receiving financial abundance in my life, and although I celebrate and revel in ALL the beautiful things I cocreate in my existence, I long to let go of whatever stranglehold this holds for me. So thank you for being part of my practice, for witnessing my first step, an invitation to allow another to give \"money\" to me, and my surrender to accept whatever it brings up in me, vowing to find the acceptance and love for those hugely scared parts of me. I have spent my entire life adding value to everyone around me, giving more than I would ever \"take\" I love THAT part of me, why do I shun the receptive allowing another to gift me side? If everyone ONLY gave, who would there be for us to give to? So here it goes.......  As many of you know when I left Utah to follow my path, my\\nfamily disowned me.  Over the years, there has been wonderful healing\\nwith them, but in that time, I realized that I needed to shift my idea of\\nfamily.  My community has become my family of choice and so I\\'m\\nlooking to you in the same way I might go to my family for help and support.\\n\\nOne of the hardest\\nchoices I\\'ve ever made was sending my boys to live with my mom for the next\\nyear. I am extremely grateful for the miracle and circumstances that came\\ntogether for this to happen, and for my Mom showing up to support us in the way\\nthat she can.   Over the past 3 years, despite my best efforts\\nto support myself with my teaching and workshops and Nate\\'s efforts, we simply\\nweren\\'t able to make enough money to pay rent and food.  It\\'s been\\nhand to mouth for a long time.  Yet, the last years have also been\\nthe most joyful in my life. I wouldn\\'t trade a single moment..\\n\\nI\\'m committed in the\\ncoming year to getting myself in a place where my business of teaching,\\nfacilitating and individual sessions can fully support myself and my\\nchildren.  It\\'s moving that way rapidly.  It\\'s tender and\\ndifficult asking for help, yet I know that my journey down this path will be\\ninfinitely easier, more graceful, and more joyful if I don\\'t have to do it all\\nmyself.\\n\\nIn taking my business to\\na more profitable level, I desire to create a stronger infrastructure so that\\npeople can more easily understand where, when and what I\\'m teaching.  I\\nneed to be able to have modern communication so I can work on the road.  And,\\nI want to create a nest egg and savings account, so that at the end of this\\nyear, I have a deposit and first month\\'s rent ready to put down so that my boys\\ncan come back.\\n\\nI have so many people I\\nlove and my hope is that you\\'ll be willing to support me.  If all of\\nmy Facebook friends each contributed $1, I\\'d be financially empowered for all\\nof this.  I\\'m asking people to make whatever contribution feels like\\na \"hell, yes\" in your heart and in your budget.  As you know, I make\\nit a personal practice to dive into whatever scares me the most and right now,\\nasking for help in this way scares me the most.  So I\\'m putting this\\nup now.  I\\'ll likely edit it later as well as adding video and\\nprizes.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown for\\nthe money:\\nPhone\\nCalendar\\nWebsite work\\nMeetup groups\\nLibrary of teachings and\\nwisdoms I have collected these past 7 years\\nMonthly Teleconference\\'s\\nbringing our communities together on the subjects that touch us most\\nHeader\\'s, Fliers,\\ntestimonials to really bring THIS work alive\\nDeposit and first months\\nrent\\n\\nOne of my visions is to\\noffer a big party, the date to be determined, as a thank you to everyone who\\nmakes a contribution, however small.

I have created a new tartan of my own design, based on the Fibonacci sequence, and am raising funds in order to register it with the official registry of tartans.The Fibonacci sequenceOne of the most beautiful series of numbers in all of mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence was described by Leonardo of Pisa , better known as Fibonacci,who wasconsidered \"the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages.\" In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233... or, we can summarize it thus:Fn = F{n-1} + F{n-2}The sequence is closely related to the golden ratio,as the limit of the ratio of consecutive numbers in this sequence, . The golden ratio is found throughout nature, as well as in art and in engineering and science, and is nearly as famous asPi and e. Here\\'s a brief video showing its wonder and beauty.\\n\\nThe TartanLike the Fibonacci sequence, the tartan I have designed is beautiful. It uses yellow, red, dark green, and navy blue to represent the first seven numbers in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. It consists of a1 Yellow thread, then 1 Red thread, then 2 Dark Green threads, then 3 Navy Blue threads, then 5 Red threads, then 8 Dark Green threads, then 13 Navy Blue threads.The DriveI would love to see this tartan officially recognized and brought forth into existence as a magnificient kilt.Registration of a tartan with the Scottish Registrar of Tartans costs 145 GBP (~$220 USD). Once registered, the tartan will be given to the public domain, so that it may be adopted by the clan of math and science enthusiasts, wherever they may be found.Kilts are expensive garments, and a custom tartan is even more expensive. It will cost around 800 GBP (~$1300 USD) to produce the fabric and have a kilt made from it. The kilt will be a traditional 8 yard kilt.Why an 8 yard Great Kilt, and not a less expensive 5 yard kilt? Well, it\\'s actually not any less expensive. For small runs of fabric, a weaver has a minimum order. So to make any of the tartan at all, I\\'ll need to order enough to produce a 8 yard kilt. Besides, it\\'s only fitting that the first garment made from the new tartan be a Great Kilt.The rest of the funds will cover GoFundMe\\'s fees, rewards, and taxes.Rewards!Now that we\\'ve reached100% funding, I have to get to work on the project. T-shirts are being produced, and the tartan registration is being submitted. So I cannot continue to offer these rewards. I\\'ve reached goal anyway -- if you really want to contribute to something, please find another deserving project that needs it. Below are descriptions of the reward levels that were offered when they were available, for reference and posterity:T-shirt After 5 days, the campaign had reached $316 with 10 donations. Beat the average by donating $32 or more to get a lovely Fibonacci Clan tartan t-shirt. Fibonacci FoundersThese special reward levels are now available forthe first person to donate a Fibonacci number to the campaign. The tartan itself symbolizes the first 7 numbers in the sequence. Become the 8th, 9th, 10th, etc. number in the tartan by donating that amount, and your name will be included in the registry submission form as a special thank you! And you\\'ll also get a t-shirt! (Yes, that means there\\'s one t-shirt that will go to the 8th Fibonacci for the bargain price of $21!)Thank you!'),\n",

Thank you for taking the time toread and consider our GoFundMe campaign.For those that don't know, we are Robby and Chieko, a husband-and-wife team who had a dream of owning our own bar. We made our dream a reality when we opened Barringer Bar & Lounge at the beginning of 2014. Things were running smoothly and business was great  even though we were a young bar, we were named one of the hottest bars in Houstonby Zagat, and made Zagat's list of hottest bars in America! but when we were abruptly locked outbythe person/bar we were subleasing from downstairs, we were suddenly bar-less (and have beenfor the past3+ months). Whilewe are currentlydealing with a legal fight,we are looking at the brighter side of things and aremoving forward with our dreams of having our own physical bar again.Which leads us to this happy announcement: we are ecstatic thatwe have signed a lease foranother space in downtown Houston! We are looking forward to designing another Barringer witha similarlook and feel as the original: we will pay homage to the deep history of downtown Houston with the exposed brick, antique furniture, and historical archives that we shared with our410 location.Luckily, we are only a few blocks away fromour original location, and the space was previously a bar as well, so the turn-around time should be relatively quick. We arehoping the move will be bigger and better for our business and for our amazing and loyal clientswhohave been patiently waiting with us. The first Barringer was a collaboration of our entire life savings, friends helping, calling in favors, and good old-fashioned elbow grease. This time around, we are fortunate enough to have the same help... minus the savings. The unfortunate truth is that we put all of our personal funds into making our first dream a reality, and now with our legal fight and the work we put into the old location, we are having a hard time doing this alone. Please help us with getting the new bar off the ground!\\nAny amount will do! We know that the goal is high; however, every dollar will go towards materials, equipment, andoverhead to get the doors open.Thank you again and we look forward to serving you soon!-Chieko & Robby(Us looking a wee bit tired after the Barringer grand opening but totally worth it!)\"),\n",

       "  \"From Food Truck to Brick + Mortar: Part 1Love, Chimichurri, + The Blue Ridge MountainsAfter moving from Miami, Florida to Asheville, North Carolina almost four years ago with our then infant daughter, we (Nestor + Ashley Teran) became inspired by the many young business owners in town who decided to try to make a living from pursuing their passions. We knew that we could take our talents and turn them into a career! With Ashleys love of design and Nestors amazing abilities in the kitchen, we had a recipe for success. We decided to put our entire life savings (Ashley's inheritance) into the creation of Smash Events, Inc., an event planning, and catering company with a food truck serving both locally in Asheville and at private catered events.Business really took off. In our first season, we did several festivals and one wedding with Smash Box Mobile Kitchen. People began to see the love we put into everything we do. They also appreciated the fact that Nestor is bringing an entirely different type of Latin American cuisine to this part of the country. Through our food, folks are learning that Latin American cuisine has many different flavors! Now, in our third season, we have over 15 weddings, several large multi-day festivals, and lots of regular food truck gigs on the books for 2015 alone. In addition to foodtrucking and catering, in our second year of business we expanded to include complete floral and event design too!Winter is Coming.As a food truck, we can only operate so many hours and days per week. Although we have worked so hard to build a brand and a decent fan-base in Asheville, we are not able to reach as many people as we'd like. Our catering business is also expanding at an exponential rate, and we simply cannot continue to grow using our little 12' truck as our sole kitchen. We need a homebase for our floral and design side as well. Smash Events needs a home.As we put our entire life savings into the creation of our food truck, we simply have nowhere else to turn than to our loving fans, family, and other investors to help us continue making this dream a reality. We will be personally investing in our transition into a permanent space, but we can't do it alone!A Two-Part CampaignOur campaign will be broken up into two parts. Part 1will help us get into a space, once we find something that suits our needs. Part 2 will help us cover permitting fees, cosmetic improvements, a new sign, and any additional equipment we may need before our big grand opening.We plan to keep Smash Box Mobile Kitchen, to be used for catering and larger festivals. Our clients love the fact that we cook onsite at their events, and catering is something we have very much grown to love! Having a brick and mortar will allow us to share everything we have to offer with a much larger audience.We want to be able to expand our menu to include many of the Latin favorites that we grew up eating in Miami, including many Nicaraguan dishes we cannot create on the truck. We'd like to add some of Ashley's Italian family dishes to the menu as well. We'd love to expand our work with Asheville City Preschools because being able to create a sense of wonder for kids is EVERYTHING. We envision a coffee counter, with native Ashevillians enjoying small-talk over a colada. We want to provide that kid-friendly, beer-serving, dog-lovin' atmosphere that is so integral to the Asheville we fell in love with four years ago. We want live music, brunch on the weekends, the whole nine.Thank you so much for considering contributing to our campaign.\"),\n",

I have gone from being a family and community herbalist, to farmers markets, to getting my goods into natural health food stores, and holistic practitioners offices, and now into my own new facility to work out of. It's such an amazing honor, and sometimes I can hardly believe it's really happening! Some of you are probably wondering what I'm planning to do out of this new space. The space is going to be called Mountain Mel's Green Canyon Apothecary, in Welches, Oregon. Green Canyon is named after one of the most beautiful places on the planet just a few miles down the road. We will be using the space to continue to produce & grow Mountain Mels online and wholesale business. We will also be opening up a retail space, The Green Canyon Apothecary, to the people of the Mount Hood community, and the millions of travelers that visit this area.Green Canyon Apothecary will be a vibrant, friendly, fresh, clean, and open space. We will be a well stocked apothecary with bulk herbs & oils, herbal products, high quality supplements, and other natural health care supplies. We will be serving teas and smoothies out of the space that will be made from organic & locally grown produce. If you live up here, or travel here often, you know that quick, convenient, nourishing, and healthy food on the go is very hard to come by! We will also be offering classes on herbal medicine and natural living skills. We will essentially be a hub of natural health and well being for the Mount Hood community! A much needed space for us all!Mountain Mels Essential Goods has come a long way, and weve got quite a bit more to go. Heres a sneak peek at the work weve done so far.This is what you see when you enter the space from the outside area. Keep in mind, it's not well stocked yet. ;)This is looking at the front door from our kiddie play corner. Yes, this is a VERY kid friendly establishment! Come in and let your child get lost in our adorable wooden kitchen while you shop & sip herbal tea! We'll even offer herb classes specific for your little ones. :)This is the warehouse space where we store our bulk herbs & finished products. It's also going to be our shipping and receiving room.This is what our awesome crew will get to look at from behind the counter, as they smile and serve you your teas and smoothies! Not too shabby of a space to work! It will look much better with the paper off of the windows. ;) And here it is! Our beautiful shiny new commercial kitchen where all of this incredible herbal goodness will be produced out of! Hip Hip Hooray! Let me tell you, it feels absolutely amazing to make herbal medicine in this space!Ok ok, enough with the pretty pictures, & back to the money and why I'm now asking for your help. You see, all of this has cost an awful lot of money! From the rent, construction, paint, furnishings, electricity, equipment, inventory, insurance, advertising, employees, cups, trash bags, jars, and so much more. The list is long, and so is the bill! I don't want to daunt you with too much, because it's really not that much fun to think about. ;) This whole time, all of this money has come from the pocket of my family, putting all of the business money earned back into the business, and a few very close friends who also believe in my dream. I know there's a lot of you out there who love seeing all of this happening, who love watching the growth, and who truly believe in what I'm doing, and are incredibly excited for what I'm trying to bring to this community. Well, I'm now asking for your help! How will this money be used? These funds will allow me to get more inventory for the space, so that we can have more to offer you when you come in. I will be able to buy a new Vitamix and several pitchers to ensure those with allergies & food sensitivities will not be contaminated. I will be able to increase my inventory of Mountain Mel's products, packaging, & labels for the coming season. I will be able to fix the commercial dishwasher, so that I can have sanitary dishes quickly. I will be able to purchase the locally crafted display boxes I need. It will allow me to get more relationships started with local farmers. It will help me to provide new jobs to people! It will help me to get through these first few months of opening a new space, and acquiring a lot of new overhead Really, the money will do so much in allowing me to bring a hub of health and wellbeing to the Mount Hood community & beyond!!The sooner I am able to raise these funds, the sooner I am able to open the doors to Mountain Mel's Green Canyon Apothecary. Many of you have asked when I'm opening and expressed a great amount of excitement. Please, help me open sooner!Every little bit helps! $5, $20, $50, $100 whatever you feel you can spare to help me out! So maybe you're incredibly broke too? Trust me I get it! You could help me a lot by sharing this message with your friends, email it, post it on Facebook, send it to someone you think might be interested in helping this dream truly come alive. I will be FOREVER GRATEFUL!!!So yes, I did it. I broke through a fear of mine and what is a great challenge to me.

Our goal is to create a place where those who enjoy tabletop strategy games and board games can come and play in a fun and friendly environment with open gaming. We plan to carry a wider selection of miniatures/models, games and painting supplies than is currently available in the area, as well as offer in-house painting services and painting lessons for those who are interested. We have a location chosen for the store in the shopping center at the corner of Harlem and Alpine, part of the funds we'll need to get it up and running and several offers of help for remodeling and getting the space ready. We just need to raise the rest of the money we need to get the idea off the ground. Andrew was the store manager of the local Games Workshop store for close to two years and both of us have prior, long term management and supervisory experience with Circuit City in various roles. We worked together for nearly 10 years and work well as a team. For those who are interested in the painting/etching certficate reward levels, photos of Jenn's painted miniatures and etched model horses can be seen in the photo albums on her studio page at  https://www.facebook.com/ShadowfaxStudio and there are more miniature pictures on the Black Dog store page at  https://www.facebook.com/blackdoghobbyandgame?fref=ts. All models to be painted/etched are to be supplied by the donor that the work is being done for. Model horses that are to be painted should be prepped first if possible. Crocheted items will be started as donations are received so we can hopefully avoid having too much of a backlog at any point in time and painted/etched items will be started in the order they are received.

My grandfather went in for open heart surgery & when they opened him up they realized it was too complicated and he'd have to be transported to United Hospital for the procedure. While waiting for him to come out of surgery at United I had lunch in the cafeteria, where I met Adam. It was love at first site! I knew right then, he was the one I wanted to spend my life with. About 3 years in we decided to start a family but couldn't get pregnant. And we just kept telling ourselves to be patient. We waited. And waited. But no luck. So we went to the Dr. Adam had a low count and his semen were clumped together at the tails!  All of his swimmers were going in different directions, but not really moving because they were stuck together. At that point, we decided to try insemination. We went through 4 rounds before our Dr suggested IVF. We weren't ready for that so we asked for other options. We were sent to a urologist who told us Adam had a veicole vein that needed to be repaired in his scrotum. They said that may be the cause of the clumping. Adam was not excited to have this surgery, but he wanted a baby of his own & went through with the procedure. It was a success! His count skyrocketed & had many less clumps! The Dr said give it a year to heal. We waited again. Still nothing. We decided to go ahead with IVF . This  was truly the hardest thing we have ever been through. The emotions were endless. I cried uncontrollably through the whole process, man the hormones they give you! This also didn't work and we spent so much money! That was a tough pill to swollow. We decided to give up trying for a while. I just wasn't ready to try again.Fast forward 2 years. We decided to think about coming up with the money to try IVF again.

       "  'Hi friends! Thanks for visiting our GoFundMe page. We are raising money to bring Baby Feuille home and hope that you will join our story by contributing financially to our adoption! A little bit about us: We have been married for six years and have been trying to get pregnant for just about three years, but have some complications that make it very hard for that to happen. Since we have always wanted to adopt, we have decided to move forward in faith, trusting that God is going to provide for our every need. Adoption is not easy, emotionally or financially. It is a very real choice to love and sacrifice, but ultimately we choose adoption because we believe that God has something beautiful in it.While we will be contributing significantly to our own adoption, we humbly ask that you would consider partnering with us financially so that we can bring our baby home.  The agency cost is $35,000. All money contributed to our adoption will be going directly from us to the agency.We are adopting domestically from an agency in Houston, Adoption Information and Counseling Services . We have completed all our paperwork and are just waiting on that phone call that to tell us we have been matched! Funds are due at that time, and since there is no way of knowing when that may be, we are moving forward in the fundraising process so we can have all our finances in order as soon as possible.Thank you in advance for your prayers, love, support and all around good vibes. We hope you will become a partner in this beautiful story God is writing for us!'),\n",

       "  \"Boy meets Girl, they become friends, they fall in love, they get married...the rest is history. Usually their family starts to grow is the next step....usually is the key word here. It wasn't an usually for us, as we have been trying for several years to have a child and with no success we still remain a small family of two even though we'd love to be more than two.We've tried a lot of different treatments under the sun to help us overcome infertility and to expand our family. Sadly, our family wasn't/isn't expanding so easily. We have spent the last 3  years trying to conceive and the last 2  years of that with the help of doctors doing treatments and searching for a reason for our difficult struggle. It is/was very expensive spending these 2  years (almost 3) at doctor appointments that are not covered by insurance; and each step seems to end in the heartbreak of not achieving success. We have tried several different treatments:natural herbal vitamins (fertility blend, etc),clomid, IUI (10 failed ones -- some with clomid, some with injectables, some with letrozole),  acupuncture ...we also tried old wives tales. If you suggested it, we already tried it and yes we relaxed through it all (took vacations, planned other things to keep our minds off of it and any other unsolicited advice that was gave as a trick to get pregnant) and still no success. Our doctors next suggestion for us would be IVF as nothing else we have tried has gone through and it all has ended in the results of us not being pregnant. We want and continue to fight for our dream, which is to be parents. So with that being said, here we are stepping out on faith and prayer and moving forward with IVF. It is expensive (around the price of $18,000.00) and invasive, plus it can be quite scary as it doesn't always work (50% chance of working with our age). Nonetheless we are still stepping out on faith; as we no longer want to hold off on taking that next step for the fear of what if this fails like everything else. We realized that we would regret not trying and we would regret never knowing if it will succeed more than if we never tried at all. Time isnt on our side, the longer we wait the less chance of success we have, so we would like to be able to raise at least $5,000.00 to pay for some of the cost for the IVF. Even though our dream of being parents and having a child isnt coming the way most people were/are able to conceive children. We can still have it become a possible dream and a reality with the help of doctors and an IVF. We would really like a chance like others have; who havent dealt with infertility, to become parents to a child that shares our genetics. This is our main reason for pursuing IVF versus other family building options at this time and we hope to have your support.So here we are at this step in our road that we never thought we have to take. We are not asking to raise money for the whole treatment, but just for a small part of the procedure. We are hoping to raise the goal of $5,000.00 by August 27th, 2015, which is the next doctor appointment we have regarding treatment and cost, an appointment that is exactly two weeks after our 4 year wedding anniversary. Please if you are able to donate we appreciate it. Any amount would help...even if you donate $2 dollars, $5, $10, $50...etc.  We thank you in advance for helping us to keep fighting for our dream to become parents. It means a lot to us and we hope it is in your heart to help us achieve this dream even if it is with a small donation. Also if you rather donate another way, don't hesitate to email us. Peace, Love and Blessings, from our family to you.\"),\n",

       "  'Dear family and friends:Infertility is not something we ever thought we would be facing. Asking for your help is not easy for us, and posting this leaves me feeling incredibly vulnerable and exposed. We have been trying to start our family for over a year now. This week we got devastating news that I am in ovarian failure. This news shocked us to our core and left me feeling like I was suffocating. We were absolutely crushed. Something that is so simple for so many will not only be very expensive, but also has a very small time limit of possibility. I\\'ve wanted children for as long as I can remember. It wasn\\'t far into our relationship that Brad and I talked about our love for the kids in our life and how we couldn\\'t wait until we could start our family. Last November we began the journey of trying to start our family. Something we thought would happen quickly and easily, didn\\'t. We waited 10 months, every single month ending in heartbreak and disappointment. We began fertility testing with a Reproductive Endocrinologist (\"RE\") in September. After finishing the majority of expensive testing and only finding a small issue on Brad\\'s side (low morphology) we were told we were great candidates for a medicated/IUI cycle (intrauterine insemination). I picked up the medication and we were ready to start this cycle on 11/12/14. We were hopeful and excited that we would finally be starting our family. That morning I had to go in for bloodwork to check 3 hormone levels before we started the IUI process (this was cycle day specific blood work). That afternoon I got the results that my FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) was 22.5. Anything over 10 is considered high. The doctor cancelled our IUI cycle and had me begin a Clomid Challenge Test. From cycle days 5-9 I took 100mg of clomiphene citrate each day. On the 10th day (11/19) I went in for a repeat FSH blood test. Late that morning I got the call that crushed our world. My level had raised to over 37 which meant I had not responded to the medication. The next morning we went in for an appointment to meet with our RE. He went over the results and also did an ultrasound to see how my body reacted to the medication. I had 1 egg on each side, measuring 1mm in size. This was a very poor response. Our RE believes I am in ovarian failure. I have a 2% chance of getting pregnant and only a couple of months to try. My hormone levels will continue to get worse. Asking for help is not something Brad or I am any good at doing. We never thought we would be in the position that we are in. Not only do we have to spend an incredible amount to try to have our baby, but we only have a couple of months to try. If we had been told IVF would be our only hope, but that we had more than enough time, we would never ask anyone for help. Unfortunately, we don\\'t have the luxury of time to save money and finance this in a good way for ourselves. We had saved some money to use as a downpayment on land we were hoping to purchase (to someday build our dream home on), but now we will be using that money towards IVF. Because of our chances and time limit, we are probably going to be using the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine. This clinic has incredible statistics (which is why it is so expensive). Their statistics with patients in my situation are good. Brad and I are not willing to give up on the chance to have OUR baby yet. We will have 1 chance to have our baby and try IVF, so we are going to give it all we can. My brother and his family live near Denver so we will have a place to stay for free, and can also get cheap flights on Frontier Airlines. We don\\'t expect to get our IVF journey covered completely, heck, we don\\'t even expect much as far as donations go.....but we had to put this out there and try. We are sorry for even having to ask, but we truly need your help. Brad and I are meant to be parents. While this is not the way we thought we would be starting our family, we are hopeful to start this journey and bring home our baby. We could use all of your thoughts and prayers as we embark on this scary journey. With love, Amy and Brad'),\n",

Oh how only if that could always be true without any problems.Did you know that one out of six couples face infertility? We are that one out of six. This trial has been emotional and certainly a growing experience as weve had to lean on the Lord in ways like never before.We\\'ve decided to break our silence and share our story. After three years of trying and three failed IUIs, its being recommended we advance to In vitro fertilization (IVF). Weve prayed about whether this is the right course of action for us and have felt affirmed that this is the next step in our journey.Its an expensive venture and the final hurdle in moving forward is the financial barrier. Unfortunately, Indiana isn\\'t one of the fifteen states that provides insurance coverage to couples pursuing fertility treatment. The expense of IVF is $15,000. Asking for support for something so personal is very humbling. We dont want anyone to feel pressured or obligated. However, if you do have a desire to contribute, we have committed to run the Monumental Half-Marathon on Saturday, November 7, 2015 and would love for you to consider making a gift of $52. That is $2 per mile for each of the 13.1 that well both run. If financially youre unable or dont feel called or inclined to, we absolutely understand but we still covet your prayers.IVF is not a guarantee but we want to give ourselves the best chance possible and that means reducing stress. So we dont feel any extra pressure, we arent going to share the exact date of our procedure. We can say we hope it will be sometime in the first three months of next year. If the first attempt is unsuccessful well optimistically have another opportunity to try again at a much reduced price tag. To learn more about IVF, visit  http://www.resolve.org/family-building-options/ivf-art/in-vitro-fertilization-understanding-the-process.html. Were certainly praying well have success on our very first try. If by chance, we raise over our goal and our first attempt is unsuccessful well use the additional monies towards our second round of IVF. If it is successful, wed like to use the monies to start a donor advised fund to help other couples facing the same trial.For those that contribute over $50, youll receive an Operation Baby Beckwith dog tag necklace that will be engraved with Matthew 19:26, With God all things are possible.\"'),\n",

       "  \"If you are a parent or grandparent, you know that children are the light of the universe. I find myself in tragic circumstances and need your support. My name is Jeff Coutts and I need your help to adopt my grandsons- Jaxon and Izzy.On Thursday, February 26th, 2015, I learned that my beloved daughter Stephanie was a missing person. On Sunday, March 1st, I was informed by the Coroner's Office in Clark County , Nevada that Stephanie was dead. She was twenty-nine years old.I immediately went to Las Vegas to attend to the heartbreaking details. I then went to California where my grandsons Jaxon (aged 9) and Izrahel (nicknamed Izzy, aged 7) were staying with Izzy's paternal grandmother. It was up to me to tell my young grandsons of their mother's passing after which I intended to bring the boys back to Denver , Colorado , the home they'd known for nearly all of their lives.Stephanie - a single mother - and her sons had lived with me since Izzy was an infant. I knew firsthand how difficult it was to be a single parent as I myself had been a single father, raising Stephanie and her older brother on my own for twelve years, thus I did all I possibly could to offer a loving, stable home to the boys, a devoted grandfather doing the fathering. In addition to all the everyday parenting chores, I infused my grandsons' lives with my own passions: a love of music, cooking and the great outdoors. Our trio was happiest hiking and biking in Colorado .My daughter and my grandsons were my life and I, theirs. Having lost my own father at a young age, I was determined to model love, affection, healthy living and communal citizenship, the latter of which I learned and lived while serving on submarines in the United States Navy.Last July, seeking new adventures, and wanting to live near the ocean, Stephanie and her sons moved to California ; Stephanie had planned on temporarily living with Izzy's paternal grandmother until she could get on her feet and find an apartment of their own. I was heartbroken to see them leave Colorado , but proud of Stephanie's self-confidence and her assertion for independence.Now, in the midst of my own agonizing grief, I need to be stronger than ever before for my grandsons. I'm currently in California , in a custody battle with Izzy's paternal grandmother, a women who sent the boys to school - without any counseling nor support - the very day after they learned that their mother was dead. I have only been able to see the boys for short amounts of time, on supervised visits, while they are grieving. Clearly, this situation is not in their best interests.Though there has never been much influence nor interaction from either of the boys' fathers, nor is there any guarantee that the boys will be able to stay together if Izzy's paternal grandmother keeps them, she is fighting for custody of both boys, the motive of which appears to be the monetary gain as she had told Stephanie  that she needed to move out , effectively evicting her and the boys from the home.\\nI have text strings from Stephanie to her network of friends in California desperately seeking a new place to live and now that Stephanie is gone the paternal grandmother of Isrehal is fighting me for custody of both boys?. Why?It's difficult to ask for help, but I urgently need it. I have to pay for all the legal fees associated with an emergency hearing and custody proceedings as well as living expenses in California until I can leave with the boys. Moreover, instead of readying for my retirement, I will be raising my grandsons. The expenses ahead are daunting; the immediate concern is getting Jaxon and Izzy the counseling they need to deal with their staggering loss.I know what is best for my grandsons. I know the life that Stephanie would have wanted for them. \\nThese boys need to stay together as they only have each other, my son, Jake, their uncle and me left of their Mother, Stephanie.\\nJaxon and Izzy need to be in a nurturing, supportive and healthy environment with a loving caretaker that can help them heal and grow. Please help me provide that for these precious boys.Thank you all for your support and well wishes.Up until the last 7 months, I was a caretaker of Jaxon and Izzy. From bathing and feeding the boys (we love to cook together), to putting them to bed or getting them ready for school-this was my everyday life.As you can see from my Facebook page, I am and have been in their young lives since almost the beginning  and am continuing this to raise these boys TOGTHER and in an environment where they will heal and grow into the men they are meant to be.Your assistance will be greatly appreciated more than you can know.So if this story speaks to you, please send your love and support.My email is jcoutts59@gmail.com if you want to share in the Life to come.\"),\n",

For those of you that know Amanda, you're aware of her fun spirit, hilarious laugh, dedication to nursing, and incredible love for Christ. Not to mention, she's head over heels for her husband Spencer- who is ironically the male version of her. Amanda has been of my best friends since elementary school, and I can remember her saying that she has always wanted a large family someday. I don't know if Spencer necessarily wants quite as many children as Amanda does, but I know that he would give her the moon if he could. When Spencer was 19, he became very ill and was diagnosed with leukemia. After 2 years of treatment, Spencer was told that the cancer was gone. He has been cancer free for about 8 years now. (YAY) And while that is terrific news, he has been robbed of the chance to now have children naturally with his wife. Knowing that this could happen, Spencer was allowed to save some of his sperm prior to chemo. Amanda and Spencer are currently looking into invetro fertilization and they been told that they have exactly 2 tries to make a baby. While they have not received an exact quote on the price of this procedure yet, it has been estimated to be about $20,000.Additionally, whether or not it is in God's plan for them to bear children of their own, they have already filed an application for adoption with an agency in Indianapolis. Adopting a child has been part of Amanda and Spencer's plan since the beginning of their marriage and they have agreed to adopt regardless of their own childbearing capabilities. The agency they are going through has quoted them a price of $25,700 to adopt a child in the United States.As their friend, and with their consent, I would like to personally invite anyone to donate to this cause. For those of you that know Amanda and Spencer, you know that they are truly an amazing couple and they deserve the chance to expand their family. They just need a little help from their friends! While donations are helpful, I ask that you please add Spencer and Amanda to your prayer list as we know that God will ultimately direct their path. Thank you!!For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11\"),\n",

       "  \"Dear Friends and Family,Thank you for taking the time to consider supporting us financially as we are on this journey of adoption.In the fall of 2014, in the midst of trying to begin a family of our own, we were faced with the harsh reality of infertility. Even though it was a difficult truth to realize, we felt an overwhelming sense of peace from God. You see, both of us had considered the possibility of adoption before we decided to build our own family. Both of us had sensed a calling from God to open our hearts and home to a child who would otherwise not have a family to call their own. Neither of us realized that this calling could have been placed on our hearts for this very specific time in our lives when we would find out that this was the way that God had intended for us to build our family from the start!We recently relocated to Middleburg, FL to follow God's leading in our lives to become pastors. Once we settledinto our responsibilities and community, we began seeking out an adoption agency that aligned with our beliefs and offered support for both adoptive parents and birth parents. With some research and recommendations from dear friends of ours who have gone through the adoption journey themselves, we settled on Bethany Christian Services of Winter Park, Fl. Bethany is the largest Christian adoption agency in the United States and requires every adoption applicant to be a participating member of a church body. Applicants are also required to provide a testimony of their faith, along with references from their pastor and other church members. On August 1, 2015, we attended an informational meeting that secured our decision to work with this agency.A couple of days later we submitted our formal application and were approved for adoption! Now we are faced with the hefty load of paperwork, doctor's appointments, background tests and reference checks required to continue screening us for adoption. This is all something that we can handle with no problem-Sheena is extremely organized and efficient!However, the financial portion that we must also square away is another story. When we decided to adopt, we were aware of the financial implications, but are now starting to realize the reality of what can quickly become a stressful, and discouraging burden on what should be a hopeful, joyful experience. But after talking with some friends and family who have shared an interest to be supportive to us in any way possible-even financially, we were encouraged to create this fundraising profile.Our obvious goal is to raise a portion of the $25,000 fee that is before us as we seek to adopt our very first child.We are able to apply for adoption grants, butthere is still a good amount that we are required to personally up front. Already we have received a few donations from friends who have felt God calling them to support us in this way-and we are so grateful! Through this fundraising profile, we want to enlarge that territory and allow others who may feel the same call to give from their hearts.Know that we in no way, shape or form, want to pressure our friends and family to give what they do not have. We are blessed beyond measure knowing that you are already supporting us through prayers and encouragement! So we want to ask that you continue to support us in that way, and if you feel led, to consider supporting us financially as well.In order to keep you all abreast of our journey, we have created a blog so that you can follow us throughout the entire process. We want you all to feel a part of this exciting period in our lives as our dearest friends and family. Our Adoption Journey We love you and thank you in advance for all of your support and love.Blesssings!Jeff and Sheena\"),\n",

Medically speaking, the chances of us having our own biological children are basically zero. But, that's OK. God has been preparing our hearts for this a long time. For the first few years of marriage, our options were quite limited in the adoption world-- most agencies require that you be at least 25 years of age and we didn't make the cut for a bit. When we reached the magic age of 25, we began looking into routes of adoption again. We looked into a private agency--went to a few meetings, but decided it wasn't for us at the time. We then went to Clayton County DFCS and began the foster to adopt process. This led us to a state subsidized agency. We were with this program for the last year and a half. In March of this year, before we had a complete home study, we found out that the agency had lost its contract with the state of Georgia and so we would be forced to look elsewhere. Months before those doors closed, we had gotten onto a waiting list at a private adoption agency here in Georgia. After finding out that our agency was closing, we knew we had made the right decision. August has come and gone and we are officially in the adoption processatCovenant Care in Macon, GA. When all is said and done, our adoption costs will be around 19-20k. While this is no small amount, we are confident that it is attainable. We have been busy saving and have already been blessed by many donations. We are thankful to have incredible family and friends beside us along the way.Please be in prayer for us as we continue in this adoptive journey-- it's an emotional roller coaster, but one we are glad to be on!Love,Chris & Dori\"),\n",

It gives students with disabilities the opportunity to participate in the same experiences as their same age peers. Although Mason Life is very beneficial, it is also very expensive.

Soon after, the universe began to set things in motion for me to be able to go. I was invited to attend a FREE Seminar on African History & Civilization. During this seminar it was announced that the people that held the seminar also hosted an annual \"FREE\" trip to Egypt. Well boom! There was my opportunity right there. I attended the orientation and found out more about the program. It is ran by an organization out of Glenside PA called African Genesis.They offer a \"FREE\" trip to Africa by providing opportunities for you to raise your own money to go. However, they have put an entire program together where as I will be volunteering as a Group Leader to help chaperon around 100 children that will also be going to Egypt. Here is the kicker. The program is not only for going to Africa. It is entire learning experience that both the adults & the children must attend. Not only that, both the adults and the children will be required to do history assignments. I will be Learning along with the children and helping them learn at the same time. The entire program is over a two year period and includes going to other African historical trips such as the Underground Railroad Tour, The Slave Route Tour, and the Black Baltimore Tour. Here is what I\\'m required to do as a Group Leader;  \"Group leaders are involved in all aspects of the 27-month program and the trip to Africa. It is the responsibility of the group leaders to regularly communicate with the participating students assigned to them, to answer any questions the students may have about the program and the information being disseminated. They also monitor the students to ensure that they receive all information, attend the bi-monthly classes and complete the monthly book reports and assignments. Group leaders also closely supervise the students on the cultural trips and the sojourn to Africa and must identify any health, educational or emotional special needs of the student. Group leaders are required to participate in leadership training which includes workshops in personal development, critical thinking, cultural awareness, diversity, stress management, team building and communication skills.\"They allow us to pay in increments and the 1st $700 is due by June. So here is what I am asking. I am asking for as many people as possible to support me going to Africa as a Group Leader. If you follow my FB page you know that I am heavily involved in studying our ancient herstory from a metaphysical eye. Imagine if I am actually on the land.... and in touch with the energy of the ancestors. I am positive I will bring back not only knowledge to put on social media but knowledge that I will be putting in a book because that is my ultimate goal. So I am asking for Donations and/or to purchase books of tickets for $12. Here is how the tickets work. There is 3 cash prizes for $1000, $500, & $250. The drawing of the winning ticket is on June 13, 2015 @ 1pm. If you are out of state I will give you your ticket numbers instead of the actual booklet because they will need it in order to verify the winner. I will record the announcement of the numbers. If you are out of state and your number is called you will have to sign a document with African Genesis & then they will send you a check in the mail. If you dont want to buy tickets then you can donate. My birthday is soon, perhaps make it a gift:-). I will also be selling skating tickets as part of the fundraiser amongst other things. Please support one of your favorite people \\n\\nand help me get to the Mother Land so that I can come back and share my experiences with you.'),\n",

Her mother and grandmother, my sister, passed away within months of each other when she was a senior in high school. She has always had aspirations of becoming a dentist. She was able to go to Howard University and earn her BS in health science. She was invited to MeHarry Medical School to attend their masters program which was required for entry into Dental School.She is now in dental school.While there she lost her uncle, dad and grandmother within months of each other. Quite frankly I don't know how she has continued to function. Well she is, and is doing quite well in school.She is unable to work due to her course load and is currently living off of student loans. She was in a car accident and her car was totaled. She was not hurt. Her insuranceproceeds are going to help pay off her car with a small balance left. Needless to say she cannot afford another car. Living in Nashville and having to stay at school for all hours of the night, a vehicle is required. She needs good reliable transportation so that she will also be able to drive back home during breaks as flying is too expensive for her budget. Thus I am setting up this gofundme request as a last resort. If ever there was someone to help, she is the person. She is a product of Achieveable Dream Academy and exemplifies that program. Any amount would be helpful. If I could buy her a car I would, but circumstances prevent me from doing so. I amsure Kamilah would rather I not do this as she is a very proud young lady. Likewise I am a very proud person but sometimes you have to set pride aside!Any funds remaining after a vehicle is purchased will be used to help with living expenses while she is in school!Thank you for your support,Chris\"),\n",

Thousands of people my age are thrown head first into a mind-boggling world of heavy financial responsibility when they graduate high school and pursue a secondary education. Having graduated from Chicago's top private high school, I was convinced that my academic achievements would secure my place in a college that would allow me to learn relatively debt-free. As fate would have it, though, I arrived at Whittier College last fall with a staggering bill of around $24,000 in tuition and fees. An obviously insurmountable figure for any one person, I begged and pleaded with the financial aid and business offices to award me more money. Eventually, my bill was reduced to $4600, which, while much more manageable, is still beyond my family and I's ability to earn before the Spring term is set to start on February 2nd. If you have the means to donate to my tuition fund, whether it be a dollar or a few, any amount will ease the burden placed on my family and I.

I have been a Culbreth mom for 6 years. When I learned how little our teachers earn compared to those in other states, I decided to start this campaign to give them an added bonus during the holidays and before the end of the year. Every year, as those envelopes get bigger, we have seen teachers cry with gratitude because they can make a much needed home repair, take a loved one out for a celebration, buy their child a bike or pay off a medical bill. As this campaign becomes a tradition, it has contributed to a school community where the teachers genuinely feel valued.The campaign is in my name because if we gave the money to the school or the PTSA, we could not give it directly to the teachers. Once the campaign closes, I will withdraw the funds in my name. Wendy Alfieri and I (and whoever else wants to pitch in!) will divide all the donated money into envelopes, one for each Culbreth employee. Then we insert a note that quotes from donor comments and gives the campaign link so our teachers and staff can read everything we wrote to them. On the \"red carpet\" day during the last week of school, we meet the teachers as they walk in for the day and distribute every dollar we raised directly to our Culbreth Teachers and staff. All the decorations, paper for notices, printing, envelopes etc . . are purchased by Culbreth parents, and do not come from the funds. If you are interested in joining me and other parents as we stuff the envelopes, please let me know. After that happens, our wonderful Police Officer Stan Newsome keeps the envelopes in his safe until distribution day! Everyone who donates will get an email announcing the red carpet morning.

To do this, he put a lot of time and money into turning hisclassroom into this:[Above: A full historical mural adorns the classroom wall.][Above: A view from the classroomdoorway toward \"The Pulpit of Knowledge\".][Above: A view from the front of the room out toward the students\\' desks... andlife-size Warrior statue, functioning guillotine, and Egyptian pharaoh\\'s chair!][Above: A \"Hartnell-Original\" lecture as it appears on the H-MAX, a 15\\' x 15\\' theater-esque screen.][Above: What do you get when you combine ESPN\\'s Sports Center with the American Revolution?Playing various Founding Fathers (and Chris Berman), Benanchors a memorable trip through the Revolution!][Above: If it\\'s your birthday, be ready to see everything that happened on your \"special day\" during Ben\\'s\"This Day in History\"... and receive the prized \"Birthday Pencil\"![Above: Outside Room #135, you can find a visual history of the American Flag with 17 authentic reproductions running the length of the hallway!]----------It took years, but Benwas finally able to createa visually pleasing space, fromthe giant pulpit from where hedelivers hismovie theater-sized sermons/lectures to the gorgeous mural on the classroom wall. To add to the experience, hepurchased historically accurate uniforms to bring hislectures and reenactments to life. For example:[Above: Dressed in Antebellum attire, Benspoke at the City of Westerville\\'s Sesquicentennial Celebration.][Above: A Spartan Hoplite soldier.][Above: Roman General. This is one of Ben\\'s favorite and is an on-set replica of the one worn by Russell Crowe in the movie \"Gladiator\".][Above: Ben\\'s9/11 Heroes tribute - and a VERY powerful 9/11 presentation every year.][Above: Medieval Knights Templar... all 75 lbs of it!][Above: The feared \"Redbeard\" of the 18th Century!]----------Benuses theseuniformsto createauthenticand hands-on educational experiences for hisstudents, including his\"Tar and Feather Day\" (where his classesuse syrup and feathers to protest taxes), his\"Civil War Battle Reenactment\" (where his studentsuse over 3,000 water balloons, cannons,horses,and Civil War reenactors to simulate a battle), and his\"Presidential Fight Club\" (where 32 of our nation\\'s Commander-in-Chiefs go toe-to-toe to answer\"Who\\'s #1?\" and take home an actual boxing trophy!).[Above: \"Tar & Feather Day\"][Above:Union soldiersabsorb a\"direct hit\".][Above: Reenactors provide a real sense of panic and chaos for my battle simulation.][Above: The Confederates hold the line during a volley of balloons from the Union soldiers.][Above: The \"Presidential Fight Club\"... the best way to get students excited about American Presidents. Plus, the winners take home a trophy!]----------As Bengets ready to begin his15th year teaching in the fall, he would like to replace classroom equipment that has begun to break down due to wear and tear, as well as purchase new uniforms and accessories that, too, have grown old over time. For instance  when hewears in the 75lbs of chainmail, hebrings in a spare set for the students to try on. The same goes for other uniforms that heprovide students so they get to feel and see history. Hefrequentlyloans hisprops and uniforms to fellow teachers for use in their own classrooms. This has expedited the uniforms\\' deterioration.In 2012, Benturned 35 and promptly announced hiscandidacy for U.S. President. Benused hisactual campaign as a way to teach hisstudents about the issues by having them discuss and debate what hisvarying platforms should be. To carry out thiscampaign, his studentsmade shirts, yard signs, and websites. And while hedidnt win (bummer, right?), he did receive 34 votes - which floored the students! The success of this approach to hands-on teaching has Ben and theSparty Partygearing up to run again in 2016. The students already have a website set up in anticipation:  www.electthebeard.com[Above: In 2016... Elect the Beard!]It has been Ben\\'sexperience that hisclassroom provides students with an amazing educational experience  but, more importantly, a safe-space where their troubles can be set aside for the 45-minute class period. Benturns history into a series of daily stories in order to show students how their own \"stories\" are important and how they are writing their own history every day.Benhasgrandiose visions of adding new uniforms and outfits to the mix, as well as continuing (and creating new) larger-than-lifeactivities.In short, everything hedoes, creates, and wears in, hedoes for hisstudents andin hisneverendingpursuit ofmaking history come\"alive\".Students of all walks of life can (and do) benefit from this kind of approach. Students that are visual learners, students that are hands-on learners, students that are English Language Learners, students that require Special Education services, and students that need that little extra kick of motivation flourish in Ben\\'s classroom. This, in turn, produces students that are excited about education and creates a wonderful atmosphere not only in Room #135, but around the high school and community.However, after 15 years, wehave run out of the personal funds to continue running Ben\\'sclassroom at such an interactive level. To date, wehave spent $68,277 of ourownmoney on hisclassroom and students. In fact, just the other night, Ben spent $80 getting this year\\'s Presidential Fight Club Championship trophies crafted and ordered. Small amounts here and there to \"spice up\" a lecture or to add something special to a student\\'s day (like spending $50 each year buying birthday pencils for his students), or paying yearly to keep the domain name on his classroom websites... it all adds up. And while every teacher spends money out-of-pocket, Ben has certainly gone well beyond basic expenditures. As such, we simply lackthe financial means anymore (and never really could afford these purchases) and kindly ask for contributionsto allow Bento continue to provide future generations with the same kindof experience that past students were able to enjoy. The cost of supplies and materials to replace and repair items in the classroom that Benbrought in or created are, understandably, not covered by the school/district.The funds generated will 100% be used for Ben\\'s classroom and school and will, in NO way, be used for any private items outside of Westerville North High School. The items purchased for his classroom will all be available for the community to view (and passed on to future teachers when Ben retires as they will be community/school/district property) and documented byreceipts and/or Purchase Orders. This money will also NOT be keptin our personal banking account; rather, it will be placed in a school/district account from which Ben will be able to withdraw (and document) any and all purchases.To read more about Ben\\'sclassroom and hisapproach to education, as well as to see additional pictures of the classroom itself and manyof his currentuniforms and activities, please visit  www.drhartnell.com. For those of you who remember Ben\\'s history and holiday \"packets\" (Lord knows I remember watching him work on those things!), he has started to \"go green\". In 2012, he launched  www.nuttyhistory.comas his ownon-line textbook, free for his students(and anyone else in the world). Since 2012, and over the course of the next few years, Ben\\'s goal is to complete the site with all of the packets he used to spend hours xeroxing and distributing to his students.

This is going to be a long, tough fight, and I have no doubt that Daphne will beat this. But along with the fight comes the expense of the travel, loss of work for Chad, incredibly steep medical bills and taking care of the house and the kids. We can help them with all of this.

       "  'As some of you may know, our younger brother Jean Paul was diagnosed with metastatic stage 4 colon cancer on June 26, 2016. JP started experiencing back and side pains a few months before his diagnosis. But with the excitement of his first child on the way, he never thought to follow up on it. It wasnt until two weeks after his daughter Serenity was born, that he would receive devastating news. JP & Marquise were home with their newborn when JP started feeling pain. This time the pains were so intense, his wife Marquise insisted on heading to the emergency room. Once there, they ran a series of tests that ultimately yielded the worst news anyone could hear. This is not supposed to happen to anyone, especially someone just blessed with a beautiful newborn to care for, love, laugh, nurture, guide, and protect. Life is filled with so many twists and turns. Although this news would knock anyone down, our brother faced it head on. What more motivation than to want to live to see your baby girl grow. He started chemotherapy two weeks later. He was feeling good. Obviously, as any aggressive treatment for cancer will do, he grew tired and weak but continued to work and provide for his family. In late February, Marquise noticed a bump on his back. Further scans revealed new tumors on his spine, hip and back. He underwent three rounds of radiation. After starting to feel pain in his neck and getting really bad headaches, they discovered he also had a tumor in his skull. At this point the radiation really wore him down. In early May, he decided to take a leave of absence from his job to concentrate on taking better care of himself by following a stricter eating regimen along with exercise. He also wanted to spend more time with Marquise and Serenity.Unfortunately, the hit and punches didnt end there. A year after the initial diagnosis, he is now undergoing the last chemo treatment they can offer him. His tumors have increased 30%. Once this treatment is complete, JPs only option is alternative medicine. This is not something that his insurance will cover and as many know, can be very expensive. This is the last option my brother and his family have. My brother is no ordinary person. He definitely carries my mothers strong bloodline and her will to fight. Just like my mother, I have yet to hear JP throughout this ordeal ask why this is happening? Why him? Why GOD, with all his power and might, would allow this to happen. He has been incredibly positive from day one. Daring this disease to take its best shot at him so he can swing back harder.JP has been blessed with many things. A highly supportive wife in Marquise, and incredible in-laws that have literally treated him as their own son. While hundreds of miles separate us, we cant help but think of our brother and what hes going through every breathing moment of our day. We wish there was something we could do to provide comfort, and ease his pain. JP is our hero. Because while we sense hes taken many chinks in his armor as a result of all hes endured to date, you wont hear him second guess the path his life has taken. We dont think, in fact know, youll meet anyone going through such a debilitating disease be as positive about things like our brother. JP continues a long uphill battle. That is why after much debate about when to put something like this together, we finally reach out to you today. We kindly ask that you keep my brother and his family in your prayers. and consider making a donation. Even with insurance, medical bills can be a huge financial burden. From doctors bills and insurance co-payments, to travel costs and lost wages. Any donation you make can be of enormous help to him and his perfect little family.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking the time to read about my brothers plight.We will continue to post updates on his development, and again thank you for thinking of our hero and baby brother, Jean Paul Tamayo.'),\n",

Molly has helped to establish many of the web standards used today by working with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Standards Project (WaSP). She worked directly with CERN, AOL, Microsoft, BBC, Opera, and Netscape to ensure browsers support modern standards. Recently, Molly has led the W3C\\'s CSS Working Group and Accessibility Community Group to emphasize the importance of inclusive design on the Internet to overcome accessibility barriers for people with disabilities. The San Francisco Chronicle named Molly Holzschlag as one of the Top 10 Most Influential Women in Technology.

All money collected from this effort will go towards medical expenses and recovery costs.What\\'s Happened to Molly? In April, Molly was diagnosed with a rare liver condition, which ravages her internal organs causing fatigue, dizziness, confusion, loss of appetite, and weakness. Immediately, Molly was put on a very restrictive diet, vitamin regimen, and chemo-therapy. According to her doctors, Molly needs to continue with another 6-9 months of chemo-therapy to go into full remission. Molly\\'s doctors told her that she could not work, while undergoing this extreme treatment.Molly was employed at the small NPO Knowbility as the Open Web Evangelist.

He was less than 1/4 from being home where the accident occurred. Alcohol was not the reason. The circumstances of the accident are unclear unfortunately. Nick suffered a traumatic brain injury which included a right sided skull fracture and brain bleeding. It is assumed he was wearing his helmet at the time of the accident (since there is damage on the helmet in the same area as his injuries) but that it fell off after the initial hit and the subsequent hits caused the damage. Nick was moved to UCI Medical Center and currently resides in the surgical ICU. He remains intubated on very heavy sedation and requires a breathing tube to help him breathe. He also has a drain placed in his head to relieve swelling and pressure build-up. He has been able to move his extremities involuntarily and his pupils react appropriately, but he is unable to respond to commands as he is under so much sedation, so the extent of the damage done to his brain cannot be fully determined at this time. The expectation is that Nick will require many weeks if not months in the hospital and even longer time potentially to rehab as he is likely to have significant physical deficits. Any monetary donations or prayers are greatly appreciated as they will all be used towards his bills, medical expenses and children since he can not work.

What is the value of a few more memories with your daughter?These are questions that we all hope will remain merely hypothetical in our lives and in the lives of our loved ones. But, they have become all too real for Paul and Vicky Duersch, who received the news on August 5, 2016 that their five year old daughter Lucy has diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). This type of cancer is only found in children, and starts in the pons area of the brainstem, which controls vital functions such as breathing and heart rate.Most children do not live more than nine months after being diagnosed. 99% of all children diagnosed with this disease do not survive more than five years. Current treatments can slow the progression of the disease, but there is no cure, and there is no expected survivorship.While we never give up hope for a miracle, we should not forget the miracle that we all have the power to create. We can band together to fill whatever time Lucy may have left in this life with a tremendous outpouring of love for her and for her family. It's sad to think of all the experiences she will not have: graduating from school, getting married, having children of her own. None of us are in a position to give her those experiences. But we can give her a powerful experience of seeing the best this world has to offer: kind-hearted, compassionate people reaching out and lifting each other's burdens.Paul and Vicky need our help. Treatments will be expensive. And even then, they don't have the ability to make these investments in the hope that they will save Lucy's life, baring a very tangible miracle. They are buying time.The funds from this campaign will be used to help cover the expense of medical bills, travel, food, missed work, and the many other costs that Paul and Vicky are going to accrue. If we are able to raise enough funds, the funds will also be used to allow Paul to take more time off from work to be with Lucy and to be a support to Vicky.The need is immediate: Lucy starts treatment on August 9th. The need is ongoing, for as long as Lucy may have left. The need may linger even past that time.Please, help us help them however you can. Even small donations will make a difference. Even just sharing this information with your contacts can make a difference. You can help us make all the difference in the world for Lucy at this time.

The public schools of Lebanon are experiencing severe contaminationin their water sources causing Lebanese and Syrian refugee children attending Lebanese public schools, to get seriously ill. Imagine if you had to worry about getting sick from something as simple as the water youre drinking at school. That should be the LAST thing a kid needs to even wonder about while seeking education. I have linked up with the Troy Rotary Foundation, a non-profit organization that connectedwith the 24 united Rotary clubs of Lebanon to provide clean water to the 1,535 public schools across the country. Over 200 public schools have received their filters in addition to hygiene training for students and staff members. My goal is to raise $5,000 in order to bring clean water to two more schools. Each public school has roughly 400 Lebanese students that attend the morning session of school hours, and 400 Syrian students that attend the same school in the afternoon. This means bringing clean water to 1,600 kids every single day. So it works a little something like this: ittakes $2,500 to replace old water tanks in each public school and to purify the water with new filters. Your donation would be directly going towards reaching this amount.There is not an investment like this that would give you such a rewarding return.  Truth be told, whenI initially signed upto run The Detroit Free Press/Talmer Bank Marathon on October 19th, I did it with the intention of fulfilling a task on my bucket list, but now it means way more than that.

       "  'Community Renewal Team\\'s (CRT) current flagship project \"Veterans Landing\" will be an affordable assisted living residence for low- to moderate-income older military veterans and their spouses. It will be located on the Newington campus of the VA Connecticut Healthcare System. The 103-apartment community will be one of the nation\\'s first assisted living residences exclusively for aging veterans. Fees will remain affordable while veterans enjoy the same services and amenities associated with traditional assisted living homes (meals, medication monitoring, laundry, housekeeping, grooming, bathing, on-site/off-site activities, transportation, etc.).There are about 24 million veterans in the United States, and 3.5 million of these veterans are over the age of 65. Clearly, the need for assisted living is growing by the day. In Connecticut, there are 229,700 veterans and they make up 8% of the state\\'s population, and 23% of its homeless population. The bulk of these veterans were in service during the Vietnam era, and as they approach their 60s, 70s, and 80s+, their need for assisted living care quickly increases.According to the U.S. Department of Defense, over 14,000 Connecticut service men and women have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001; and there are nearly 9,000 active duty military personnel from Connecticut. As these men and women age, their need for assisted living will increase, particularly due to severe physical and psychological injuries.So how are we caring for our veterans who are seniors, and more so, our low-income veterans? How are we caring for veterans who are soon to become seniors or retirees? And how are we caring for veterans with disabilities who might only require limited support? Veterans Landing is the answer, the starting point, and most important, the model for communities across the nation. Your donation will be a first step in a larger fundraising campaign to support the development and building of this residence, which is slated for groundbreaking in 2015.Many veterans feel more at ease and at home when sharing their time with other military veterans. CRT\\'s focus is to help veterans stay as independent and vibrant as possible \" mentally and physically \" so they may enjoy life to the fullest. Veterans Landing will offer handicap-accessible studio or one-bedroom apartments, both with kitchenettes and private baths; a chapel; Internet caf; library; general store; computer lab; on-site/off-site activities, dining room; and many other supports and resources.We believe in a better retirement for military veterans. Do you? Please donate today. Our Veterans Landing Advisory Council, Trustees, and staff appreciate your commitment and help.

       "  \"*** LENDonate was recently featured on ABC News! ***Message from the Founder of LENDonate In 2015, I was looking for a way to support nonprofits beyond what I could afford to donate, and in a way that my money could be recycled for social good. Since I couldn't find that perfect solution, I decided to build it with a team of passsionate experts who are as eager to revolutionize social finance as I am. Will you please help us reach the next milestone?\\n\\nWhat We DoWe help nonprofits with big goals receive the financial investments they need. Our platform also creates new possibilities for lenders and donors to connect their investment and social impact goals. If you haven't already, please watch our short and fun animation video above to see how we do it.Why We Need Your HelpWe are ready to grow and bring more nonprofits onto our platform! With additional funding, we can proactively reach out and assist nonprofits with their funding plans. Please support us and share this with your friends and nonprofits!*** We appreciate every donation, no matter the amount. The more we raise, the faster we can expand and better our services. ***Benefits to Nonprofit BorrowersBy making funding more accessible, nonprofits can focus even more on serving the community than on fundraising. Benefits to Lender/DonorDonors desire choice and flexibility. Changing circumstances affect donors' abilities to give, but they want their nonprofits to continue to receive adequate support to continue their good work. LENDonate lenders fund a nonprofit through a loan and then have the opportunity to easily convert loan to donation anytime during the life of the loan enabling them to strategically plan their giving.Why Do Nonprofits Need to Borrow?Like us, sometimes there are emergency situations, such as a leaky roof or natural disaster recovery that needs immediate attention. A short-term, low-cost loan may be just the fix. Or a big project might come alongsay, relocating to a new building, where a loan is critical to its successful completion. Access to funds at competitive rates ought to be available to nonprofits whenever appropriate.*** Did you know nonprofits don't just rely on donations and grants? As a sector, it actually earns over 70% of their revenue, e.g. tuition, ticket sales, etc. Also, 75% of them operate at or above breakeven.***Examples of Nonprofits We Funded1) An education nonprofit needed to pay deposits to vendors for an upcoming fundraiser. Rather than taking money from programs or putting it on credit card, they sourced a 2.9% interest bridge loan on LENDonate, along with $700 in donations. They ended up raising 6X what they borrowed!2) An arts nonprofit had a 13% interest bank line of credit, and we replaced it with a 3.6% interest only loan that was secured by a grant receivable. Additionally they received over $5,000 in donations during the campaign.Who We AreLENDonate is a committed team of people with over 100 years of collective experience in the financial and nonprofit sectors. Together, we are fostering the next generation of impact investing. We are here to power your mission.Our marketplace lending platform is a unique network where individuals, foundations, impact investors, banks and nonprofits leverage their collective power for the greater good. Nonprofit borrowers can showcase their programs on LENDonate to efficiently receive needed capital to reach their next milestone.********************** fine print ************************- This is not a solicitation of investment.- Donation to LENDonate is not tax deductible.\"),\n",

The day that everything changed.\\n\\n\\nMy dear husband, Adam, is a full-time firefighter/paramedic for the Houston Fire Department as well as the Channelview Fire Department. Yes, you heard right. My hardworking husband works96 hours a week so that our children can be raised by & loved on by me, their momma, all day.\\n\\n\\nFor the past year & a half we have renovated our home out of our own pockets & much of it with our own two hands. We had big dreams & plans of paying off all of our debt with the equityin our home which would allow my husband to quit one job & get to spend more time with his 3 girls.\\n\\n\\nWe were weeks away from putting our house on the market when Hurricane Harvey hit just 4 days ago.\\n\\n\\nAround 11:45pm while the storm raged outside I anxiously watched the water collect in our street, pour over our sidewalk & into our driveway. I had never even seen water pool in our street much less flood. This struck some fear in me.\\n\\n\\nI stayed up to watch the news & monitor the water levels until it stopped raining around 1:30 a.m. That\\'s when I decided it would be a good time to try to rest. I laid in bed feeling heavy with fear for 30 minutes. All the while there was only light rain.Thinking, \"SURELY the water has gone down, I will go take one last look & it will give me the peace of mind I need to sleep for a few hours.\"\\n\\n\\nWrong! I walked out to find that the water had risen so high it was inches from being in our garage. I knew we were going to flood at that point & ran to wake Adam.\\n\\n\\nWe immediately began putting everything we could on top of countertops, furniture & folding tables.\\n\\n\\nLiving in a one-story house meant the attic was our only refuge (aside from sitting on the roof).\\n\\n\\nWe knew that we would need a way out if it rose too high, so we grabbed an axe, crowbar, hammer & hacksaw & put them in the attic first. Followed by plywood so we wouldn\\'t have to balance on the beams, flashlights, water, diapers & wipes, important documents,medications, a pack \\'n play to contain the kids, some folding chairs, bug spray, sunscreen, extra clothes & food.\\n\\n\\nOur youngest has a rare life-threatening food allergy condition called FPIES (Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome), so as water was pouring into our house around 2:30 a.m. we were boiling potatoes & eggs to make sure we had enough safe foods inthe attic for Hazel should we be there for a long time.\\n\\n\\nOnce we had everything we could think of (around 3:30 a.m.) we grabbed the girls & dogs & I went up to the attic with them. Adam continued to grab everything he thought may be useful to us.\\n\\n\\nJust before joining us in the attic, Adam shut off the main breaker so we wouldn\\'t have to worry about electrical currents in the water/electrical fires.\\n\\n\\nOur neighbor, Bobbie called. She was crying. They had a few inches of water in their home & didn\\'t know what to do. I instructed them to do just was we did. Go to the attic with tools to get on the roof, food & water, shut off the electricity & then Iprayed with her & tried to assure her we would get through it.\\n\\n\\nBy 4:00 a.m. we had between 6 & 8 inches of water in the house.\\n\\n\\nPresley was scared of the attic & kept asking to get in her bed. It was heartbreaking. We just kept assuring her we were safe & prayed together as a family.\\n\\n\\nThe water slowed down some so we tried to rest.\\n\\n\\nWe actually had called 911 when the water first started rushing into the house, because we knew things weren\\'t looking so good based on the rate the water was rising. At 4:08 we called again. We were put on hold at one point & told we were already on thelist. I asked how long they thought it would take & the dispatcher said, \"I don\\'t know. We just don\\'t have the resources. Someone was just rescued out of a house with 12 feet of water in it.\"\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s when we realized it would probably be a while.\\n\\n\\nSo we prayed and we prayed and we prayed some more. We thanked God for each breath we had been given. We thanked Him for our children. We prayed for rescue & we prayed that the glory would all be His.\\n\\n\\nAround 6 a.m. we were exhausted & feeling helpless. The water was about 18 inches deep in the house. No sign of rescue. Adam sent out a desperate plea to the guys from HFD for help. We cried. And then Adam decided to do something about it.\\n\\n\\nHe got busy cutting a hole in our roof so we could get out & hopefully be spotted by rescue.\\n\\n\\nOnce he finished our\\'s he went next door & cut a hole in their roof.\\n\\n\\nFor the next few hours Adam went around looking for help & looking for anyone he could help.\\n\\n\\nI stayed in the attic with the girls. God gave me an overwhelming sense of peace that we would be rescued, but you can\\'t help but think about the alternative in that situation. I decided to sing songs of praise to God as loud as I possibly could & I wept.I wept for my girls.\\n\\n\\nNothing can prepare a parent for the agony of knowing your children are in danger & you can\\'t save them, because you\\'re in need of saving, too. I kept looking at their angelic faces & telling them how much I loved them & how precious they are.\\n\\n\\nJust before 7:00 a.m. the sun came up. We could hear boats. In fact one spotted Adam while he was out in the water.\\n\\n\\nBy 8 a.m. the water is probably 2.5 feet deep in the house & I finally had a chance to look out on the roof. I couldn\\'t believe what I saw. Our entire neighborhood was engulfed by the creek. My van was halfway submerged & Adam\\'s Civic wasn\\'t even visible.\\n\\n\\nBy 8:30 I was spending more time on the roof looking for rescue boats. We saw several, but the people closest to the creek were priority.\\n\\n\\nFinally around 9:00 a.m. a boat passed & we waved & yelled out to them that we had babies. They asked how many & the ages & immediately came to our rescue. I went into the attic to get everything we needed to take with us.\\n\\n\\nI heard someone climb through the hole & assumed it was Adam. I called out to him & looked up to see a Friendwood firefighter. My heart nearly leapt out of my chest. We were really being rescued! My babies would be okay!\\n\\n\\nI crawled the girls over to the escape hole & they got them down into the boat. Then came the dogs & then came myself, with a select few necessities.\\n\\n\\nWe went next door for my husband & the crew to rescue our neighbor. Once she was safely in the boat they ferried my husband across the street so he could help an elderly neighbor get to higher ground.\\n\\n\\nHe stayed with her while we were boated to dry land.\\n\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until we got to the Click2Houston van that I realized our neighborhood was one of the worst in Houston (at the time). Considering we weren\\'t in a flood zone & never flooded I just assumed it was widespread devastation everywhere.\\n\\n\\nShortly after I was interviewed.\\n\\n\\n https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.60.2/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/2031081/uiconf_id/36217061/entry_id/0_x4pxcwj8?wid=_2031081&iframeembed=true&playerId=media-preview_4_0_x4pxcwj8&entry_id=0_x4pxcwj8&flashvars%5BstreamerType%5D=auto\\n\\nWe spent that night with friends who took us in, clothed & fed us.\\n\\n\\nWe are now staying with my parents until our housing situation is worked out.

The last 28 years have been filled with challenges, but this last one has thrown me for a loop. Having a caregiver poison me was totally unexpected to say the least. This has created a financial impossibility temporarily. My budget can afford a live in caregiver, which I'm searching for, but I am forced to hire an agency (much more expensive) until a permanent caregiver can be hired. I was referred to an excellent agency that is charging me $13.50 an hour, which is cheap for an agency. While I negoiated a good rate agency that is $324 a day to stay alive. Blows my weekly caregiver budget in two days. I'm not worth it beyond what I can't pay for.. I humbly ask for a handout. I am sorry. I thought I had made myself financially independent to fund my existence I just didn't calculate someone poisoning me. Thank you so much so very much for your consideration.

Aleshia is bruised, has a broken elbow,  a broken hand, facial contusions and road rash all over her body. Kaiden has two broken arms, a terrible torn up foot that will need plastic surgery, and has a laceration  that has been stapled on his head. Mike and Aleshia's unborn child is doing very well, and fighting hard like his daddy would want him to.

       "  'I thank you first of all for taking the time to click on this link and hopefully help me save my dog Mila\\'s life. Previous to June 27th of this year 2015, my baby girl who\\'s only 4 years old was happy, playful, energetic, super hyper, loved running and to know her is to fall in love with her as many of you have without even ever meeting her, now she\\'s a ticking time bomb.I had taken her to a private boarding on June 23rd and was to pick her up at 4pm on June 27th. She had been to this boarding many times before with up to 14 other dogs at times ranging from all breeds, pitbulls, shepards, wolf dogs, little dogs etc. without incident. She is my documented companion animal, very loving, sweet, cuddle buddy and thinks she\\'s a 60lb lap dog.I got the call from the owner of the boarding at 1:30pm just almost 2 hours before I was supposed to pick her up. He said there had been a \"situation\" and Mila was injured and it was serious I needed to get over there asap. At this moment I didn\\'t have a vehicle but I was there within 30 minutes. When I got there I first saw the dog who attacked Mila and that dog had one injury to its forhead. I was brought around to the side of the house to where Mila was to find her stapled up and full of wounds, scared and shaking. The owner who is not a vet had taken it upon himself to staple her up without my permission. How he stapled her up I till this day do not know whether it was humane or not. He refused immediately to pay for any vet bills or give me any information to contact the owners of the dog who attacked Mila. I never signed any paper work of any sort including releasing him from any liability. By the time I got home I looked and documented every bite and wound she had and she had over 25, till this day I still find more I missed. She had wounds all over her body literally, arms, feet, hind legs, back, right side, left side, face, ears, behind her ears, armpits, chest, belly, between her hind legs and her neck. I don\\'t know how one dog (Mila) could have almost 30 wounds and one dog (other dog) have one. Well, I\\'ll tell you she\\'s doesn\\'t know how to fight, I know rare for a pitbull but that shows you the character of my dog and nobody must have been watching them for that long of an attack to occur.Since the attack my Mila is a completley different dog! She\\'s been not only super traumatized by the attack but also serverely ill from complications relating back to the attack. Within a week from the attack she got servere edema in her neck the size of a tennis ball (caused by a bite or punture wound to the neck) and what we thought was kennel cough, we now know was a misdiagnoses. Her edema has spread through out her entire body, between her 2 last vet visits which was last week she gained 4lbs in water wait over 3 days. Her health was rapidily deteriorating. Her last vet visit was this past Sunday July12th in which the Dr. took an x-ray of her lungs, which we found fluid between her lungs and chest cavity. The Dr. said \"Do Not Take Her Home, you will wake up to a Dead Dog\", she was slowly dying drowning in her own lil body. He sent us to West LA ASEC Emergency Hospital where that night they drained 880ml from her right lung which was already partially collasped due to the pressure of the fluid and 400ml from her left side. They kept Mila overnight in the ICU. They did alot of extensive tests and all her major organs are healthy, heart, kidneys, bladder, white/red cell count etc. So how this fluid got there is unknown but what is known is until we figure out how she\\'s filling up with this fluid, it will keep filling up and keep needing to be drained, its just a matter of time. Which today July 16th I think it already started to fill back up because she\\'s showing the same signs as she did this past Sunday. So why I need your help is to continue being able to drain the fluid out of her chest cavity so she dosen\\'t drown in her own body and do more extensive tests to try and find the source of how the fluid is getting in there. One therory is due to the massive trauma from the attack and the servere edema, her heart couldn\\'t keep up with all the fluid and got backed up pushing fluid into her chest cavity. But now that its happened its going to keep happening until the Dr.\\'s figure this out. And we all know vet hospitals aren\\'t like people hospitals, even thou they knew my dog would die, without any sort of down payment this past Sunday night they would have sent me home and my Mila would be dead.I\\'ve had my own health issues, almost losing my left leg to compartment syndrome with a mrsa infection the end of last year, which most of you followed and I thank you for the love and support you showed me. Fortunately, through 4 leg surgeries they were able to save my leg and I\\'m still recoverying from that. I thought about doing a gofundme account for myself last year but you know what I can make payments or arrangements to pay those debts (which are huge) but my dog can\\'t and vets won\\'t accept payments or arrangements; that\\'s why this is an urgent matter of life and death for Mila. That\\'s why I am starting this account. I hope that you find it in your heart to help me save my dog Mila\\'s life. I just want my old Mila back, it breaks my heart to see her so lethargic, in pain and suffering.I thank you in advance for every and any penny, nickel, dime, quarter or dollar you can donate.Thank You..Evita & Mila Padilla'),\n",

It will tell you about what Pinky has been through and how George andEsther rescued her. After reading the stubbydog link, please come back to this page to read about our cause. This story and cause is very real and we\\'re running out of time. If you would like, please message me on facebook with any questions... http://stubbydog.org/2012/08/pinkys-homecoming/Pinky currently has a cancerous melanomatumor in her jaw. She has had many treatments (nutritional, medicinal, holistic and homeopathic) to erradicate the tumor and stop the cancer from spreading which has been very successful. She has responded fabulously with zero signs of metastasis although unfortunately the tumor in her jaw is back. Fortunately, Pinky\\'s oncologist is very confident that with one more advanced RT treatment andCAT scan (to first digitally map the tumor), he will finally erradicate the tumor. This new procedure usually costs $10,000, but the doctor believes in its success so much and also understands Pinky\\'s Dad\\'s financial position, that he has agreed to charge half, only $5,000 (the cost of the CAT scan + RT). Cutting the cost in half helps prove Pinky\\'s oncologist\\'s confidence and optimism. We are all now very optimistic that through digitally mapping the tumor and re-focusing a new advanced RT treatment, this time, we will finally eradicate the tumor in her jaw for good. Its also important to reiterate that there is zero signs of cancer anywhere else in her body so killing the tumor in her jaw will greatly extend her life and rid her of the pain she is currently experiencing. The problem is that her Daddy has used all of their savings for her medical bills so far and cannot pay for this final treatment. She will die without it and she is such an important member of the family that we all cannot bear to lose her. So as George\\'s extended family, we are all stepping in to help any way we can. The tumor is currently starting to purge through her gums, so we have very little time to help.I am including pictures of Pinkyso you can see how wonderful and full of life she is. George takes her everywhere with him... even to his office. Everyone loves her where ever she goes. She is gentle, loving and good with kids. She absolutely ADORES her \"daddy\" and doesn\\'t want to be even an inch away from him.The money will pay for the RT treatment, Xrays, medications, office visits and the required CAT scan.We will be beyond thankful for any help we can get to save Pinky. Please understand that this is a real situation and we are good people, its just that our backs are up against the wall because of time. Pinky will not make it another month without the treatment which it would take us far longer to save for. Pinky\\'s daddy has also already maxed out all his credit cards and even Care Credit for veterinary care. A friend told me about this site, and I couldn\\'t believe how many good people are willing to help a stranger in their desperate time of need for a good cause. There is no time for our family to save the money for this treatment because Pinky will not survive that long! But you have our heartfelt promise to pay this kindness forward when we are able to save the money. We will continue to follow this site and help others as we have been helped.

       "  'Around noon today, Saturday 5/27, I came across this brown and white pit who I have been calling buddy. Buddy took a nasty blow to the face via train down on campbell street here in Sandusky and was abandoned by his owners. X-rays show that his organs and bones are intact, he has a small fracture in his jaw and a large laceration above his eye.He was rushed to the Animal Emergency hospital in Lorain and has been receiving treatment since. Fluid IV, pain medication and sedation, x-rays and blood work have been administered and when the swelling goes down he is to have surgery to get his eye closed back up. The staff here has been nothing short of amazing, treating this little guy to the best of their abilities and showing him a whole lot of love.Buddies owners had been relatively indifferent throughout this process and had left him to die. In a conversation with the Lorain Sheriff it was revealed that one family member had purposely released him in hopes that he would be struck by a car. The owner then stated they will not be making it to the animal hospital due to \"anxiety\" and that Buddy should just be put down instead of saving his life.There are several more details that are less than savvy and the animal hospital chose to involve the police. Control of buddy was ultimately relinquished to me giving me full right to make decisions on his behalf. Buddy was able to stand and although the extent of his head trauma is still being reviewed, the vets were highly optimistic and surprised with what his x-rays showed. This guy was not ready to give up!He was extremely malnourished and obviously neglected prior to this accident, but a full healthy recovery is expected.This situation was truly humbling in so many ways. I am asking for donations to keep Buddies treatment going and help him on the road to recovery. Any little bit will help. He has a ranged estimate for his stay between 1600-2222. This does not include any follow up appointments. Any proceeds that exceed his bill will be directly donated back to the Animal Emergency Hospital.Once Buddy has made a full recovery he will be accepting visitors and could potentially be adopted into a caring home! At no point through this ordeal did he seem agressive, but thankful and submissive. He was great with myself and the vets. Lily and I are excited to get to know him and welcome him cautiously into our place for his recovery.Please spread the word! It is important to keep in mind that although dogs are \"property\" in the state of Ohio legally, we should respect the unconditional love they provide.

The recommendation short term was to watch and see if issues increased or decreased being that some conditions causing these symptoms go away on their own.In less than 24 hours this has turn into a nightmare. Mike and I came home to find Elvis standing in front of the door esentially screaming. We rushed him to the ER and have been told the most likely scenario is a brain tumor. They need to do an MRI to verify but won't be able to do that until Monday. We have brought Elvis home and he is currently next to me on the bed snoring. To be bluno, we're poor. A few hundred dollars is something we can scrape together but not thousands. Elvis means more to us than life and we will do anything to help him. I know it's a lot of money but if anyone can help us, help Elvis, please do. Elvis is a great little man. Please help.\"),\n",

As a baby he was left out in some extreme temperatures and sustained frostbite on his feet. The cruel \"breeders\" decided the best option was to chop off his toes with an axe or other crude obect. Brutus was left mamed and crippled and due to the poor way in which this was done, he is in pain every day of his life. He cannot run and play like all puppieswant to do, he can barely walk. He has to be carried over any hard surfaces or up and down stairs. He was taken in by a family who loves him very much but are not equipped for the challenges that face Brutus every day. We are raising money to correct the wrong that has been done to this amazing dog. He has had a consultation and is a prime candidate for prothetics. Please check out Orthopets in Denver, CO to see the amazing things they are doing. Please join us and together we will give this dog the life he deserves. One that is not full of pain and suffering. Together we will see this gentle giant run for the first time in his life. He will play, he will no longer be trapped in a body that was purposely and cruelly disfigured. Brutus is pure heart!

       "  'Updated 12/19: As a result of being featured on Channel 13 last night, an anonymous donor directly donated $1,000 to VCA. We are completely overjoyed and humbled. There are no words to describe how amazing this is. As a result, I am returning our goal to $5,000. Channel 13 Feature on Sgt. Mabel! PLEASE CONTINUE TO SHARE!! Updated 12/18: The final bills are in and just under $6k. I have raised the goal to exactly $6k to account for the 5% gofundme charges and the 2.9% fee the money handling processor charges. I have all receipts for your review.Last night I arrived at VCA to a police car, two vet staff, and a distraught disabled army veteran helping load her belived service dog Sergeant Mabel out of the car and onto a pet gurney for emergency care. Sadly, Sgt. Mabel got out of her new yard and was struck by a car and seriously injured. God spoke to me clearly and said, \"Her. Help her.\" Once inside, Mabel was rushed off for evaluation and it became clear very quickly that her soldier mom wasn\\'t at all prepared to handle the burden of what was to happen financially to get her best friend and service animal back on her feet. I tell this not to elevate myself, but because I\\'ve learned to follow the voice when I\\'m told to go and do. Trusting fully that it would all get worked out I handed my credit card to the front desk staff and said do what you need to do. After a long night where I learned much about both Sgt. Mabel and her mom, the initial diagnosis and cost estimates came back. The news is positive-or at least repairable-but the costs are going to be incredible. Mabel needs two surgeries to surgically put her elbow and hips back into place as they are badly dislocated. The cost of last nights stay in ICU is estimated to be around $2,000 (I paid the $900 deposit) and the surgery estimate is between $5,000 and $7,000. I\\'m happy to provide them to anyone who would like to check them out. These costs are simply not something Sgt. Mabel\\'s mom can bear and I am committed to keeping my promise to help get Mabel back on her feet and back on duty-whatever it takes. I pray that you find it in your heart to join me in this profound leap of faith and donate to Mabel\\'s care. Mabel is needed and loved and provides comfort and protection for her mom both emotionally and physically and I will cover it all of that\\'s how it ends up. I just know in my heart that there are others who will help, so any amount is deeply apppteciated. God bless you and thank you. Mabel\\'s mom is mortified by the need to ask for financial help, but humbled and grateful. Thank you in advance and God bless you.'),\n",

       "  'Thursday night we got the call that no \"parent\" ever wants to get. Our child is in the hospital and is under going life threatning surgery. At midnight on Friday morning Rupa was put under to address severe bite trauma on her stomach, chest, back, and hind leg. This surgery lasted nearly 4 hours with positive thoughts coming from the doctors, her \"parents\", friends, and family. Since the surgery Rupa was transported from the Green Bay animal hospital to Appleton for observation. Her blood glucose and white blood cell counts were and are the major issue to this point. Last night she was given a dose of plasma to hopefully see an upswing in those numbers. We found out this morning it\\'s working! Rupa\\'s doctors declared that she will have to go in for surgery for a second time this afternoon, Saturday. She has fluids building up where the laserations were closed up. Rupa may also need a CT scan to check for nerve and spinal damage. She will be on many different antibiotics for several weeks as well as pain meds to help ease her while recovering. As dog parents this is something we never thought we would have to go through and are at a complete loss. While this fight goes on back in the states, Amber and I are in Mexico waiting for an emergency flight back home to help deal with all of this. So far we believe the cost to be closing in on eight thousand dollars. This bill must be paid up front, no questions asked. We have maxed out credit cards and have reached out to family. Absolutely anything will help. I believe in going back to our roots where leaning on people when in need is an okay gesture. We are leaning for Rupa.Now this isn\\'t our blood born child but Rupa is our happiest mammal in the morning, travel the country with us, would do anything to make us smile \"child\". Anyone that knows rupa understands the unconditional love she shares. We are asking you to help us fight for a pup that is not even four years old and has been tested time and time again yet still loves no matter what. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you all for at least taking a look at this post. Positive vibes from all of us!Ryan, Amber & Rupa'),\n",

       "  'Save a Throw-Away DogNone of my dogs will go hungry tonight, but everyday is an increasing struggle. All of these loving animals have a sad story to tell, but Im here to focus on creating a happy future once they arrive on my doorstep-surrendered by owners who choose not to care for them anymore. I have been saving throw-away dogs, neglected, abused, ignored and untrained, and making them happy, healthy and ready to be on their way to a better life as an alternative to euthanization. Unfortunately, I have reached full capacity at my facility for quite a while, and since there are far more canine guests than homes to place them, I am struggling to maintain the level of care, they deserve. I must keep a dog for as long as it takes to find the right adopter, so I now turn to you for help in supporting our cause. Im Frank M. Allison from Rocks Positive K-9 Training. I have trained dogs for over 30 years with a specialty in behavior problems that include anti-social dogs. Many of these relinquished dogs can be rehabilitated and placed into loving homes, but unfortunately, some can never be adopted out and I will support them in my facility for their lifetime. One hundred percent of all donations will go to the dogs to provide food, veterinary care, and a clean, safe environment. All of these dogs are kept at my facility full time recovering from whatever theyve been through, while repairing their mind frame through training and socialization. For the first time in my 30+ years of training, Im turning to the caring public to join my fight to provide these poor animals that didnt deserve their fate, a new lease on life. Every dollar for the dogs will be greatly appreciated and please be aware you have my heartfelt gratitude. For those of you who can see your way to a $75 or more donation, we would be honored to send you a copy of my training book Allisons American Way of Dog Training as an additional thank you if you would supply us with your mailing address.'),\n",

       "  'I rescued Fred in June of 2015. I picked him because he wasn\\'t what most may consider to be \"cute\".. plus his breath could scare cockroaches away. His jaw was broken, completely sideways, and his tongue hung out. Fred was previously abused, and was used as a BAIT DOG in dog fighting. Yet in the 2 minutes within meeting him, I knew I had to have him. I\\'d never met a more loving, affectionate pup until those moments. I first started by treating his heartworms (which the rescue told me he did not have, and then later admitted that they\\'d never even tested him for heartworms.) Next on my list was a dental cleaning. I knew my little best friend would feel so much better with a clean mouth! That was the beginning of a downward spiral. That day, Fred had 11 teeth removed, partial jaw removal, and also an unexpected mast cell tumor removal (which is cancerous.) I paid $500 that day. A week later, Fred\\'s stitches came out, leading me to pay $150 for another visit. A month later Fred started bleeding from the mouth, and acting strangely.. I knew something was terribly wrong. I took him to the vet.. and they said they didn\\'t see anything but charged me $70 and sent home some pain meds. Two days later, the strange behavior got worse. I called the vet again. They referred me to a specialist. I was told that it was urgent and needed to be seen the following day.. right before Christmas. That day, Fred went in for a consultation and three hours later came out with half his mouth removed and left me with a $3,000 bill. Fred\\'s dental emergency has gotten me in way over my head. He had multiple issues that needed to be addressed that were not expected. Exposed nerves, removal of all but 3 teeth, root rot, a punctured tongue, broken jaw, & teeth going into his nasal cavity were only some of the issues. The $3,000 surgery alone was hard to stomach but now there are other little road bumps popping up. Some might call me stupid for spending this much on a dog, but my intentions were to pay for it myself and I can admit that I bit off more than I could chew. All I wanted was to save this dog, Fred, my best buddy. There was no need and no talk of putting him down, because he\\'s too young and the specialist told me countless times that when this blows over he will live a much happier, healthier quality of life. I\\'m actually embarrassed that I\\'ve had to resort to this because I told myself I\\'d never resort to this.. and I don\\'t expect to raise much but I figure it\\'s worth a shot. If you choose to help me, I thank you, and Fred thanks you. '),\n",

       "  \"On a beautiful Monday evening, July 10th, my neighbors Elyse and Zach Smith were taking a pleasant stroll near The Castaways with their rescued Afghan Hound....STELLA. They were almost home when they came upon a man running with a Pit Bull. Elyse and Zach paused to let them run by however, once the Pit Bull had passed the Smith's, the Pit Bull turned around and began viciously attacking them with Stella taking the brunt of the attack. Zach made every attempt to intervene as he cuffed Stella's neck while they both attempted to push away the Pit Bull. Elyse and Zach suffered multiple bites to their arms, hands and legs and suffered dislocated and broken fingers... All the while....the man who was running with the dog DID NOTHING! Once the Smith's were able to separate the two dogs, the man and the Pit Bull ran off leaving them screaming for help and bleeding. A good Samaritan stopped to help, and they loaded Stella into their car and rushed her to the Emergency Vet. Stella underwent emergency surgery that evening. Stella's leg is shattered in three places and has severed tendons, muscles and arteries. This will be the first of many surgeries and urgent care for her. I am reaching out to the community to ask that we help support the Smith's with the unsurmountable (and unexpected) costs they will be facing, as a result of this tragedy. Any amount is so very much appreciated and will help offset the ER and operating expenses. STELLA'S STORY...She and some other puppies were turnedover to Afghan Hound Rescue of Southern California, Inc. 9 months ago.The rescue coordinator brought Stella to Zach and Elyse for foster care as a puppy, and they immediately fell in love with her. They had just rescued Lenny (Afghan Hound) from China, and they knew they had to keep Stella in their lives. Stella is a certified therapy dog and volunteers with foster children and teens monthly. Elyse teaches a training g class for free a few times a year to help people certify their dogs so they can volunteer in our community. She is amazing with kids...quiet, patient and so so sweet.Stella was rushed to the Central Orange County Emergency Vet on July 10th where she went into her first surgery. The next day she was transfered to Veterinary Specialist Services Orange County (VSSOC) where they stabilized her and Stella's vet Dr. Sebestyen performed a several hour long surgery reconstructing her leg with titanium plates, screws and bone putty fusion. LET'S GET STELLA BACK ON ALL FOURS!\"),\n",

Errin and Chris were two individuals who found the joy and beauty in every moment they lived. They found happiness in everything they did - from watching their children grow to walks in their neighborhood. They were two of the most gracious people I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. They were kind and generous, opening their home to their friends and treating them as family, without question. If you ever needed anything, Errin and Chris were the people you called. They would give what they could and help in any way they knew how. Errin would give the shirt off her back. Chris would drop what he was doing to help the ones he loved. The two of them together were beautiful; their relationship full of laughter and light. Together, they brought Theodore and Ariella into this world. The four of them together was a sight to be seen - a family so full of love and light. Errin and Chris were amazing parents, doing everything for their children.Chris was an Infantry Staff Sergeant who served with honor and dignity at his base at Joint Base Lewis McChord. Prior to being stationed at JBLM he was a member of the Old Guard in Washington D.C.Errin was a dedicated wife, mother and friend who\\'s presence will be missed every single day. She was known to be able to make anyone smile and she loved her family and friends tremendously.Ariella was the most spirited child. She was funny and smart, vibrant and headstrong. She was a light all on her own, one that shone so brightly when you entered a room. She was nurturing in her ways, with a lot of sass and strong will to go with it. She was unlike any other child I\\'ve ever known. She was a beautiful little girl, who just shined brightly with the love from her family.The youngest of all her friends, she was always able to keep up with the big kids.Losing them suddenly has knocked the breath out of everyone that loved them. Chris, a dedicated solider, husband, and father. Errin, one of the most amazing wives and mother. Ariella, a child that was meant for greatness. We all mourn the loss of the three of them.Car accidentschange lives, and in this case, it took the lives of these three wonderful individuals, and left Theodore without his parents and his sister. We are all in disbelief, but stand united with Theodore and the rest of the family.Unfortunately, the funeral costs for Errin and Ariella are not covered by the military as they were not enrolled in family life insurance. This go fund me was created to ease the burden on Leesa, Chris\\'s mother, who is responsible for the services.

Friday afternoon, the day after Thanksgiving 2016, our son, Conor, had a few friends over to go to the trampoline park, eat pizza, and spend the night. While they were waiting to go to the trampoline park, they went to the next cul-de-sac to wheel around. Conor was on his longboard, and came down the hill. When he turned the corner, he hit some wet leaves and skidded. When the leaves ended, so did the skid, launching Conor off his board. He hit the back of his head on the road and was knocked unconscious. His friends called us and 911 at the same time. Conor was taken to the local hospital and then to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. At the hospital, they performed a CT scan which showed a skull fracture and two brain bruises. He didn't break anything else, just the most important part! The trauma staff and neurosurgical staff were confident that Conor's injury was recoverable given a few days. But although his CT scans showed the injury was stable, Conor's cranial pressure never stabilized. After 6 days, Conor required surgery to relieve his pressure. He nearly died on the way to the operating room. The neurosurgeon was confident the procedure was successful. It didn't work though, and a second surgery was required.  In this surgery, the neurosurgeon saw bruising all over Conor's brain, and stated that it was more consistent with high velocity impact rather than a skateboarding accident. His injury was massive head trauma, and it was inevitably unrecoverable.At 4:26 PM 12/5/2016, Conor passed away peacefully at Connecticut Children's Medical Clinic. 14 Years 7 Months 2 Days will never be long enough.We did not have life insurance for him, and we have no more family savings while Whit has been unemployed, trying to shift careers. He was only 14 years old and shouldn't have been taken from us. We don't want him to be forgotten because he was so full of life and had SO much potential.We know entire communities rallied for his recovery. People we didn't know prayed for him. Multiple schools in the region held days in which the students dressed up for Conor, like Conor did. He dressed up for school, wearing dress shirts and bow ties 2-3 times a week. And we cannot tell you how much that support has meant.He was an outstanding cross country runner in only two years of running. As an 8th grader in his first season of cross country, he took 22nd in the state. And as a Freshman, he lettered on a strong Ledyard Connecticut cross country team this year. We want to build a fund to help a cross country runner or more to join the High School team, or to help the team directly itself. Please help us create a fitting memorial for a beautiful boy.\"),\n",

Winter is coming and it's already getting too cold to camp which drives people away from the encampment.We stand with Standing Rock and the Sacred Stone Encampment and were here today to help those at the front lines stay warm so they may continue their peaceful acts of protection. ABOUT THE MOVEMENT: After the failed Keystone Pipeline, a new and virtually regulation free Dakota Access Pipeline was approved. Energy Transfer Partners was awarded the right to build a pipeline. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) will be built on top of several burial grounds and sacred sites - some of which have already been decimated by Energy Transfer Partners employees back in September. Energy Transfer Partners plans to build the pipeline under the Missouri River which is the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Reservation and several outlying communities. If this pipeline were to burst or leak  drinking water would be contaminated - potentially all the way down the Missouri River to the Mississippi and on into the Gulf of Mexico. As weve seen time and again, theres no pipeline thats completely secure. Billions of dollars (in some cases taxpayer dollars) have been spent on cleaning up messes left behind by oil companies. Leaks and spills have ravaged communities and their water supply in the wake of these spills.CALL TO ACTION: It is time to stop looking to oil and fracking companies to solve our energy problems. It is time to rethink energy use, respect the earth, and importantly, its time to support the Indigenous people who have relatives in the ground where this pipeline is to be built. It is time to respect Native holy sites which are now being destroyed by big corporations which seem to care more about money than respect for our earth and the generations to follow.We have been working with a group of people within the Sicangu Camp (a camp within Sacred Stone) who have dedicated their lives to this encampment until the day this pipeline is stopped. They plan to stay no matter how cold it gets and no matter how much money they lose from their day jobs - its that important. We reached out to our friends at the front line and asked them what would help them the most as they brave the winter. Tents and warmth were their first concern, so now weve organizing, researched the best possible wind and weatherproof systems, and figured out how to get it to Standing Rock. THE ACTION: Our goal is to raise funds to purchase ten large wind and weatherproof tents, woodstoves to be used inside the tents, firewood, and hand cranked laundry machines for the encampment. With these weatherproof tents and woodstoves, peaceful protectors will have a space to gather, sleep, eat and keep warm during the frigid cold North Dakota winter. (Check out the video to see how durable these tents really are!) Keeping clothing clean is difficult as winter approaches. Having a hand-cranked washing machine wringer will help those who are camping stay clean. This will be funded last, as warmth is the priority.THE PLAN:A tent, wood stove and piping can be purchased for $1549/unit. Every time we hit this threshold of $1549, we will send a tent and woodstove out to our friends at theencampment. The tent/stoves will be purchased from Cabelas in Rapid City. Each time we deliver two tent/stove units, well raise another $600to send a load of wood. Once we are able to supply the camp with the warmth of tents, stoves and wood, we'll send the washing units. Cost breakdown: Tent/Stove Package 12 x 20 wall tent with woodstove = $1,549/unit including tax.10 tents including stoves units = $15,490(includes tax).Firewood delivery$600 per load (load = 1 ton trailer 16ft long stacked 5ft high)5 loads x $600 = 3,000Wash stationsIncludes clothes wringer, 1 gallon bucket for hot water, 5 gallon cold water container/rinse station = $282/unit including tax2 washing units = $564 (includes tax)Delivery chargesFREESubtotal: $ 19,054Go Fund Me 8% site cost: $ 1,525Grand total: $ 20,579If you feel compelled to stand with those on the front line, but cannot be there in person, please donate and know that youre supporting the movement. If you cannot donate at this time, please share this page and lets get help to those standing at Standing Rock.Once we have tents on the ground, we will send updates with photos so you know they've arrived and you can see your donation in action. Please help us spread the word. Every little bit helps. Thank you for your support!For transparency purposes, the tents are being purchased by Joyce McPherson and funds will go to her for the purchase of the tent/stove/washing units and she will pay the person delivering wood. We are then having members from theSicangu Camp pick-up the tents/stoves/washing unitsat the Rapid City Cabela's (closest store possible) and deliver them to camp. We are happy to provide receipts for all transactions. If there's any funding above and beyond our goal, it will go toward more tents - or what ever is the most practical for the campers on the ground. Please email us if you would like to see receipts or with any other questions.\"),\n",

       "  'Sandra Bland affectionately referred to as Sandy by many who knew and loved her was a vibrant, outspoken and intelligent 28-year-old young woman. She entered this world with a mission and purpose; and from that day forth she made a tremendous impression on others with a trailblazing spirit of activism, advocacy, and an uncompromising passion for equality until she departed this world. A 2009 Prairie View A&M alum, Sandy had recently returned to Texas to begin a new employment opportunity with her alma mater. On Friday, July 10, 2015, Sandy was pulled over by a Texas State Trooper for failure to signal before changing lanes. The traffic stop escalated to an unlawful arrest at the Waller County Jail. On Monday, July 13, 2015, Sandy was found dead in her jail cell. The circumstances surrounding her death are at best unclear and given the information shared by Waller County officials to date, is very disturbing. Sandy was a precious daughter, cherished sister, niece, cousin, Soror and dear friend. Laid to rest peacefully on Saturday, July 25, 2015, she will be grieved for immensely by all those who had the pleasure of understanding the blossoming of a young woman discovering her voice which resonated with those who truly relished in the moments to listen to her speak her truth, a truth anchored in God and love.Sandras untimely death has garnered national attention and reignited social awareness regarding racial disparities within community policing specifically amongst African American citizens. Now that she has been laid to rest, the real battle begins as we seek to understand #whathappenedtoSandraBland while she was in police custody for 72 hours. Although the family continues to grieve, all efforts are being made to seek out the truth. If Sandys story has touched your heart, we ask that you join us as we move forward in pursuing #justiceforSandy. We thank you for your commitment to social justice and for standing in solidarity with our family.Please be aware that this fundraising message is approved by Sandra Blands family on behalf of her mother, Geneva Reed-Veal and her sisters Shante Needham, Sharon Cooper, Shavon Bland and Sierra Cole.#sayhername#sandyspeaks#sandySTILLspeaks#whathappenedtosandrabland#justiceforsandy'),\n",

And over one million in the USA alone. Aphasia affects language - but not his intellect.As many of you know, Chris suffered a massive stroke on Dec. 28, 2012 following ACL knee surgery. His goal prior to surgery was to run his first Ironman race for which he was training. After suffering the stroke he was completely paralized on the right side and had a complete loss of speech. He was determined to gethis strength back after his stroke to run again. He has done several small runs in our local area but is on his way to Iceland to run his first Marathon on Aug. 23, 2014 (just 20 months post stroke).His right side will never be 100% but 90% seems to be good enough for him to run. He still has severe speech problemsand will deal with that for years to come. Chris is not alone to suffer what is called Aphasia and Apraxia among young people. Before he had his stroke we didn't know what those words were. In January of 2013 hecame across ARC (Aphasia Recovery Connection). This is a total volunteer group of people with Aphasia and Apraxia due to strokes or brain injury who are trying to make isolation amongst the sufferers come to an end. The organizations founders aretwo young adults, Christine Huggins and David Dow,who suffered from strokes and with their parents helpthey want to make it easier for young adults to cope with their issues. Many of them had very prominent careers which came to a complete halt as did Chris' career. Chris has turned to them to make many new friends who communicate with him in their own wayto try to make the most of their lives. ARC has no fundingat this time and is working on getting a nonprofit status. It is a social networking site which had about 600 members in January when Chris joined and now hasover 2500 members. Since the organization is only a few years old and it is growing in leaps and bounds they can surely useany donations that you can provide to help support them to make the lives of other people with Aphasia and Apraxia get help in their recovery. Especially at this time when insurances are cutting back on therapeutic treatment, ARC will be there for them.

She has been an outpatient since the age of 5 when she was diagnosed with a rare spinal condition. Each time she went through a procedure or difficult situation, the hospital would provide a prize or reward which kept her spirits up. When she endured a 1:30 minute MRI in Feb of 2014, she noticed that the reward closet was quite empty. Seeing as though the small reward was so important to her throughout her time at Tufts, she has decided to raise money to fill their closets and bring smiles to inpatients and outpatients at the hospital. NOELLE'S STORYNoelle was diagnosed with Dysplastic spondylolisthesis at the age of 5. (Dysplastic spondylolisthesis is a rare congenital spondylolisthesis occurring because of a malformation of the lumbosacral junction resulting in small, incompetent facet joints.) I know that's a lot of medical lingo. Basically, Noelle 4th Lumbar is slipped and twisted over the 5th squeezing the spinal cord. Certain movements or falls could cause paralysis. Noelle was placed in a rigid back brace for 3 years. During those 3 years, she couldn't play outside, participate in physical education, recess or even ride a bike. It was a very difficult time but she remained consistently positive. She found ways to keep herself busy with sewing, piano and reading. Last summer her doctor said that although her condition remained, it had stabilized to a degree where she would be able to do some physical activity and slowly wean from the brace. In October, Noelle began swimming and loved every moment of it. In January, she joined a swim team and recently had her first swim meet! She is slowly regaining strength and muscle and thriving in the pool. Noelle Gregoire in her first rigid back brace at age 5. She wore a brace 24 hours a day for 3 years. In the summer of 2013, she was weaned off the brace. Although her condition remains, she is stable enough to not need it every day.\"),\n",

During Superstorm Sandy, Sean tirelessly coordinated and led the efforts of the Staten Island Detachment in acquiring and distributing relief supplies throughout Staten Island and Brooklyn virtually 24 hours a day. He was always available and always involved making sure the needs of those impacted were addressed and that all we could do to help was done. He did this despite having lost his entire home and almost everything he and his family owned to that very same storm.In the days weeks and months that followed, Sean (retired due to medical disablity), worked to secure a contractor in order to rebuild his home where he had raised his family, while paying rent for temporary lodging after the insurance ran.Ater some time and a great deal of money it became clear that the contractor was not getting the job done and the money was being squandered. Due to the trauma associated with being so harshly displaced from their home and the subsequent troubles with the re-building process, Sean and his family felt it best to move on and start their life fresh in a new home far from the painful memories.In negotiating with their mortgage company, Sean was able to put the remnants of his home on the market for a short sale and identified a motivated buyer, while still making the mortgage payments on the destroyed property as well as his current housing expenses.Shortly afterwards, Sean, his wife and his son all ended up committed to the hospital in rapid succession for a myriad of health issues and procedures, leading to mounting medical bills not all covered by their insurance.While still recovering from their medical issues, the City informed Sean that his old house would have to be torn down and that if he did not do it immediately, they would do so and bill him the costs. This put an end to the short sale and Sean's ability to finally get out from under the crushing and mounting financial burden that circumstances have put upon him.

Ive been going on Burpee Expeditions for the last 8 years through the Burpee Museum of Natural Historyin Rockford Illinois. During a hot day in June of 2011, I found the first bone of a rare, juvenile long-necked Diplodocus dinosaur, that the museum will exhibit when preparation of the bones is complete. I had the privilege of naming this rare dinosaur Jimmy, after my father James W. Mongan. My father suffered from Parkinsons disease for many years, and even had 2 deep brain stimulators put into his brain to help control his movements. I have seen the effects that Parkinsons disease has on a person. He passed away in January 2011. That year started out tough for me in many ways. After my father passed I had a job change and started my own business. If not for winning a free trip to the expedition in Utah at the annual Burpee fundraiser, I would have not gone in 2011. You could say things happen for a reason.I recently learned that the Burpee Museum is in urgent need of financial help for their paleontology program. I would also like to raise money for National Parkinson Foundation because I believe in their mission \"Toimprove the quality of care for people with Parkinsons disease through research, education and outreach\". The funds raised will be split 50/50 between these originations. Funds for Burpee museum will support the staff, students, lab and expeditions so that the scientific and educational work will continue. Why is this so important? Over the last several years, the United States continuously falls behind other developed countries, like Japan, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Canada and France, in the area of science literacy. We need to inspire more children and adults to learn about science. Paleontology is a known gateway science and paleontology related exhibits are a huge attendance draw at natural history museums all over the world. For several years I have been helping Burpee Museum excavate Late Jurassic (150 Million Year Old) dinosaurs from the Hanksville -Burpee Dinosaur Quarry, near Hanksville, Utah. This immense bonebed was discovered in 2008 and was listed by National Geographic as one of the TOP TEN FOSSIL FINDS for that year. The site is massive and preserves skeletons of dozens of dinosaurs that washed up onto sandbars in a large river. Jimmy is a juvenile, long necked dinosaur called a Diplodocus. Burpee expeditons have found approximately 50% complete so far, this dinosaur appears to be only 1/3 grown. When mounted it may be 35-40 feet in length, whereas an adult Diplodocus could reach over 100! This dinosaur could give paleontologists more information on how dinosaurs grew up and what changes they went through. This information can make a contribution to people of my lifetime and beyond. Please help Jimmy to speak up for science, to speak up for everyones ability to discover the wonders of nature, and to speak up for families with a loved one who suffers from Parkinsons disease.The National Parkinson Foundation listened to my story, and wants to be involved in this fundraising goal. When you can make a donation the funds will help in starting to prepare the bones of Jimmy. This will take 2 years to complete. Many staff hours and volunteer hours go into prepping a dinosaur. Estimated costs are $125,000. Imagine what another $125,000 could do for Parkinsons patients care and further research. See links below and follow Burpee Museum to get updates on the ongoing Burpee Expeditions dig of 2015. You may even want to help and join us on an expedition. Yes even you can go on an adventure of a lifetime. Want to just tour the site?

My name is Pablo Carela, I am a Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitor, and instructor inThe South Bronx who is involved in a community project aimed at bringing the beautiful art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to underprivivileged and sometimes marginalized children from different areas of The Bronx at no charge, children who would otherwise never experience such a wonderful and benefiting activity without our time and effort. Our project is very young and still growing; it is funded by our own instructors and some adult practitioners who donate uniforms, spaces, and instruction. It is our dream to send some of our intructorswho need more training and better exposure to high level Jiu-Jitsu instruction on a educational assignment to Brazil, a mission to acquire different techniques and methods of translating BJJ to children. We've contacted educators, trainers and competitors not only in our art/sport but in physical conditioning as well, by whom we will be guided during our stay there on how to be better prepared as coaches and bring back knowledge and skills-sets to empower our community through healthy living. I am one of those instructors, but due to my constricting economic situation I am unable to even thinking of such an endeavor without your help, I would be traveling with my seven year old son and the cost of visas and air-fares for us both is out of my reach and it is imposible for my budget at this moment. I have contacts in Brazil who are also in a nessecitous condition but are more thanwilling to aid me with lodging and food as is the only thing they in their precarious situation can do. I will be most thankful to all those who can contribute to this cause, for this journey would be impossible without your generosity, and hopefully you can also come by to enjoy Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with us and partake in the education of our children and help us in building a better community through athletics and health education.\"),\n",

Things have been incredibly hard in the past 2 years because Jerry was the main provider for the family. Carol started working but Kenny started to get very sick, in and out of the doctors. He had blood drawn on his visit to the doctors & the results came back that he had a white blood cell count of 0. On 10/22 Kenny was rushed to Dartmouth Hitchcock hospital because of having no blood cells, he was there for 8 days. Between many blood cultures taken & a bone marrow biopsy,there were no conclusive results pointing them into the direction of a diagnosis. He was given an anti biotic that seemed to help bring his white cell count up to 500, at which point he wasdischarged to go home. Days went on where Kenny still felt very tired and not himself, doing half days of school and some days he couldn't even get out of bed. He tried to go to school 11/23 but was sent home with a fever which brought him back to the doctors to get blood drawn. Results came back Monday night that his cells were back down to 0, this time he was taken to Boston Children's Hospital. They also took blood cultures and did a bone marrow biopsy, and Wednesday night they broke the news that they had found cancer cells in Kenny's bone barrow. He was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia on 11/25/15. This was such a shock and the doctors told him that he would be starting chemo that Friday in forms of steroids, shots & IV. He will be in Boston Children's Hospital for a month to be monitored but his chemo treatment will be 2 years long. However, when he is released he will still have to come back & forth to Boston very frequently for treatment. As you can imagine this is a huge financial burden on a family that was already struggling trying to recover from the passing of Jerry only two years ago.Carol has been in Boston staying with Kenny which means she's not able to work right now.

       "  \"Alright friends (and strangers) I wanna try something out here. First of all, this post is relatively long in this world of tweets and texts. It will probably take you a whole 4-5 minutes to read, which is pretty much an eternity in today's fast paced world, but I beg of you to please continue on. Please give me 5 minutes of your time. Please and thank you.For starters, if you were tagged in a post that brought you here, congratulations! You should feel honored. It means the friend that tagged you, believes you're an amazing person! They believe you are compassionate, caring and willing to help others in need. Most importantly, they believe in YOU! This weekend at work I met a young girl named Bree from Greenville, South Carolina. Bree is the sweetest little soft spoken young lady you'll ever meet. She loves her friends, her family and she loves to dance. Bree is currently fighting an extremely rare disease called cystinosis. Only an estimated 500 people in the U.S. currently have this disease and only roughly 2,000 in the entire world. Due to it's rarity, funding and awareness for Cystinosis is very limited. The life expectancy of those diagnosed with this disease is only 30 years. The good news is five years ago the life expectancy was even younger; so who knows, with more significant scientific break throughs, public funding, and a little bit of hope, maybe that age will climb higher and higher in the years to come.Now a little bit about me. Last Friday I celebrated my 33rd birthday.I was fortunate enough to enjoy a few days off with my lovely girlfriend down in New Orleans celebrating. We had an awesome time. On top of that, I was so grateful for all the well wishes I received from many friends and family members alike here on Facebook. It was such a kind reminder of all the great people I have in my life. I met Bree the following day and maybe it was the timing of it all, but it really hit me hard: It must not only be frightening for her, but I can't even begin to imagine how she goes about her day to day life. It must be difficult to simply 'have fun' knowing her time here will most likely be cut short due to this awful disease. It saddened me deeply. I thought about how fortunate I am, how fortunate the majority of us are, to have had such blessed and carefree childhoods. Adversely, the day to day struggles that Bree bravely battles are nearly incomprehensible to say the least.No child should ever have to deal with these kinds of worries. No child should have to grow up that quick. Bree should be able to just 'be a kid.' Just be a kid and 'have fun.' SO HERE'S MY IDEA:We've all seen the incredible powers of the Internet and crowd funding. We've seen memes, videos and simple comments spread like wildfire. The potential is limitless. And that's where YOU come in!1. Go donate ANYTHING to the gofundme campaign in the link provided. 5, 10, 20 measly bucks. I'd be willing to bet a couple days from now you won't even notice it's gone. 2. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!!! Once you're done with step one, share this post to your Facebook wall and nominate 5 friends to donate and nominate 5 friends of their own as well.*BE SMART ABOUT WHO YOU NOMINATE/TAG! The first criteria is obvious: you want to tag someone YOU ARE CERTAIN will follow through. On top of that, be sure to pick some friends from different groups, areas, etc. so we can reach the largest audience possible.That's it!  $5 and 5 minutes of your time.$5 and 5 minutes seems like a very small price to pay to help a child out who has already been through more than any of us can possibly fathom.$5 and 5 minutes to have a profound and positive impact on a young child's wellbeing and happiness.$5 and 5 minutes to 'help Bree have fun.'Obviously money alone can't buy happiness, but it can help alleviate the worries of financial burden and provide financial freedom for expenses such as toys, shows, vacations, fun events and joyous experiences. That's where your donations will go. Who knows, maybe Bree will even want to donate to research or other things or people she finds as important as we find her. It's that easy guys. These small donations, COLLECTIVELY, will go a long way.Once this snowball gets rolling, there's no telling how large it will become. Wouldn't that be cool to be a part of it? Wouldn't that make you feel good?Thank you all so, so much and I'm excited to see how this pans out. Please message me if you need further details, have questions or ideas. Know that YOU are appreciated, and know that YOU are making a difference.Thank you again,With love, happiness and hope,Andy\"),\n",

Meet Alan.A Syrian Kurdish boy from Qamishli, Alan arrived in Clarkston, GA nearly a year ago with his mother, father and two sisters. Alans cerebral palsy occurred during birth. It severely affects his motor skills, balance, and speech. Before the war, he had been doing better, his father said. But once the fighting reached Qamishli, he was cut off from the physical therapy that can keep his muscles strong and his joints flexible. Over time, Alan lost the ability to walk and to speak and to chew food. His most functional muscles appear to be those he uses to smile, which he does often. He hams it up for the camera, and he grins mischievously at any mention of his penchant for playing sick to get out of school.  Clarkston is a wonderfully diverse community, and Alan and his family are deeply grateful for the warm welcome theyve received. Still, it's no walk in the park. They live in a complex behind the jail, several miles from the nearest grocery store, without a car. To get Alan to his physical therapy sessions, they rely on good Samaritans, or they take the bus  two, in fact, for two hours each way.

Some people label me asdriven, consistent, or a model of perserverance, but to meI'm just a humble servant everyday to the city of Nashville. My journey started almost 6years ago (March 2011) inside my mother's kitchen. Of courseI had some down falls, but I never let thatmake me quit. Believing in myself gave people motivation throughout the city, and I started to recieve a lot of attention from my hard work and dedication. Mostof my friends and family told me to go for my dream, so I stepped out on faith not knowing it could be a long and tiring journey. I realize I havea few reasons I work so hard. The energy that drives my vision comes from the thought of my daughter's future, and the continuedsmiles I see on my costumer's faces everyday. I love what I do and I will continue to work hard to get where I need to be. It's been over 3 years and my clientel has increased to heights I didn't think I would see at this point, soI want to give a special thanks to all of my customers over the past few years. My customers give me motivation everyday and without themthere wouldn't be Rocky's Wingz. My vision is to purchase a food truck and or building to service all of Nashville and the surrounding counties. Somepeople continue to tell me they can't get to me because of my work hours/location and that just motivates me to work harder. So I'm asking for a donation to my RWC FUND.

I need your contributions to make this dream a reality.Mission: Through dance, fitness, and community we empower ALL women to believe they are strong, beautiful, and worthy of attention.Vision: The Hip Circle Empowerment Center is a safe space for women of all ages, backgrounds, and economic status. It brings together women from across societal boundaries for shared experiences. Through dance and fitness, women are empowered to joyfully inhabit their bodies. Through personal and professional development, women are empowered to courageously accomplish their goals. Through involvement in the studio community, women are empowered to confidently make their voices heard.Details: I have the expertise and experience to make this growth transition a reality, and the women and girls in our community NEED this center. What I need are financial resources. The first step in the process is to transition over into a nonprofit entity and apply for 501c3 status. This will help us to deliver empowering services to many more women. Thats where you come in  your contributions now will help me cover the legal costs to organize and file. Anything above and beyond our current goal will go towards doing other behind-the-scenes work to make this transition happen.How you can help: Your contribution is NOT tax deductible. Right now, youre putting your trust in me and my dream of transitioning the studio into the Hip Circle Empowerment Center.

I will update everyone who contributes at every step of the process so you can see the work Im doing to bring the Center to life. My timeline is aggressive and I have every intention of being able to open our doors no later than June 1, 2018 (8 years to the day from when I first opened the doors of Hip Circle Studio).Next Steps: I am in the process of gathering together a group of strong women to serve as our initial board of directors and am doing preliminary budgeting and planning alongside the work of keeping Hip Circle Studio open for business.

       "  \"The path to my bodybuilding career started back in October 2007 when I was paralyzed. I wascompeting in a motorcycle track event when something broke on my motorcycle and I lost controlhitting a concrete wall. I sustained 2 broken vertebrae in my neck, 6 broken ribs, and 3 shatteredvertebrae in my lower back. The injuries to my lower are what left me paralyzed from the waist down.From that day forward I battled to get back to a normal way of life. Months in the hospital, rehabs,and life adjustments were all a struggle. I am a very competitive person and never had let anythingstop me in the past, and I was not going to let this accident define the rest of my life. While on bedrest I constantly searched for ways to get back that competitive edge that makes up a large part of mypersonality. I finally came across wheelchair bodybuilding, and was instantly inspired by the guys thatcompeted. It gave me a new outlook and motivated me to get back into the gym and do somethingproductive.Less than a year (2008) after my accident I was back in the gym and began a basis weekly routine.Throughout the next two years this routine expanded, and my training became more disciplinedand intense. In 2011, I finally got on stage at the Texas CTS and performed well there. However, theNational Title was always my goal from day one.With the help from my coach (Steve Ioannou), Team Provo, Greg Peterson (Trainer), and Diamond Gym;my prep was hardcore, and physically/mentally draining. I busted my butt to bring the best package tothe National stage in West Palm Beach, FL. Winning this show and becoming an IFBB Pro Athlete was a4 year goal of mine. I had tried to get to Nationals in 2010 and 2011 but never made it due to injuriesand surgery. Winning this past March made it all the struggles in the resent past worth it. To this daysometimes I still can't believe this dream of mine has become reality.Now it's time to perform on the professional stage. The IFBB Pro Wheelchair Championships are onlyweeks away, and I could not be more driven then I am at this moment. I think I can speak for all thewheelchair athletes by saying we all want this sport to continue to grow. Showtime, October 13th isright around the corner. It's time for all the short and long term goals to be tested. Accomplishingpersonal goals are more important than winning no matter how you look at the big picture. I honestlycan say that I couldn't happier with the progress I have in and out of the sport of bodybuilding.I don't look at this accident as the worst day of my life. It was the start of my life. I've learned so muchsince that tragic day, and now do more to help others than I ever have. I work closely with a non-profit to helpathletes like me, and constantly give to charities. I'm regularly reminding myself that it could have beena lot worse. People harp too much on their short coming instead of finding ways to improve them. Allthe wheelchair athletes are perfect examples of overcoming the odds, and attacking adversity head on.This is what I love about the sport; just doing the unthinkable.I hope others gain the motivation that I have through bodybuilding. If anything becomes of my career inthe sport, I hope that others see that life never stops and to keep pushing towards their goals.I hope this short bio helps to inform you a little about my situation. It would be great to have theopportunity to inform the public about the importance of overcoming a tough situation. I'm lookingforward to hear back you guys in the near future. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions orif you're looking for more info.\"),\n",

I will be representing the state of Nevada at the National pageant, where I will be competing for the title of Miss Collegiate America 2014 in Orlando, FL! Winning my current title has truly been a life-changing experience. I've learned so much about myself and have fell in love with my community through servicing others, so much so, it has become a part of who I am now. I have participated in over 35 appearances and service works throughout my reign, all while juggling a FULL school load of 9-12 classes/semester, an active presence in my Greek community and on-campus events, modeling on the side and of course, family time. God has been so good to me and I've been blessed to be afforded these opportunities. With the support of my community, I know I'll make it on that National stage where I promise to PROUDLY represent the city of Las Vegas and the Silver State. So whether you donate $500, $100, $10, $0.01 or just wish me well, I thank you so much for your incredible support.God Bless!Samoa lo'u atunuu pele, ia faamuamua pea le Atua.

I realized if I didn't care about myself nobody else would either.So with a lot of faith, hardwork, and relentless dedication, I am now a happy, healthy, successful, productive member of society. But I couldn't have done it by myself. I had people that I looked up to and turned to in the fitness industry that taught me how to push through and not give up on myself. I want to be able to have that influence on as many others as possible. October 18th in LA, the WBFF (World of beauty fitness and fashion) will be hosting a fitness model competition with a chance for me to earn my professional status as a fitness competitor. This will give me the ability to share my story and my transformation with thousands around the world. Unfortunately, due to recent circumstances, I am having difficulty funding this competition. My hope with this is to raise enough money to get me onto that stage in October and in the running for my 'pro card'. Any little bit helps. To those of you that have been a positive influence and played a part in my transformation, I owe you everything and could not have done it without you.

Our story began about 2 years ago when Zach and I both stayed on the campus at Rochester College over the summer as student workers. He worked on the housekeeping crew and I worked on the grounds crew. So most of our encounters were in passing and just consisted of passing hello's or small talk about work or weather. As the summer went on we saw each other around more and he bagan to pursue spending time with me. At first I didn't realize that he was trying to date me, I just thought he wanted to be friends; so one day he had to sit me down and tell me what was going on. This led to a couple more months of long walks and talks as Zach patiently waited for me. As a result of all our time outside nature and God have become the things that brought us together and it is where we are most happy. Therefore we are having and outdoor/barn wedding in June. My dream has always been to have a simple county, vintage wedding with family and friends and good food. I have a beautiful dress but I can't give any details aways ;). My bridesmaids are wearing flower print sundresses of their choosing with cowboy boots and the groomsem are wearing khaki's with a white button up and suspenders and cowboy boots. Zach and I are both easy going people and we get by on very little (being two newly graduate college students). We struggle to make it from month to month but God always provides us with what we need. All we want it to be able to make our day special (which to us means being able to pay for the basics without going flat broke ;)). We hope that this day will be simple, with lots of love, laughter, and fun. After the wedding festivities we hope to head up to Mackinac City to do some camping, hiking and site seeing. Like I said before, we love being outdoors!! It is what makes our souls happy and it will be the perfect way for us to start our new life together. In order to make that happen we are asking for your help by supporting us monetarily. Whether you can give us $1 or $100 it will mean the world to us!\"),\n",

       "  '(Portuguese translation in the bottom)Aloha!                 Born in Brazil, we are a young couple lovers and believer of Christ as our only savior. Gustavo Faria de Mello (Londrina / PR) and Juliana Aquino Castro de Mello (Cel. Fabriciano / MG).    We have been living in the Boston area, MA, for many years- Juliana for 13 years, and myself for 8 years. We met at Christ the King Presbyterian Church about 8 years ago, and been married for 6 years living in the presence of the Lord.    We are professionals in the area of functional exercise, sports and nutrition, in which God has opened many doors and has blessed us greatly in the work/business market. However, as Juliana became busy coaching and leading exercise classes while attending college (Exercise Physiology at UMASS Lowell), and myself working in the administrative part and leading two exercise gyms, we found ourselves involved with work and other problems and not placing God as priority in our plans.        Although we thought we had life all figured out, we as a family felt the need to pray and seek God\\'s will for us. We wondered if we were living the Lord\\'s dreams or if we were living only to meet our own personal and individual needs. Then, as a hurricane, He began reveal himself to us.     About eight months ago, God has brought Pastor Silas back into my life (a past leader of the King\\'s Kids - Kairos Group of King of the Central Presbyterian Church of Londrina /PR where I was part of a project that preached the gospel and redemption on the streets for about 5 years of my teen years). Therefore, Pr. Silas with his godly graciousness introduced to us a new opportunity to once again serve God through the Ministry YWAM (Youth with a Mission) and God has placed in our hearts the desire to make time for Him.     We sold everything we had and went on this path to serve and seek Jesus and His desires for our lives.Not knowing what he had planned for us, we had obeyed his calling with open heart and mind to hear His voice, and therefore signed up to volunteer at the University of the Nations, YWAM base in Kailua-Kona, HI as Mission Builders.    The plan to provide volunteering service for a month turned into three months. We worked with construction, maintenance and cleaning at the base. Then, throughout that time God was tremendous, surprising us with His plans and callings! Which were confirmed by other brothers and leaders who were also praying for us.     Now we know that God is calling us to reach and transform lives. This time in a different way, not only the physical, but taking the good news to unreached people. We are sure that sport and fitness is one of the ways we can reach out and transform lives; we can take the word of God beyond borders and change the future of nations.     We know we should first study and be transformed by His power. This study is the DTS (Discipleship Training School), which will make us spiritually mature and gain experiences that will make us stronger and completely focused on fulfilling His purpose.     The DTS course were enrolled, will begin on September 25, this course is called: Trailblazers DTS which means \"opening paths\", focusing on the 10/40 Christian window of world where most people live in darkness and are seeking the true light of God.     For this dream and vision of God to be accomplished, we need support of all brothers, sisters and friends whom we know and do not know yet.     We need the spiritual support in prayers of our family and friends, to keep us strong in faith. We also need financial support for our tuition and expenses at school and in our lives.     Therefore, we count on the support of everyone in this new journey we are about to begin.   We are sincerely grateful for you attention in reading about our lives and what God has been moving on us!

Mas, com a Juliana dando muitas aulas e cursando a faculdade de Fisioterapia (UMASS Lowell), eu trabalhando na parte administrativa e dando aulas em duas academias, nos encontramos envolvidos com trabalho e outros problemas e no estavamos colocando Deus em primeiro plano na nossa vida. Mesmo com a vida estabilizada em Boston, sentimos como famlia a necessidade de orar e buscar a vontade de Deus para ns. Queramos saber se estvamos vivendo na vontade do Senhor ou somente vivendo por nossas vontades, e Ele comecou a se revelar a ns.Acerca de 6 meses atrs, Deus colocou a vida do Pastor Silas (ele foi um dos lideres do Kings Kids - Grupo Kairs do Rei da Igreja Presbiteriana Central de Londrina/PR) onde fiz parte no projeto de envangelizaco e resgate de vidas durante 5 anos da minha adolescncia). Com ele veio a oportunidade de mais uma vez servir a Deus atravs do Ministrio JOCUM (Jovens com uma misso) e Deus colocou em nossos coraces a vontade de semparar um tempo para Ele. Vendemos tudo e decidimos servir e buscar em Deus o projeto Dele para ns. No sabendo o que Ele havia planejado para ns, obedecemos com corao e a mente aberta para ouvir a Sua voz  nos inscrevemos no programa chamado: Mission Builders na Universidade das Naes, base da JOCUM em Kailua-Kona/Hava. O plano de prestar servio voluntrio por um ms, se transformou em trs meses.

I have also discovered a huge need which God has placed on my heart. Many of the children here in Uganda, because of the social norms live as cast offs and have no home or family that will claim them. I have spent many months praying, planning, and getting to the point I am at today. I know without a doubt that I am where God wants me to be and doing what He wants me to do. That is to help these children to realize the dream of a loving family and a future with hope. It has not been an easy road and I know there will be bumps along the way, but I have a passionate desire to see this vision come true. Would you be willing to join me and the children's home I am opening Forever Hope Ministries. I know that God has called me to be here, but I also know I cannot do this without financial support from others with a heart for children. I am asking people to commit to just giving $10 (or any amount you desire) a month from January 2015 to January 2016. This might seem like a small amount but it can make a HUGE difference in the life of a child here in Uganda. God has already placed two orphaned siblings in my life. In their young lives they have lost both of their parents, been kicked out of relatives homes forced to survive on the streets, and faced many things no child should have to face. They will be the first to come and live with me at Forever Hope Ministries, I know there will be more in the near furture. However, this cannot happen without the financial support from others.

If you had told me a few years ago that I would be going to Hillsong College to study Worship Ministry for a year in Sydney, Australia, I would have laughed in your face, and proceeded to tell you just how crazy you are for suggesting such a thing. Thankfully, God knows exactly what He\\'s doing, and what situations to put each of us in to get us to become all that He intended for us to be. He has given me a heart for worship. Over the past year I have felt that He is calling me to pursue this desire with all that I am. In many, MANY ways, He has taken me far outside my comfort zone and is consistently showing me what it looks like to completely live for Him and what it means to let my heavenly Father direct my choices, my steps, and my life. I NEVER would have imagined it would mean going to Hillsong College. I know that He has been preparing me for this and He is providing a way for me to get there. Ephesians 3:20-21 is a great reminder of that: \" Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever! Amen.\"Getting to Hillsong is far outside of what I can do on my own. It is going to cost more than I can make. I need a minimum of $17,000 once everything is all said and done. That includes tuition, student visa fees, airfare, and a years worth of living expenses. I am going to do everything I can to earn as much as I can. I am basically putting 75% of my paychecks into savings for this, as well as everything I earn from cake decorating, house sitting and umpiring. Once I am in Australia I will be able to procure a part time job (the student visa won\\'t allow me to work more than 20 hours a week). By the end of the year I will have $9,000-$10,000 saved. Unfortunately, it is not going to be enough. I could really use your help to raise the remaining $7,000. Every little bit helps! If you can give a large amount that\\'s awesome!

       "  'We are creating this page on behalf of our Father, Frank Romeo-to help support him to return to Vietnam, after almost 45 years!In 1968, at the age of 18, Frank Romeo enlisted in the army, and in 1969, he was deployed to Vietnam. During his tour of duty, Frank was critically wounded. Years after returning, Frank discovered that through creating artwork, writing and lecturing, that he was in fact not only healing from his own experience, but that he was able to touch others by teaching and sharing his message. Frank has dedicated the past 20 years of his life to sharing his personal story while creating educational opportunities to learn about PTSD and the Vietnam experience. It is in the spirit of truth, healing and understanding, that Frank regularly conducts art exhibits and lectures to youth and young adults all over the East Coast.Frank has continued to explore his work in the Vietnam experience and after receiving many accolades-he still felt as if a piece was missing. Our father knew that in order to gain closure and truly heal from HIS Vietnam experience, he must go back. As Frank explains it, his re-visit to Vietnam is a historical, spiritual, and emotional journey. And in the true nature of our dad, it is one that he feels compelled to share with others.In a journey that has never been documented before, Frank is inviting friends, family and youth and young adults from all over world to follow his travels in real time. Frank has created an interactive blog that will coverhis 1968-1970 years in the military as he \"revisits a time and place that sculptured my (his) life.\" (Frank) will travel to \"key locations involved in the war and try to bring a viewpoint only seen through a soldiers eyes\". Followers will be able to track Frank on his journey, and post questions as he visits these places and attempts to bring life, in real time-50 years later, to the Vietnam experience.Frank has continued to lecture and support awareness around the Vietnam experience for many years, and he has always done so on his own dime. We hope that we can show our dad that we appreciate and support his work and bravery in his decision to return to a place in time that has shaped our lives. Anything that is donated to this project will go to travel expenses, room and board and all other costs incurred in this trip.Please help us to support our father to return to Vietnam, and to continue his life\\'s work. Thank you so much,Love, the Romeo children.For more information on Frank Romeo or to follow his journey back to Vietnam, please check out his blog: Gotmysecondwind.blogspot.comFor more info on his work with Vientam Artwork and lectures:Vietnamartwork.comTo see a Channel 12 interveiw clip of my dad: Vimeo.com/96372603\"Frank Romeo is a disabled Vietnam Veteran, a survivor in many ways. He has survived physically from the pain and trauma of being critically wounded at 18. He has survived emotionally from the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that has plagued him for over 30 years. And he has survived spiritually through painting, public speaking, and writing.\" (J'),\n",

       "  \"******Success! Thank yoy everyone who contributed. I reached Santiago 90 days ago and I couldn't be happier about my choice to take the journey. *****Family and Friends,Welcome to my site! I invite you to come with me on my walk of the Camino.What is the Camino? TheCamino de Santiago(also known as The Way of St James or The Road to Santiago),is the name of any of thepilgrimageroutes(most commonly theCamino Francsor French route)to the shrine of theapostleSt. James the Greatin theCathedral of Santiago de CompostelainGaliciain northwesternSpain. Tradition has it that the remains of the saint are buried there. The Camino is a spiritual journey that pilgrims of all faiths and backgrounds have traversed for over a thousand years.Why do I want to walk? At this point in my life journey, I am happy with how I have grown and with what I have achieved. Moreover, life is not stagnant; I yearn for something more. After being introduced to information about the pilgrimage and after considerable research, I am confident that this is the next call on my life. It is my hope that through this pilgrimage, I will experience exponentially greater personal and spiritual growth. I am excited for the adventure to begin!What do I plan to do? The journey is 500 miles, beginning at St. Jean Pied de Port, France (near Biattitz) to Cathedral Plaza in Santiago de Compostela, where I will attend Mass atnoon. I have booked a flight and will be traveling April 29 into Bilbao, Spain June 10 out of Porto, Portugal. I plan to walk 7-12 miles each day, stopping at hostels along the way. I have 44 travel days but plan on stopping in major cities like Leon and Burgos.  Meals will be eaten nightly at the hostels and other meals purchases along the way at local grocery stores and bakeries. I will only carry a backpack and wear a fanny pack, which will carry everything I need. The backpack will weigh about 20 lbs plus a liter of water.How you can help! Most importantly, I need your prayers. This will be a physically, emotionally, spiritually challenging endeavor and I cannot do it alone. I will need your prayers: prayers for health, safety and protection, smooth travel, good weather and for God to grow me.How this GoFundMe helps!With your gracious and generous donation of the cost of one day on the Camino(40 euros= $40.... The exchange rate is very low), I will dedicate a day of the Camino to you: waking up and offering the day for you; praying for your intentions and well-being all day long; and sending you a postcard from that day's starting/stopping point(post-office permitting).Beginning to end, you will spend that day with me! If you have a family member or friend that needs prayer, a day can be dedicated to them too. Feel free to donate the cost of additional days! And no gift is too small! For those who donate under $40, I will combine to make up one day and pray for the combined group.Funding Details:Anticipated costs of thetrip:\\n - Roundtrip flight to and from St. Louis, MO to Bilboa, Spain/ Porto, Portugal to St. Louis, MO was $1100 (This was purchased with my 2014 tax return)\\n - One day on the Camino(40 euros= about $40) x 44 days = $1760-Gear: Although I have some outdoor equipment and gear that can be used for this trip A lot of special gear and will need to be purchased. Items that have been or will be purchased: Trekking poles, boots, hiking sandals, rain gear, 33 liter backpack, along with some other smaller items = $1100Estimated Total Cost: $3960minus plane ticket = $2860minus $1100 in gear spent = $1760minus $839 in savings = $921minus $490 in GoFundMe = $431I STILL NEED $431 TO MAKE THIS TRIP POSSIBLE!!! I'm currently saving every penny I can and valeting extra hours to come up with the extra dollars.Thank you in advance for your prayers, support, and donations while I prepare for the trip of a lifetime! I will be creating a blog spot shortly so that daily postings can be followed by those who care to join me! Beun Camino!(Greeting said between Pilgrims on the Camino)Morgan RuppelPS: All monetary Christmas, Valentines day, and Birthday gifts have went towards my trip to SPAIN!

I've always been interested in the way that these systems work on the local, national and global level... and recently came across an opportunity for a once-in-a-lifetime international experience that would greatly help me connect to the Diaspora, challenge oppressive policies, and show solidarity with a resilient group of people.

       "  'Hello friends and family! There are many people in the world who put their heart, soul and passion into making a difference for others. Teachers do this every day. Sometimes those on the receiving end of these difference-making contributions \"get it\" -- they see what a difference someone has made for them. And they acknowledge it.My teacher friends and I often talk about how the best \"gifts\" we\\'ve ever received have been the cards, emails,andletters from our former students when they\\'ve been out in the world for a while and, looking back, they see the impact we havemade in their lives.We also lament, however, that so many teens/young people take these contributions for granted. They don\\'t always appreciate what others have done for them, and if they do \"get it\", they don\\'t realize how powerful it is for them to just say so.When you acknowlege someone, it is a gift of love for the recipient. When the recipient accepts your acknowledgement, it is a gift foryou.My project honors the incredible acknowlegement that I received from Mayank Bhandari, one of my former students. Through his ongoing appreciation for the difference I made in his life, he shows others what lengths committed teachers go to to make a difference for their students. Will you help me honor Mayank -- and accept his beautiful acknowlegement --by contributing to the cost of attending his wedding in India? Here\\'s the story....Ten years ago, I met Mayank Bhandari, a young student in my Academy of Finance program and a member of our DECA chapter. From the start, I could tell that Mayank was one of those driven teens I just knew would achieve great things. In fact, in his junior year of high school, Mayank and his friend Taj created a business plan that won first place at International DECA Competition in LA. I even arranged for them to practice their presentation for my college friend Jeff, who was a big-shot marketer at Sony Pictures at the time (I scored major cool points for that! Thanks, Jeff!) Mayank asked me to write his college recommendation letters the next year which, Id like to think, helped him get accepted to UCLA. In his senior year at UCLA, Mayank used me as a reference when he was applying for an internship with an investment banking firm, and I was an enthusiastic advocate on his behalf (they simply could NOT refuse to hire him!) He worked for Deutsche Bank for the past few years until he recently left to start his own company.The Proposal: One day last fall, Mayank called me from his office in Los Angeles to say he would be returning to Coral Springs for a brief visit and he wanted to enlist my help with a very special plan. He was ready to propose marriage to the woman of his dreams, his long-time girlfriend, Jasmin Beveja, who would soon graduate from USC Law School. And, he said that he was actually calling to ask my permission to use my high school classroom, full of students, as he had once been, as the setting for his proposal! I was so honored! Of all the places he could have chosen! Needless to say, the entire experience was delightful for me, for my students who got to witness the event (imagine the frenzy of smart phone photos!), and no doubt for Jasmin, too! (She said Yes!).The Invitation: Recently, I received a call from Mayank to invite me to his wedding in India! What an honor! And what an exciting possibility this invitation presents for me and Julian! Of course this would not be just any wedding trip! There would have to be visasand shots, flights to the other side of the world, deserts to cross and a castle to enter (Click here to see the castle where the wedding will take place!)And, of course, we would have to prepare to be guests at this traditional Indian wedding, which promises two entire days of splendor, ceremony and celebration, dazzling colors, dancing, food, friends and family!The Opportunity: Needless to say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime, and one that begs us to say YES! Yet on my salary as a teacher the cost is a bit daunting. Mayank and his bride have generously offered to provide our hotel accommodations at the wedding site, so we just need help with the airfare to/from and within India. Can you contribute? We promise to share our journey through Facebook, with photos and stories!Thank you!'),\n",

There's not an unkind bone in the dude's body, and I can think of a dozen people who deserve it more, myself included. I'm going to take him to Comicon in Phoenix on the first weekend of June 2014. I'm not a rich dude, just a single dad who's trying to repay a friend for all the generosity he and his family showed me through the years I've known them.When I was a much younger man, I was homeless for the better part of a year. Louis's family let me sleep in a 5th wheel on their property instead of having to sleep in my car. I was able to shower there, have meals there, they even had me over for holiday dinners at a time when my own family wasn't around. They're the raddest family I know, and I wish I could even come close to repaying everything I owe them (Although I'm thinking I'm going to find a weekend to drive down and trim the mistletoe in their yard like I said I would. In 2004. I'm a little bit of a procrastinator).I want to give Louis an awesome vacation, as stress free as I can make it. No worrying about meals, hotels, photo fees, anything. Just go to Phoenix, have fun, hang out, see old friends, do wheelchair racing, get in trouble, and possibly stalk Nathan Fillon (Okay, that one's mostly for me. I liked Firefly). I've already shelled out for part of the hotel and tickets, and some close friends have also contributed, but I'm well short of what I need to make this amazing.I'm shooting for $750 to help cover hotel costs, food costs, gas costs for transportation, as well as costs of getting around and viewing different events inside Comicon. If I exceed that goal, that would be absolutely fantastic - every unspent dime will be donated to a charity of Louis's family's choice, or to Louis's family to cover medical expenses.Louis is my dude, man, one of the oldest. Cancer sucks, and he doesn't deserve to deal with that kind of illness.\"),\n",

Every time we choose to show kindness every time we choose to love we are changing the world for ourselves and others. I am attempting moment by moment to be the change I desire to see in our world. I fear that if I do not change my world  if I do not act  change will not come.There are so many problems in the world. I am human just like you, and I have hurt and been hurt. I have chosen selfishness and greed and been affected by others who have done the same. I have watched pain and unkindness damage individuals and groups and nations and the world. What is the solution to these problems? How can we make things better? Today I choose to be a solution  to construct kindness and create love. Kindness is simple. In a world that seems to be full of the complex and unprovable, why not be simply kind all of the time? Why not flip the script everywhere in an attempt to flip the script of the future of our world. With kindness you need nothing but you. Together, WEare enough. For some examples of the tidal wave of change we have been generating through kindness, and that we need your help to continue, see these pages on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/joshcrowd https://www.facebook.com/youareamazingandsoamiYou can also take a look at the videos on this page which highlight a day in the life of a kindness journey.The next phase of my kindness journey begins April 1. I need your help to keep the journey going. As of April 1st I have no vehicle, housing, or food. All I have is my desire to spread kindness around the US as I travel and interact with others. I also have another human being joining this kindness journey. Bishoy heard about this movement online and saved his own money to come to America to help. He will be flying into Los Angeles the first week of April, and plans to spend the next three months by my side as we offer our lives as kindness to the world. Can you help? If you do, I cannot offer perfection but I will promise to do my best to use each dollar efficiently to pour kindness, love, and hope to our world through action. I will ask myself, if I were in the shoes of those who gave, or in the shoes of those I am interacting with, how would I want to be treated? I will then show love with kindness in every way I can. For those who give to the cause, know that my greatest form of accountability is transparency. I will keep you updated on the acts of kindness you are helping to fund. As I will be traveling without a stable address, my sister Melody Crowder-Meyer will handle all donations received and will disperse them on a need by need basis to cover basic survival needs as we continue to offer our lives as kindness.I hope youll consider helping me continue my kindness journey. And I hope, even if you cannot contribute financially, that you will contribute to this change by showing kindness to those around you always. Find ways to make a difference. And, if you can, please help me make a difference too!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery moment of every day we change history, the question is how - for better or for worse? Today I will choose to be the difference I desire to see in our world. We love and thank you world for being you. Kindness, Love, Peace and Respect to you,You are Amazing and so am I!

This year an amazing opportunity knocked on my door when I was invited to travel with the People to People student ambassador program all the way across the globe, to the fascinatingly beautiful Australia. As this incredible adventure is an all-inclusive 20 day trip full of once in a lifetime experiences, it is not inexpensive.I do believe however that I am capable of fundraising the $7,000 tuition just like many other People to People student ambassadors do each year. To reach this ambitious goal, I'm asking for your help in the form of donations and spreading the word. Any and all donations will be a priceless step towards making my dreams a reality.

Well so is my father but because of our work and schedules we have hunted very little together. He is retired Army of 20 years and has been working DOD And you all know I'm a drifter and work everywhere. Well it just so happens I have a guided SnowGoose hunt coming up this February 13th 14th and 15th. I can count the number of times my dad and I have waterfowl hunted on both of my hands.

My dad is an extremely reserved hunter and has never experienced a hunt like this. The memories that would be made on this hunt would be priceless.

For the people who have know me through my years of playing trio on Sundays at the Bar Next Door, and to the friends on You Tube who have asked about a solo disc, I've aspired to produce this solo project. I find solo playing to be the most demanding and intimate, therfore I will absolutely build on all the hard work and growth the trio session insisted on. I have plenty of new solo arrangements to share and will be eager to do so.With both inspiration and humility, I am continuing to raise funds for the solo project. To record, edit, mix, master, produce artwork and packaging for 2 CDs can easily cost $10K or more! I am happy to have reached an initial goal of over $6K and am aspiring to continue with your ongoing support.The solo session is scheduled for the end of May at Oktaven Audio in Westchester with another editing, mixing and mastering session to follow in the weeks after. Then I will aspire to repeat the post-production work needed to produce hard copies for CD 2/the solo CD (vs. releasing solely a digital download).With the help of my friends, colleagues and music lovers, I would be thrilled to see the 2 CDs recorded, mixed, mastered and printed as hard copies!Notice again, the incentives below, that I've created to inspire your support!My deepest thanks again for helping me move towards my goal!All the best!Peter\"),\n",

We spent 30 days living in the space and renovating on a shoe string budget. Weopened with ten bottles on the shelf and $1,000 in the bankbutquickly became a neighborhood favorite. We expanded in just one year to the neighboring space adding a special events centerand full restaurant.  The operating cost were a little more than we calculated and while we trippled our gross sales in just one year, we were hit hard by the slow Austin summer months.  We are located in the best spot in Austin surrounded by over a dozen hotels and the Austin convention center. Business will pick back up in September and we will see a net income by December if we can just make it through the next few months.Unfortunately we are in danger of having to shut down due to a lack of operating capital. We must raise $25,000 of the requested funds by July 31st or be evicted by our landlord.My prayer is that someone will step forward and help uskeep this dream alive as we fight to save The Brass House.

Heart of Art's Gallery is a safe space that nurtures a community who embraces the femininity and loving nature that gives these beautiful souls a voice and healing through art, workshops, and performances.On the evening of August 29th the Gallery was attacked. Two men from the surrounding neighborhood who had just harassed some of the attendees became aggressive and violent towards the crowd as well as the establishment. Bell and Kenia, founders and owners of HOA, ushered all guests inside and barricaded the doors with no hesitation. The police were called however during that wait for them to get here, we felt the walls shaking as they kicked the doors and destroyed the art outside.This incident was the last of present attacks on the space over the past several years and it has forced HOA to finally make the tough decision to close down and relocate.Bell and Kenia originally opened because a space such as this was needed; something that focused on empowering women, youth, and the LGBTQ community. Bell and Kenia wanted to reach out to people and let them know no matter what they are going through that there was a community of people who support them and support the fact that it is okay to be different.Through years of renting spaces to create awareness events for topics and issues that no one would talk about, such as femicide in Juarez Mexico and it became harder and harder for them to afford daily rentals, but their passions to create a space where women are the majority and their voices are heard drove them to create Heart of Art Gallery.It is of utmost importance that the idea behind Heart of Art has a home everybody is welcome and safe in and is why we have decided to start a Gofund Me; to get our next vision in motion and create a new space for the community. With the funds currently raised, Bell and Kenia have been able to move the entire contents and art from all the lovely contributors they have met over the years, but their work is not done yet and they are working hard to keep Heart of Art beating through these tough, dividing times.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.The Heart of Art family.heartofrtgalleryla.com\"),\n",

My name is Julia Marchese and I am a filmmaker currently living in LA.I recently completed my first film, a documentary feature called Out of Print, about the importance of independent cinemas & 35mm to culture. In the film I focused on The New Beverly Cinema in LA, my former employer, as well as The Prince Charles Cinema in London as twoexemplificationsof how special and different every cinema is and how each one cultivates their own unique, quirky community.Spreading awareness of how essential independent cinemas are is my life's work, and I am ready to begin my next chapter.Out of Print was just chosen as one of the carefully selected titles included in Scalarama , an annual celebration of film each September in the UK inwhich a network of cinemas band together to share a touring program.I am so honored to have Out of Print play 5 dates during Scalarama - premiering at the Prince Charles! - and the theaters that are playing the film would love for me to tour with it, but the funds aren'tthere on their side or mine.

Historically, it will be a time capsule of specific time and specific place, and will continue to spread awareness of what makes each cinema significant and precious.I will be bringing equipment with me and will record at as many cinemas in the UK as I can above the five at which Out of Print is playing during Scalarama.Specific travel dates and budget breakdown are below.

       "  'It all began with a handshake. After winning several major awards at a university film festival, director and writer Mary-Madison Baldo turned from her friends to see an arm outstretched, awaiting a formal introduction. She then met the owner of said limb, a fellow director named Alex Bretow, who asked if they could work on a film project in the future. Their hands shook, phone numbers were exchanged, and a partnership was born. For two years, student filmmakers Madison and Alex have established their own independent film company by the name of BaldoBretow Pictures, and have created multiple short films, music videos, commercials, and features for assorted competitions, for business, or just for fun. Balancing school, work, and their company has proven difficult, but no matter what, they have taken on every obstacle and every challenge that the world has presented them and produced award-winning films.     One month ago, they applied for the elite opportunity to go to the Cannes Film Festival in France, where they could meet industry professionals and have their visual work shown on the silver screen in front of a gigantic audience. On March 16th, they were informed that they had both been chosen out of hundreds of applicants. They celebrated a day of extreme joy, but they soon realized that they did not have enough money to get to the festival not without help.      And this is where you come in. The full trip lasts for two weeks in May, from the 11th to the 25th, and Alex and I have done the math, resulting in our final calculation of $11,000. The first major deadline is on March 20th for $2800 dollars, a sum that secures our place in the festival. The second deadline is April 10th for the same amount, which finalizes our positions. The rest of the money is for airplane tickets, transportation within France, food, and hotel rooms. We really cannot accomplish our goal without your aid, and if you contribute to our cause, you will receive thank you notes, prizes, and other goodies for your assistance. As long as I can remember, I have wanted to share my stories with the world, and Alex feels the exact same way. This opportunity is a dream come true, as well as a massive step towards achieving our ultimate goal: to establish our company and market our films on the worlds most famous stage. Along with paying for school, supplies, and room and board, both Alex and I fund our projects out of our own pockets. We are fiercely dedicated to our craft because it makes us feel whole, alive, and effervescently happy. When we go to the Cannes Film Festival, we would meet fellow student filmmakers and high-profile professionals, making serious connections for our future. We will also see our films premiere to thousands of people that we have long admired and respected, which would be a proud and teary moment for the both of us.    We will be forever grateful to you for supporting us and helping us achieve our dream. Please donate what you can, share this link with your friends and family, and spread the word!

       "  'This coming December brings upon a huge obstacle for my 16 year old brother. Born with a heart defect, Nicholas has been monitored his whole life. This past month after his latest testing, his cardiologists have determined that they need to replace the aortic valve in his heart, which means he will be having open heart surgery.\\n\\nNick is a big music lover. As a Junior in high school, Nick currently has a lead role in the High School Musical Sister Act. He is an amazing singer, participating in Chorale, Chamber Singers, & OffBeats, an acapella group that he is currently managing. He has taught himself how to play guitar. and is already working on a few of his own songs. Nick is also a baritone sax player, in both Jazz and Concert Band.\\n\\nNicks dream is to go to trade school to be an Auto Mechanic, and he pushes for that dream everyday. He isnt afraid to get his hands dirty and he almost always has a tool bag on his side and grease marks on his face.\\n\\nPlease help my family with upcoming expenses like doctors bills, co-pays, travel costs, and whatever else might occur. My mom will be taking time off from work to care for him at home after the surgery. Any support will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!Update: Many have been asking about what is going on with Nick Watts, so I will try to give you a little bit more information.Nick was born with what they call \"a mild valvular aortic stenosis with a mild regurgitation\", meaning that his aortic valve is thick and ridgy, and does not close properly. Therefore, he has a back flow of blood, \"regurgitation\", that pumps back into the left side of his heart. Two of his valves fused together or never separated during my pregnancy, so he has a bicuspid valve instead of a normal tricuspid valve.We knew at some point this would need to be fixed, but we didn\\'t expect it to be so soon. Nick has seen 3 different cardiologists since he was 2 weeks old, and at first, they thought he would make it to be 30-35 before anything would need to be done. Unfortunately, that is not the case for Nick. His heart and valves have changed pretty drastically over the last year and it needs to be fixed soon.His aortic valve has gotten much thicker, to the point of needing medication, and the regurgitation has become severe. Because of the regurgitation of the blood that is going back into the left side of his heart, the heart has become very enlarged on the left side. Imagine pouring a quart of milk into a quart sized container - it is the same volume, so it will easily fit. The back flow of blood in Nick\\'s heart is causing 1/2 of that quart to go back into the left side of the heart and then another quart is trying to pump through at the same time. This means that his heart has enlarged because it now needs to hold 1 1/2 quarts instead of the 1 quart, making his heart work harder than normal.Other than being more tired than usual, Nick has been symptom free and has been able to do most activities. The surgeon wants to do the surgery now, while he is young and healthy (besides the heart, of course), and is symptom free at this time. This should make for a quicker recovery time, as we know that kids bounce back much easier than us older people.He is scheduled to go for surgery the first week of December, with the hopes of being able to have the \"Ross\" procedure done. This surgery would mean that Nick would have no restrictions, no blood thinners, and would be able to do things that he has not been able to do for 16 years.There is a possibility that he will need to have a mechanical valve instead, that would require him to be on the blood thinners for the rest of his life, and he will still have the restrictions. We are praying that the Ross will work for him, but will not know until the surgeon gets in there.I will be taking a family medical leave of absence to care for him at home until he is healthy enough to go back to school. He will return a few hours at a time, as he is able, and I will tutor/home school him until he is back full time.We would appreciate all of your thoughts and prayers, thank you! <3Tammy Nick\\'s mom <3We want to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to read this, for sending thoughts and prayers, for donating, or just for sharing. Thank you! <3'),\n",

       "  'Thank you for visiting my GoFundMe. I am a single mom with a pre-teen son. I recently lost a job that provided more than half my income. I also lost access to the space I was permitted to use to teach my music students. I now need to find or create other employment to replace the half of my income that I lost.I have a natural talent (and a lot of education and experience!) for teaching music students. Several of my former students have gone on to careers in music, and my current students range in age from four years old to people in their seventies. I also teach students with disabilities. The more I teach, the more I love it. I am interested in figuring out how each individual student thinks and approaches music. It is fascinating to watch my students learn and grow as musicians. Borrowing space is a risky proposition. If I lose the space, I sometimes lose students who do not want to move to a new venue. If I lose students, I lose much-needed income. I need a predictable place-my home- in which to teach, so that students do not have to adjust to new locations.Because of the expenses associated with being a single mom, I have not been able to afford to convert my living room into the studio I know it\\'s meant to be! The main thing I need, of course, is a piano. \"Free\" pianos, small poorly-made pianos, and older uncared-for pianos will not work for a professional approach. Students need an instrument that has a reliable action and produces the correct tone. I have changed the piano for the third time. This one is it! This is a gently used piano at a store near me. Very gently used! This costs the same as the P-22 I was interested in. The P-22 had a few problems, and when I thought about my beginning students- that type of problem can really put a damper on enthusiasm. I think beginners of any age notice that \"the key doesn\\'t work\" and think it has something to do with them, rather than the piano. I have heard from both young and old that \"I\\'m not doing it right!\" but the real problem is the piano\\'s faulty action. This instrument, a small Baldwin grand, will produce the range of tones a serious student needs to master; it is in excellent condition. I even got down on the floor under the piano to inspect it (don\\'t all potential piano buyers do this?!) :) It is also a piano that I can tune and do small repairs on myself, which will save me money that I can\\'t afford to spend. I have added $500 to the total, because I was told that the piano movers will charge this much. I am trying to find a mover for less, but this is not the sort of piano you can get your friends to strap in the back of a pickup truck! They will need to take the legs off to get it in the door and reassemble it.Please help fund this piano so I can start replacing my lost income. Thank you so much!'),\n",

       "  'On behalf of the community of Pecan Grove, Texas, I have to share the storyabout a citizen in our community - who took the time to help afellow citizen, for no reason other than it was the right thing to do.Please meet my husband.One Act of Random Kindness Can Change the World...\"A couple of weeks ago Officer Petty answered a call about a welfare concern. When he arrived he found a single father trying to take care of his young teenage children. There was nothing wrong with the father, or the kids, other than they just did not have a lot of material goods. Officer Petty found that the father was sleeping on the floor while the kids were sharing one mattress. Officer Petty spent some time talking to the father and learned that he is trying to find a job in this area so that he can get on his feet and off of assistance. Officer Petty decided to help this family out. On his day offhebrought the family an air mattress and a regular mattress from his home gave it to the family. He also bought them new sheets and pillows. He gave the kids an X-box that he no longer used and bought them a TV and an extra controller so they would have something to do while at home. He later learned that the family did not have a working TV and the one he bought for them is the only one they have. Now Officer Petty is working on getting the kids the school supplies that they will need to start the school year with.Officer Petty was not the one who told us about this. We received this information from an anonymous person. When asked about it Officer Petty told us the story. We asked him if he wanted help with the family but so far he has not asked for any. We wanted to share this with all of you. Officer Petty is showing all of us that being a police officer is about caring for the community you serve in and helping people when they need it. We want to commend Officer Petty for his selfless actions and for his commitment to help those in need. Thank you Officer Petty.\" -Richmond (Texas) Police Department Family, friends, and neighbors have asked how they can help. We are working with the family to fulfill specific needs like pots and pans, towels, general houseware items like cleaning soap, etc. If you have any items that you can donate - like furniture, household items, etc, please contact us. Or please consider contributingany amount, large or small. Proceeds will directly benefit the family and purchase any necessities.

Grandma J's was named after Layla's mom, Jude, who along with Layla'sGrandmaBea, taughtLayla how to cook. Itwas always Layla's intention to name herfirst place after her mom. Jude played a huge role in helping Layla realize her dreamof opening her own business. If you ever had the opportunity to sit in Jude's kitchen over a home cooked meal or cup of Swedish coffee, it would be apparent where theideabehind Grandma J'swarm, friendly, made-from-scratch organic comfort food began.  In 2013, Layla lost her mom and best friend to cancer. GrandmaJ's not only remains a tribute toJude but her artwork, grace, warmth and love arefoundin every corner and in every dish.

Thankfully the beautiful dogs they rescused probably chased off the offender and thankfully they didn\\'t get to Lyle, who was asleep alone as John was away. They both feel very fortunate all they lost was material things. (We all are!)They have insurance with a very high deductible. I am starting this gofundme in an effort to offset some of their cost. I posted the story and link to the story below. These two men give back to the community, help others and are just people you want as neighbors and friends. So, if you want to pass up that bottle of wine, pack of smokes, miss a movie, skip that bagel please toss that money it into this fund to help our friends, because I know they would help any one of us without batting an eye. Thanks so much! LindaFrom WNYT:A three letter gay slur sticks out like a sore thumb on the front of a brick Cape Cod in Wynantskill. Lyle Houston woke up to the crudely spray painted wall Thursday morning, then he called his partner, John Mcenerney. \"You would think my initial gut reaction would be like, \\'oh my God, I fear for my life.\\' I kind of feel more sorry for the person that they felt it was necessary to try to destroy somebody\\'s house,\" said Mcenerney. Much of it is illegible, but \\'Jenner\\' is also written on the front of the house. An apparent reference to transgendered woman, Caitlyn Jenner. John doesn\\'t really understand how that would apply to him, since neither men are transgendered. Lyle\\'s Jeep window was broken and so was a window pane in a side door.  Lyle didn\\'t want to go on camera, but he was home at the time of the incident, and said he never heard anything. After seeing the hate speech, he put up shutters over the words to hide them.  \"It\\'s kind of ridiculous that in this day and age we have to see stuff like this happen, but it does, even in Wynantskill,\" said Mcenerney. Neighbors say they\\'re surprised this happened. Lyle and John have no idea who could have done it and why. They say they live a quiet life and don\\'t have any enemies.  \"If the person who did this, he, or she, or they develops a conscience and goes \\'hey, maybe I shouldn\\'t have done that,\\' but I\\'m not holding my breath,\" said Mcenerney.Lyle said there was also an incident Monday night, but his pitbull scared away someone he now thinks was trying to break in.

       "  'The Wells Historical Society has a vision to save a piece of history from the old USC school building and with the help of a building restoration company that would be possible but only with financial help.The goal is to save the two Kasota limestone archways on the east side of the school along with the 1932 and 1953 cornerstones to create a back-to-back arch that would be erected east of the Wells Depot Museum. The building restoration company would remove the necessary brick from around the archways in order to facilitate their disassembly. After the surrounding brick is removed, the stones will be carefully removed from the archways one at a time and have the residual mortar removed. The stone will then be marked and cataloged as they are palletized and wrapped for storage. We are under the gun, as the demolition for the old school is slated to start in mid-June and we need to collect $38,500 in pledges by June 7th. The All or Nothing Campaign is for pledges towards the $38,500. If we dont raise the money we wont be able to salvage the arches, so they would be destroyed and only the cornerstones would be saved. Fundraising for the erection of the archways will be in the near future.Online pledges will be accepted at gofundme.com and click on Save Wells History to make your pledge. If we reach our goal, your pledge would be charged to your credit card. If we dont make our goal, your credit card would not be charged. The Wells Historical Society along with the building restoration company believes in the preservation of these arches. The idea that current and future generations can walk through the arch that their parents and grandparents walked through; to run their hand on the stone that their ancestors may have touched, is a link to the past unlike many memorials built today.'),\n",

       "  'Help keep CEDEJO (Centro de Desarrollo Jocotepec, A.C. ), a non-profit women\\'s clinic that provides reproductive health & family planning services to indigenous and low-income women and girls in Jalisco, Mexico, open for another year. Individual donations are currently CEDEJOs primary source of funding.A minimum of 12,000 US Dollars (~165,000 Pesos) will keep the clinic running for one full year, from January through December 2015. Please read on to find out more about CEDEJOs programs and how you can make a difference.Who started this campaign?I\\'m Sheila from Vermont, USA.  I\\'ve been bicycling around the worldwith my partner since 2011, in large part, to create a life better aligned with my values (in other words, a life of simplicity and one that would allow me to focus my energy on local and global issues that are important to me). I don\\'t have much money to give to organizations whose missions I believe in but I am able to offer my time and skills to help them meet their goals. I am currently traveling through Mexico and I have been volunteering with CEDEJO since early 2013. (Me cycling through Baja, MX.)ABOUT CEDEJOCentro de Desarrollo Jocotepec (CEDEJO), A.C., located in Ajijic, Jalisco, Mexico, has provided care to indigenous and low-income women and families in the area for over 30 years. (CEDEJO\\'s headquarters in Ajijic)Twice a week CEDEJOtravels to Chapala, offering free pap smears, breast examinations, birth control and family planning counseling to the Tepehua community, one of the poorest barrios in Jalisco. (CEDEJO Director Sylvia Flores greeting women lined up to receive services at the Tepehua clinic.)Another two days of the week CEDEJO travels to vulnerable communities around Lake Chapala via their mobile health unit. By travelling directly to low-income communities, CEDEJO is better able to reach women and girls that otherwise would not seek out or be able to afford services. For the rest of the week, CEDEJO\\'s headquarters and clinic in Ajijic accepts clients by appointment. In addition to providing the above services, CEDEJO also leads educational programs and presentations through a variety of community organizations, schools and forums. In 2013-2014 CEDEJO successfully completed an all-volunteer-run pilot project (Mujeres, Poder y Vida  Women, Power and Life ) which provided over 60 sessions of comprehensive womens empowerment workshops to the women and girls of the Tepehua community. LOOKING BACK on 2013-2014In March 2013, in dedication of International Womens Day and after meeting with the Director of CEDEJO, I volunteered to increase CEDEJOs visibility online and update their informational material. As a part of that plan I needed to get updated graphics so I visited their clinic in Tepehua to take photographs of their work. (Director Sylvia Flores meeting with clients)(Director Flores & Volunteer in exam room of clinic.)During that visit I discovered that CEDEJOs future was in jeopardy. The little funding they were receiving from an international civic organization was going to end in only two months due to new changes in organizational funding rules. And although CEDEJO had received various forms of government and international financial support in its past, world-wide political and financial changes of the last decade had resulted in the disappearance of those valuable funding sources. Unless funding was secured, the clinic would be forced to close its doors in September 2013. After seeing the women and girls line up to receive services from the clinic and realizing how valuable CEDEJO was to the local community, I decided to attempt to raise the funds to keep it open for another year. In August 2013 I began a campaign on Go Fund Me with a goal of raising $12,000 USD (~165,000 pesos) in 12 months. Seventeen months later, through the generosity of world-wide donors, we had raised over $13,000 USD (~178,000 pesos) which allowed the clinic to remain open through December 2014.As we enter 2015, I am celebrating CEDEJO\\'s successes of the past year. In addition to raising funds to keep the clinic open for the last year, CEDEJO also realized the following progress:   Anew website, which includes a blog to keep people updated as well as on online donation function    Anew informational pamphlet for CEDEJOs educational programs which replaced their old one from 1986    New and updated photos of CEDEJOs clinics, workshops and programs (& setting up their FLICKR account).    Creation of a CEDEJO Facebook Page     Creation of a CEDEJO Twitter Account     Press coveragewhich helped spread the word about the clinics need for fundingAs a result of CEDEJOs extensive outreach, new connections were made in 2014. For example, CEDEJOs Director and volunteers met with representatives of the CRED Foundation of the UK while they were visiting Mexico in 2014. These meetings led to a partnership with the CRED Foundation which will begin in late 2015. This partnership will potentially facilitate CEDEJOs fundraising efforts.CEDEJO also met with visiting representatives from Horizons, a Canadian based non-profit organization committed to promoting social justice and people-centered development in Central America and Mexico. Horizons and CEDEJO are currently exploring possible partnership opportunities for 2015 and beyond.In addition, CEDEJO spent many months of 2014 meeting with numerous officials and applying for a variety of Mexican government grant programs. CEDEJO hopes these efforts will result in some fruitful outcomes in 2015.However, CEDEJOs CURRENT NEED is CRITICAL Although CEDEJO\\'s volunteers have been working hard to secure more funding from other sources, these efforts have not yet produced any new long-term funding opportunites. CEDEJO is currently being kept open through the generosity of individual donors, like you.WHY DO WE NEED TO KEEP CEDEJOCLINIC OPEN?Cervical and breast cancer are the leading causes of death among women from ages 35 to 60 in Chapala, Jalisco. CEDEJOis working to prevent these diseases, as well as other diseases, from affecting women through early detection and treatment programs.(Exam Rooms in clinic serving Tepehua Community)Because of poverty and/or lack of education and/or failure of government assistance programs, many women cannot afford to see a nurse or doctor for a routine gynecological exam or prenatal care. CEDEJO helps change this paradigm by educating women and girls about their options. CEDEJO also travels TO the communities that need services the most and has been working in the area for over 30 years, so the communities trust, respect and respond to them. (Women often can\\'t travel far and/or cannot leave their children to gain access to services. CEDEJO travels to their communities in order to provide them service.)Jalisco has the highest rates of violence against women in Mexico, with 60% of women having experienced violence by the hands of their partner. CEDEJO offers presentations, workshops and lectures through schools and other organizations in which the following topics are discussed: womens empowerment, domestic violence, gender equality, STDs, prenatal care and childbirth, family planning, risks of teen pregnancy, and hygiene and health.(\"Violence against women does not make you more of a man.\" CEDEJO\\'s workshops help empower women & men in order to stop the cycle of violence.)WHAT THE FUNDS WILL BE USED FORFunds raised will go toward covering the following: **pap kits for 1200-1400 women for one year **lab fees for processing pap tests for one year **transporting pap tests from Chapala/Ajijic to Guadalajara lab 2 times a month, every month, for one year **operating costs to keep clinics open at the very least 4 days a week, every week, for one year (i.e. phone, electric, internet) **transportation costs (via car pool or bus or mobile van) of unpaid nursing staff and/or volunteers to the CEDEJO free clinics, 4 times a week, every week, for one year **replacing or replenishing additional medical supplies needed to perform pap smears (i.e. patient examination gowns, sterilization equipment) **coverage of numerous workshops for youth and women\\'s groups in Ajijic and Chapala (family planning, STDs, women\\'s empowerment)Funds raised above the $12000 needed for the clinic costs for 2015 will go toward expanding CEDEJO\\'s workshops and educational programs and/or toward 2016 expenses.  HOW YOU CAN HELP I hope that others will see the value of CEDEJO\\'s clinicsand the services it offers and that you will find it in your heart to do one or more of the following:GIVE A DONATION.Donate via this campaign page or via CEDEJOs website . Donate what you would normally spend on a co-pay to visit your gynecologist or your doctor. Make a memorial donation in the name of someone you\\'ve lost to breast or cervical cancer. CHALLENGE EACH OTHER.Neighbors, co-workers, business or civic groups, churches or other organizations in the Lake Chapala area or around the world ::Consider donating 14,000 pesos or more (~$1000 US or more) to this fundraising effort and then challenge another organization or group to match your donation.

       "  \"My name is Ben Weidner. I am a Type 1 Diabetic and I am a boy scout with troop 295 in West Deptford, New Jersey. I am currently working towards the highest rank of Eagle Scout and the next step is to complete my Eagle Scout Project. I am working with the Diabetes Center for Children at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. My project is to raise the necessary funds to purchase important supplies to be included in kits for newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetics. This will help them in their time of need. When I was first diagnosed I was scared. I am trying to give back to the community to help others in my same situation. There will be items in the kits that will help diabetics and their families adjust. Some examples of the important items to be included are alcohol pads, glucose tabs, and glucose liquid. I will also look to purchase a quantity of medic-alert tags to supply newly diagnosed kids.I am here as a leader to show other kids that being a diabetic is not a big deal. Children's hospital has a need for hundreds of medic alert tags and supply kits for Type 1 diabetics every year. My goal is to make 150 kits that will be assembled by scouts from troop 295. Scouts and volunteers will help me distribute these kits at the hospital during the Living Well with Diabetes Conference on March 28th, 2015. I will be attending and participating at the conference and will lead volunteers inhelping with a Type 1 Diabetic 'tween' program at the conference.I am asking for donations in order to purchase the supplies needed for these kits. You can donate easily online using this GoFundMe site set up for my Eagle Scout Project.

Today I am turning 26 and I think I finally get it.I grew up in a peaceful community in Aleppo where organizations like the Armenian General Benevolent Union(AGBU) sustained a healthy community life through a vast body of devoted donors and volunteers. Today Syria is in war and AGBU has once again turned to its original charter of 1906providing desperately needed aid to those in need. Since the outbreak of Syria's Civil War, AGBU's Syria Relief Fund has provided a lifeline to thousands of families through the support of donors around the world and the help of over one hundred volunteers from within the country. Most of these volunteers are friends I grew up with, went to school with or served the community with as part of AGBU's scout movement. These brave men and women who stayed back in Syria have been putting their lives in danger every day to make sure aid reaches those who need it most. Dear family and friends, for my 26th birthday I ask you to give me the gift of contributing to the humanitarian work my friends are doing on the ground. Please help me raise $2000 in support of AGBU's Syria Relief Fund.Please visit http://agbu.org/syriarelief/or contact me for further details\"),\n",

       "  \"I am writing this on behalf of Audrey, I am her mom. Five years ago my girl went through some pretty hard times. Her dad moved out and to Missouri with about a week's notice, leaving us with a house being foreclosed on and no income. I had been a stay at home mom up to that point. Audrey's was 8. We lived well below the poverty line and survived because of good family and a 401k I cashed out. I found work and rebuilt our lives, but Audrey went through some very hard and painful times. She stopped growing, she fell behind in school, she spent more time alone and often said she was afraid and missed our old life. She missed her sister in California - someone she had seen fairly often when her dad would fly her to Washington. Audrey found bright spots... playing outside on her rope swing, building up strength by swimming, and naming the chickens we raised to have eggs to sell. Then she discovered Bethany Mota. From the first YouTube video she watched, she was hooked. Here was a teen girl, not much older than herself, who was finding relief from stress and bullying by posting YouTube videos. Bethany became a surrogate sister through those videos. Bethany gave Audrey hope that things get better if you stay positive and keep going. If you focus on the things you love, not the things bringing you down. Audrey has an opportunity to go away to a 7 day camp this summer, in Conneticut, (she's never been to a sleepaway summer camp) where the camp leader is *Bethany Mota*. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet the virtual big sister that helped get her through all the hardest times - including only seeing her dad about 4 times in 5 years. I have rebuilt our lives, but the cost of tuition and airfare is beyond what I can afford on my own. So I'm asking for help to fulfill the biggest wish of my darling girl. She's a strong, kind, resilient kid who has managed to catch up in school (got her first 100% on a math test two weeks ago!), learn to trust people again, and now is brave enough to fly across the country to meet her hero.Any money raised over the amount needed to go to camp will be used to send Audrey to California in June to see her sister whom she hasn't seen in 3 years.\"),\n",

For my senior year at the University of South Florida, I was accepted into the Anthropology Honors Program, which required a thesis component. My thesis research was conducted at Tampas Lowry Park Zoo, where I was an intern in the Primate Department. The abstract reads: \"Research was conducted to assess the publics awareness about orangutans and their endangerment and to educate them about the facts they may be lacking. Participant and systematic observations and short surveys were used to answer an integral question: do the connections made by the public with orangutans in a zoo setting lead to caring more about the species in the wild? The applied efforts of this project were to promote public awareness about orangutans as an endangered species, particularly due to palm oil production, and to inform the public so that they might become more environmentally-friendly consumers.\"After over a years worth of work and research and over 50 pages of writing later, I finished my thesis, titled Orangutan Conservation: A Call for Public Awareness, this May.I recently have been given an amazing opportunity to present a poster version of my thesis at the 2014 Orangutan SSP Husbandry Workshop & Conservation Summit on October 6th at the Houston Zoo! While I would love to participate in the conference, I cannot afford it given my current, unemployed, college graduate statusthis is where my family, friends, and friends of friends come in!

I will only be able to go to the conference IF I raise all of the funds, AND you will only be charged IF and WHEN I reach the goal :) If you choose to donate, while I cant give you much, I will give you my eternal gratitude and Ill be sure to take lots of pictures!Now that Im graduated, with a degree in Anthropology, I am looking for a career in great ape conservation education and public awareness. This opportunity not only would allow me to present my thesis, but it would also let me hear some of the most influential people in orangutan conservation speak and potentially give me the chance to speak with them.

I moved here to the US from the Czech Republic about 16 years ago with only a $100 in my pocket, a backpack and the drive to create my own business one day. Fast forward, I opened abakery about a year ago in a smallBavarian town called Helen which is located in the North Georgia Mountains. With help frommy closest friends, I was able to gather enough money to renovate a small space where I could offerEuropean style sweets including authentic Czech\"kolache\" which reminds me of home. Bohemian Bakery Cafe opened on September 27th, 2014 and my bakery business has been slowly rising since. You can visit to see what customers have to say about us.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/bohemian-bakery-cafe-helenUnfortunately,the building owner\\'s friend, without notice, decided to open a deli next store to me which is a conflict with our (andhis) business because we both offer European style deli sandwiches . They are evictingme and unfortunately there are loop holes that allow him to. He sabatoged my business with threats as well as sending agricultural and health inspectors to mybusiness over the past couple of months. Upon inspection, they saw that I have followed all the guidelines. I am looking to relocate my business but with little notice, I am not prepared to move into another location.After sinking all of my life savings in to starting my bakery, I need help to cover moving expense and to cover the basics to start over. I do not have family here in the US and as a single mom, I don\\'t have a backup income I can rely on. This bakery is the bloodline for my family as well as we have established a great connection with the community.We are asking for your help to raise approximately $15,000 for all the moving expenses, rent deposit, 1st month rent and to cover some of the court fees we have incurred. Anything you can do will help! Even a $1 or $2 or $5 will help! I hate asking for money but I have worked so hard and given up so much to create Bohemian Bakery & Cafe and I would hate to see it fail for reasons out of my control. We have to move out by July 12, 2015and will be temporarily on hold while we search for a new location but we have to secure funds before doing so.We promise to give back to the community when we get the bakery back up and running and will create a wall of thanks for ourgenerous donors.

       "  \"Hi! Thanks for taking the time read this. A little while back, I decided to branch out and try new things to stuff eggrolls with. The normal eggrolls are delicious, to be sure, but why not try other tastes? I ended up experimenting with dessert eggrolls and ended up making apple pie eggrolls as my first experiment. After that first bite, I knew then I couldn't stop. Since then I've come up with lots of flavors - Reubans, Pizza, Mac n Cheese with Bacon for savory eggrolls and Oreo cheesecake, Lemon curd, apple pie, S'mores, cookie dough and strawberry cheesecake for dessert eggrolls.I'm going to start off with 20 flavors at a time, and then come up with other recipes and I'll rotate in new flavors every month. Future goal will to get a food truck or sell them at local markets, but for now the goal is to get the licensing to make these from my home kitchen and ship them out to everyone frozen.To do this, I'll need the funding to get an air fryer for healthier cooking (requires 80% less oil! Imagine how many more eggrolls you can EAT), a separate fridge/freezer to store the ingredients, ingredients to experiment with for new recipes, and of course, to pay for all of the licensing fees. Starting the goal at $5,000 to see if this is feasible, that should cover the cost of experimenation and finalizing the recipes and testing of shipping containers. If there's enough interest, might even shoot for a cart or a truck!Thank you kindly for all of your help and support, and have a most wonderful day!\"),\n",

       "  \"HELP US KEEP OUR DOORS OPENAfter 30 years in IT, I took an early retirement and invested my life savings (over $300,000) to pursue my dream... and I opened my first business, BuffDog Canine Fitness Center in March 2014. I spent six years developing this concept while working my full time IT job AND working part time at a pet store to gain my Dog Training certification and started conducting dog training classes. Now I am at my wits end because I am running out of money and need YOUR help to keep our doors open.HERES HOW THINGS WENTOnce the business plan was complete, I spent 3 months working with a realtor just to find a building that would approve my business concept. After signing the lease in May 2013, I immediately applied for a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) so that I could make the necessary building modifications and open the doors. I hired part time dog trainers, solicited volunteers to help implement the business plan, and have contracted several professionals along the way to assist with every aspect of getting this business off of the ground. All have worked tirelessly to see that no detail was overlookedAND NOW THE RED TAPEThe CUP is required by the city of Santa Ana to authorize a business to have dogs on the premises. Getting the city to sign off on my CUP took 9 months!!! You may wonder why it took so long. Well, one of the conditions the city imposed on my CUP was for ME to pave the city street in front of the building. Yes, truly! I was mortified. The funny thing is I attempted to find contractors/companies to fill the request. Here's the rub - no private contractors would pave city streets and no company that provided work on city projects would work with a private citizen. It took me additional months to get the city to waive that requirement! I was, however, REQUIRED to install $11,000 worth of lights on top of the building (which I do not own) to satisfy another requirement to get my CUP approved. AND FINALLY after 11 months of paying rent on a building that was generating no revenue, I was finally able to open my doors in March 2014. PLEASE HELP IF YOU CANSo here I am today It has been my dream to have a place where dogs - any dogs  can go and have fun; where dog trainers can come in and have a place to hold their classes LEGALLY; where dogs can run off leash without the fear of bothering other people or other dogs; and where rescue groups can get the assistance they need with the dogs in their possession. I have installed special flooring in the the 13,000 square foot at a cost of over $60,000, purchased supplies and equipment, paid over $100,000 in rents and deposits, hired professionals and paid part time salaries, paid utility costs etc. and have not taken a salary myself. We have a beautiful facility and now need additional operating capital to keep our doors open.PLEASE HELP. No donation is too small. If you can't participate financially, please post/share this link with your friends, family and any organization/Facebook page you can think of. Your donation or social media share helps me and the others who have tirelessly assisted in this dream, to continue to provide a place where dogs can experience a full gamut of activities in a clean safe environment.HERES A LITTLE MORE ABOUT US BuffDog Canine Fitness Center is an indoor facility devoted entirely to the good health of dogs through exercise, training, and behavior modification. Our programs include providing access to dog sports, assisting in rehabilitating troubled dogs, and just having a good time.

       "  'Robb and I met 8 years ago and weve been happily married for 3 years. We quickly fell in love and have been inseparable ever since. From the beginning we knew that we were meant to be parents and have a family. As some of you may know, weve experienced a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the past 3 years of trying to start our family. Our saga consists of 4 miscarriages, 3 surgeries, countless tests, and more heart break than one could ever imagine. We have been working with a fertility specialist for the past 2 years, who has helped guide us, support us, and at times be brutally honest with us. At this point there is no medical reason why my body will not sustain a pregnancy. On paper, both Robb and I are healthy 32yr olds, which has made understanding our battle even more difficult. During our pregnancies we were able to see 2 of our babies heartbeats. Talk about breathtaking moments, we felt over whelming joy and excitement. One pregnancy was over before it really even started. There was no time to be excited or plan. The 4th pregnancy was a tubal pregnancy that called for emergency surgery. All of our losses have been heartbreaking and traumatizing in their own way. I cannot begin to describe the emotions and feelings that are connected to a miscarriage. At times we felt as though we would never be able to get through it, we couldnt sleep, eat, or function, and other times it felt like a cruel joke was being played on us. The one thing that both Robb and I want more than anything was in our hands, only to be stolen away and ripped from our grasp.One might think that with all of our loss, struggles, and sorrow we would be bitter and angry. Anger and bitterness is a choice, and it is something we choose not to be. We have chosen to continue to love one another endlessly, and continue to support one another in our endeavors. Robb and I have grown and learned so much in the past 3years. We have weathered the storm, and have been led to the bright light of adoption. Our struggles have taught us that there is more than one way to be parents, and more than one way to have a family. We know that the road of adoption can be a bumpy one and that we will face many obstacles. Domestic infant adoption can range between $20-30 thousand dollars. We know that we could wait upwards of 2 years to be placed with our sweet baby, along with many trainings, educational classes, assessments, and endless amounts of paper work to be filled out and completed. We are ready to accept this challenge. We are willing to do what is necessary to fulfill our dreams.We are so blessed to be surrounded by such amazing people in our lives. We would not have even considered adoption if not for the encouragement of our friend and family. We have saved, cut corners, made sacrifices and have been able to start the process on own thus far. However, due to extensive medical bills coming in from infertility treatments and surgery from our last loss, we are unable to fund the whole adoption ourselves. We humbly and graciously ask for the support of our family and friends in our attempts to fund our adoption. We know that everyone is not in a place to donate financially, we would be ever so grateful for prayers and positive energy being sent our way. If you are moved to donate, any bit helps, we would be eternally thankful. We know that we have what it takes to be amazing parents, and we know that we have a foundation of amazing people in our lives to help, support, encourage, and raise out little one. We look so forward to the day that we can bring our baby home and introduce him/her to everyone that helped make our dreams of a family come true.Thank you so much for the encouragement and love that has been given to us though out the past 3 years. We could not ask for a better team to raise a child in. Thank you for having our backs emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Lets bring Baby Crane home!'),\n",

       "  \"Hi, I'm Erienne Murray.  My husband Nick and I have been together almost 8 years and have been married for 2 and a half of those 8 years. More than anything in the world, we want to be parents. Unfortunately it's not as easy as it sounds.  I have been a type 1 diabetic for 20 years. Due to my diabetes, and the complications that come from having diabetes, it is not safe or healthy for me to carry a baby. I have progressing kidney disease and ongoing vision loss. I am currently on a kidney/pancreas transplant list. It is possible I could have my transplant in the next year and if everything were to go well, it would greatly improve my quality of life. Even though we have a lot on our plate, we don't want to put our lives on hold and lose sight of our greatest wish, to be parents. So we have had to think of alternative ways to make this happen. Our sister-in-law, DeAnne, has offered to be a surrogate for us, which is amazing and this offering alone makes us feel very blessed!! However, the IVF and surrogacy process does not come on the cheap, especially when insurance doesn't cover anything. We've decided to reach out and tell our story, in hopes of helping with the costs. Thank you so much for your time! We know not everyone is able to donate money so thoughts and prayers are equally appreciated!!\"),\n",

       "  'As many of you know, Ray and I have been trying to get pregnant for a while. We tried on our own for almost four years. In June 2012 we went to the doctor. After many tests, procedures and lots of blood work we were told our only hope to get pregnant would be IVF (in-vitro fertilization). They gave us the brochure with the prices. He told us the total at the clinic alone would be $11,500. This price did not include medications, which can run anywhere from $3,500-$7,000. Sadly, infertility is not something covered by insurance. We were disappointed, but we were determined to have a family. I had surgery in August 2012 to clear my endometriosis. After surgery I began a medication to keep my endometriosis from coming back for 6 months. Shortly after this medication we finally got the news we would be starting the actual IVF medication.In late February 2013 I began the IVF medication. It was a strict regimen of multiple shots and pills. We did our egg retrieval and embryo transfer in March 2013. They were able to retrieve 4 eggs from me. After fertilization however, we only had one surviving embryo. We were a little discouraged, but as they say, \"It only takes one\". Two weeks after embryo transfer we got the blood work back that we were pregnant and my numbers were extremely high, so twins were a possibility!! We were so happy. Two weeks after my initial blood work is when our first ultrasound was scheduled. Patty, the ultrasound technician, immediately found the heartbeat. It was strong and she was very pleased. I asked her if she saw another baby because my beta levels were extremely high. She said no. She started to end the session when she made the discovery of TWIN B!! \"AHH! The embryo split, we now are having identical twins!\" was all I remember saying. At this point, we were over the moon with joy. After all this time, we were going to get two sweet babies to love!One week later was our next ultrasound. Twin A\\'s heartbeat was good and strong. Unfortunately, Twin B did not make it. We were sad, but very happy we still had a baby coming our way in November 2013.Everything was going great. We graduated out of Nashville Fertility Center and onto regular prenatal care. We had an ultrasound at 10 weeks and baby was doing great. On May 30th (about 14 weeks) an ER doctor did an ultrasound for me. There was nothing wrong; I just wanted to see my baby. I work in an ER, so he was happy to do one for me. The heartbeat was good, baby touched its face. I got to see the feet and toes. It was amazing.Our appointment to find out the gender was set for Saturday June 8th. We were so excited. This was going to be huge, after waiting for so long, we would finally know boy or girl! I laid down and the ultrasound technician started moving the wand over my belly. Baby was sleeping and it was looking as if we were not going to be finding out the sex, because baby was not turning. She had me bounce on a ball to wake baby up. When she tried again, she said that she was having a hard time finding the heartbeat. She said it may be the position. She recommended we call our doctor, get checked out, and we could reschedule the gender appointment.I called the doctor on call and he said we need to go to the ER and get a proper ultrasound. I called the charge nurse at Vandy and she had a room waiting for us. After telling the triage nurse what happened, she hugged me and said she was sorry. Immediately this caused panic in Ray, because I don\\'t think he realized what was happening. I think in the back of my mind I knew, but I was not going to give up hope yet. The doctor came in and did a portable ultrasound. He was unable to find the heartbeat. He said he was going to order a formal ultrasound. Patient transport took us to ultrasound and the waiting was killing us. When she began, she was very quiet. She only asked us to tell the story. I tell her the shortest version possible and she was still quiet. After she took about 15 images of the baby, I asked her, \"You can\\'t find the heartbeat either, can you?\". Our entire future was hanging on her response and then she finally said \"No, I can\\'t find the heartbeat.\"We were heartbroken. Devastation is a light description of what we were feeling. We woke up that morning prepared to go pick out paint colors for the room and just like that our baby was gone. The OB resident came in and gave us our options. We chose to be induced and deliver our baby. I was admitted to labor and delivery around 10pm. At 11pm, I was given the first dose of medication to induce me. I was given my second dose at 3am and another at 7am. I was having contractions, but not as many as they would have liked. Around 10am, the doctors came in and said they would like to try one of two options to speed things along. I told them, they could choose, whichever they feel would be best. I\\'ll spare you of all the gory details, but after a painful hour of trying the first method, they opted to try the second method. The second method immediately worked and the contractions began coming much more frequently. I received my epidural around 7:30 pm. This eased my pain quite a bit. At 9:17pm, I delivered a sweet baby boy. He was so little and frail. We held him and loved on him. I sang him a song and Ray talked to him. The nurse took him away briefly to prepare us some mementos that included pictures, hats, booties, wristbands, and a card with his name, time of birth, height, and weight. We named him Raymond Stanley, after Ray and my late grandfather. We said our goodbyes and told him we loved him one last time. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing we\\'ve ever had to do. After all the pain, stress, heartache, and disappointment we are still hopeful to have our family. We have decided to try IVF again. Unfortunately with my endometriosis, we must start the process much sooner than we would like. If we wait too long, medicine will not keep my endometriosis away and I will have to have surgery. With that being said we are asking for your help. Our last cycle of IVF cost us a little under $20,000 after everything was said and done. We paid the last cycle with our savings, two HSA\\'s, money from Ray\\'s mom, money borrowed from my Nonny, and the rest on zero interest credit cards. We know that times are hard and understand if you can\\'t donate, but we ask that you please share our story with your friends and family. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also, prayers are so important to us too. We thank you in advance for your help; your contribution means more than you will ever know. With Love and Thanks, Ray and Devin'),\n",

       "  \"Hello! We are the Laban's! My name is Niki and I would like to introduce a little bit about my husband Tom and myself. Our story started 6 years ago in September 2008, when we married. Tom joined the United States Navy in November 2008. HOME is where the NAVY takes us, which currently is Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After we were married we decided we immediately wanted to start a family. We tried for a few years without success and decided to attempt fertility treatments. We went through several years of different types of treatment without success. We decided to stop fertility treatments and look into adoption. In 2010, shortly after making the decision to stop treatment we met a young girl who was looking to make an adoption plan for her baby. We met with her and immediately bonded, she made the decision to choose us to raise her baby. Little did any of us know at the time, she was pregnant with twins. Unfortunately at 20 weeks she went into preterm labor and delivered our twin boys, Eli Thomas and Hunter Luke. Due to their extreme prematurity they passed away shortly after birth. We were completely devastated, our hearts were shattered. We took a few years to grieve and then decided we wanted to consider fertility treatments again. We tried a new treatment and again we were faced with no success. In 2013 a friend of ours told us a story about a young mother who was pregnant and considering adoption for her baby. We began talking to this courageous girl, giving her support and encouragement. A few weeks before she was due, she let us know that she was going to parent instead of place her baby with us. We were saddened to learn of this but supported her decision. We were thankful she even considered choosing us to raise her baby. After careful evaluation of our situation and mourning the loss of Eli and Hunter as well as a failed adoption, we have decided to try adoption again. We recently started working with an adoption consultant and are extremely excited with their dedication and determination to make our dreams come true. We are excited but extremely nervous of the costs involved. We never realized how expensive working with an agency would cost. Unfortunately, insurance does not cover adoption fees. Due to our extenuating circumstances of living on a secluded military base overseas, and the difficult task of adopting while living here our consultant has suggested we begin our efforts by asking our family and friends to consider helping us make our dream a reality. We prayerfully ask that you consider helping us in our effort to raise money. Over the next year and a half we plan to hold several fundraiser events, save as much as we can, and live as frugally as possible. We have set a goal to raise at least half of the cost by the time we return the the United States in hopes that we can start growing our family immediately. So, as much as we really dislike asking for help this is what we are doing. Anything will help, there is no amount too small or too large. Even if you cannot afford to donate please consider sharing this link with family and friends. Networking is our biggest advantage to sucess!! Thank you all so very, very much for taking the time to review our cause and helping us achieve our dreams of growing our family.Follow along on our blog for updates:  http://2008labanslately.blogspot.com/\"),\n",

       "  \"We are The LaBerges from King, NC and we are hoping you can help us grow our family! We met in high school and have been together ever since. Our marriage took place in may of 2008 and that is when our true adventure began. We knew we wanted to have children pretty soon into our marriage after being together for so long, so immediately following my first year of graduate school, we got started :) After our first few years of really putting our all into it with no success, we thought perhaps we were just unlucky. After all, we are beyond blessed! Maybe it just wasn't our time right? After another year of prayer, fasting, & more prayer, we decided we should seek help. 8 months of conservative and non- invasive procedures with our fabulous Obgyn, we still ended the party with a goose egg. That's right....zilch. Ronnie and I decided we would take my doctors advice and have an IVF consult with a center in Charlotte. At first they seemed so sympathetic and understanding. They were certain they could help us have a baby! No problem they said, you both are young and healthy, this is going to be the easiest IVF session we've ever done they said. We were on cloud nine! This is really happening we thought! We are really going to have a baby!!!!Then the price tag came. $20,000 didn't sound so terrible when you look at the end result right? We swallowed hard, took their medicine, went through the very stressful procedure, and yep....you guessed it. Our family still only has two members. They were left scratching their heads...as were we, but then no compassion, sympathy, here's our next step or anything. We were told we would be refunded a portion of our money but after six months of battle, we got apporox $200 back. That was only when we expressed an interest to have another session.So we ended up in the wonderful hands of Wake Forest with Dr Johnston and Dr Yalcinkaya. We decided to see if they could help. After another $20,000, we felt so blessed to get extremely far along in the process. We had 2 fantastic embryos that formed out of 19 eggs pulled. We decided to place both embryos, but sadly they didn't implant into the womb.We are initiating our 3rd try for a LaBerge baby in January. After our last conversation with Dr Johnston, she feels like with a couple of medication changes, we can do this :) We feel overwhelmingly blessed by our Heavenly Father to have had the means and love and support to have went through this process twice. We are hoping that you will be able to share your love and support with us for our third round to achieve our ultimate goal.... A complete family! Your generosity is beyond appreciated... And if you can't donate, please leave a note of encouragement and do something nice for someone that can use your love :)\"),\n",

We have been with the same agency for over 2 years and we have gone through 4 failed matches during this time! We can honestly say God brought us through the rough times and we trusted His plan without questioning Him. His timing is always perfect!!!! He has been leading us to change our direction for a few months now but we were hesitant because the new direction would cost more money!! (We must have forgotten He owns a cattle on a thousand hills) He finally got our attention when we got our 4th confirmation that we are suppose to go with Faithful Adoption Consultants!!! Faithful Adoption Consultants work with agencies and lawyers in safe states across the U.S., and the average wait for a baby is 4.5 months...since we are wanting to adopt minority (because true love sees no color) and the average wait for minority is 2 months!!!!!  We are around$12,000 short of our goal!!!  I know it seems like such a mountain and believe me, we have stared the mountain down, but Ava Grace says it only takes a little faith!!! We have been blessed with an abundance of love, prayers, support, and financial blessings from our family, AMAZING church family, and friends the last 2-1/2 years, and for that we are GRATEFUL!!! We just want to say a HUGE thank you to everyone that has encouraged us and supported us on this wild ride!!! We would just ask you all to continue to pray, as we go in this new direction, that He will keep His hand on the precious baby, that He chooses for us until we hold him/her in our arms. Please also pray that He blesses our efforts to raise money and that it happens FAST!!! Every penny brings us closer!!! So here's to fundraising again...It will all be worth it!!!

       "  \"Some of you may know our story, but for those of you that don't we would like to share it with you. We are high school sweethearts and have been together since the young age of 14. After graduating from college, we were married at the age of 23. After our first year of marriage we began trying to have our first baby. We have dreamed of having a large family for a very long time. After more than a year of our unsuccessful attempts, we saw a doctor. Becca was diagnosed with PCOS in 2011. At that point we were referred to a Reproductive Endocrinologist, also known as an RE. Our RE did testing and bloodwork and confirmed that Becca does in fact have PCOS (or Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome), but the news didn't end there. In addition to the PCOS, she is also insulin resistant. At this point, our RE wanted to check Donny for any obstacles as well. That's when we discovered the hits just kept coming. In addition to all of the obstacles we are facing with Becca, Donny was diagnosed with a low sperm and low motility count.With this heart breaking news, we had to decide on our next plan of action. With the guidance of our RE, we chose IUI(intrauterine insemanation). Insurance would not cover any medical expenses for our fertility treatments, so we saved and saved and saved. In November of 2012, we went in for our first IUI and two weeks later we discovered it did not take. We held our heads high and started saving for round two! In December 2012, we completed our second round of IUI and with every prayer and wish we hoped for a positive test on Christmas, but it wasn't our time. Round three of IUI took place in February 2013, and with little faith we waited. The moment we'd been waiting for finally came when Becca tested positive for pregnancy! We were over the moon with excitement and called our RE immediately. The next morning we received devastating news. The bloodwork showed we were in fact pregnant, but that the numbers were not increasing and we would most likely lose our baby. About two weeks later and after constant bloodwork, Becca miscarried. We refused to give up and our wonderful RE had no attentions of failure. Our next option was Superovulation IUI(orIUI with injectables). First step, Becca would undergo day surgery to confirm that she was a good candidate for this procedure. The surgery went smoothly, however, Donny was a nervous wreck the entire time. We are still paying for the cost of this day surgery.Onceour RE confirmed that this was the next best step for us we decided to go for it. Superovulation IUI cost a considerable amount more, so after more and moresaving, in August of 2013 we finally had the money for round FOUR.We thoughtthe IUI's were a lot to handle, butboy were we wrong. Afteran instructional class and scheduling our date, Becca began giving her selfshots daily for two weeks (which was considerably scarier than we thought it would be). She went in every 48-72 hours for bloodwork and ultrasounds. The day finally came for our fourth IUI and the procedure wentsmoothly.With prayers and wishes and sleepless nights we waited and waited. After possibly the longest two weeks of our lives, our hearts were crushed...again. Becca was not pregnant. We are devasted. We did it right, we dated for years, graduated from college, got married, have dogs to love and our dream jobs. But we still feel incomplete. After spending thousands of dollars on our previous procedures and still coming up with empty arms we are asking for your help. We would love the chance to have In Vitro Fertilization. Our dream of having a baby is a far stretch and we can't do it on our own. In Vitro Fertilization cost approximately $13,000. Insurance does not cover a single penny. We are saving but it's hard on our own. Our prides aren't too big to ask for your assistance in reaching our goal. Any amount would help. Would you please donate to us for a chance to help us fill our home and our hearts with the blessing of a baby? In addition, we ask that you pray. Pray for us, pray for our family. Prayer is power and we have no doubt our Lord's plan for us to become parents will happen. With all our love,Donny & Becca\"),\n",

       "  \"Our Story,Amanda and I have been married for just over 4 years and the time has flown by. We have always been an active and busy couple, working hard and participating in the many activities we are involved in. Although we feel abundantly blessed with each other and or wonderful friends and family, there is still apart of us that doesnt feel whole. Amanda and I have been trying to start a family for a little over 3 years with no such luck. We have spent over $15,000 in fertility drugs and appointments, unfortunately none of which is covered by our medical insurance. Doctors have diagnosed Amanda with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), meaning she doesnt ovulate on her own which causes her to get cysts on her ovaries which are usually very painful. We have decided to take the next step in infertility which is In vitro Fertilization (IVF). Many of you might be asking yourself, what is IVF? IVF is the joining of a woman's egg and a man's sperm in a laboratory dish. In vitro means outside the body, fertilization means the sperm has attached to and entered the egg. Sounds crazy and expensive right? IVF has roughly a 62% success right, which depending on your point of view, might seem like pretty good odds or not so good odds at all. Coming from our point of view 62% of a chance to have a little one is far better than what our odds look like without doing IVF. In the past, Amanda had been taking Clomid and Metformin shots which were supposed to help with ovulation induction. The success rate for those shots are at 20%. We tried what they called cycles numerous times without any luck and, at $800-1200 a cycle, the bills added up quickly. This brings us to where we are at now- instead putting money towards pills and shots we have decided to try IVF. The price for one round of IVF is different for every patient. For Amanda and me they have estimated the cost to be between $13,000-$20,000 which absolutely zero is covered by insurance and is ALL due by your first appointment. The $13,000-$20,000 we will be financing on our own, what we would like to ask help for is the 5-$10,000 it will cost for medications and two separate procedures called HSG and a SIS/TET. These two procedures Amanda will be having this Thursday and Friday and will help the doctors determine if her tubes are clear and healthy for when they transfer they embryo. The whole process from start to finish usually takes two months. With that all being said we know it is just a 62% chance, and we are fine with that. We are putting it into Gods hands and praying for the best. What we do have going for us is the Doctors have never told us we CANT have a baby and that gives us hope!  There are thousands of couples going through the exact thing my wife and I are. Its almost like we have a disease which we are ashamed of, hiding behind every questing that is asked of when are you having kids!? dont worry, its not your fault for asking! Its ours for not being upfront! It is a very stressful situation that we hide behind. We have decided to share our story and ask for help.. no more hiding and no more feeling like we are different. Dont be scared to ask us about it, we are coming forward and it will help us with the process along the way! Taking this step of putting our story out there has been a very hard decision to make; we are both very hard working and independent people who are proud of what we have. In order to do this we realize that we need all the help we can get. Thank you for taking the time to read our story.

       "  'With the blessing of the Whitney family and a little help from family and friends - I am setting up this Go Fund Me page in memory of Ciara Jolie Whitney: what a bright, beautiful soul who is missed, who is mourned, who is loved.We lost this beautiful child far too soon and as a community we are heartbroken. As members of the Daniel Boone School District we are devastated. As friends of the Whitney family we are at a loss for words. So many people have approached me about what they can do to help this family, to honor Ciara. Well, we may not have the words, but together we have the power. We have the power to help Steve, Karen and Ciara\\'s brother Zach honor their daughter, their sister, our friend, by making a donation to The Ciara Whitney Scholarship Fund. This fund will help provide an annual award scholarship to a student at Daniel Boone High School to pursue a degree in the Arts. By making a donation to the scholarship fund we are not only enriching the life of a Daniel Boone student, but we are honoring the memory of Ciara. Beautiful, colourful, contagious Ciara. This is a difficult time for all of us - the loss is almost unbearable. Let\\'s join together and help this family honor the memory of their beautiful daughter and sister.  To Steve and Karen - thank you for sharing your daughter with us - we are better having known her. To Zach - we are here for you, whatever you need - whenever you need us.To the grieving students at Boone and surrounding school districts: you are not alone - reach out to a parent or to a friend - we\\'re all in this together. #ciarastrong\"How far we travel in life, matters far less than those we meet along the way\"Jamie Roth was the kind of man who lit up a room. He had an infectious smile and an incredible energy to him that everyone loved. You felt good just sharing a space with him. He was an avid fly fisherman and music lover, in addition to being a gifted guitar player. Additionally, Jamie was a Bronze Star recipient and proud veteran of the U.S. Army. Sadly, Jamie left this world on Saturday, April 8, 2017. He leaves behind so many who loved him, including his high school sweetheart & best friend, Alicia, and their two daughters, Kensy & Madi.Financial burdens are an unfortunate side effect of losing a loved one, but no family should have to worry about this while simultaneously going through such a devastating loss. In an effort to help the family with any financial hardships, we\\'ve created this Go Fund Me account to assist with any immediate needs in Jamie\\'s memorial planning. Beyond that, all contributions will go to providing education & living costs for his two daughters. We\\'ve set the initial goal at $10,000 and will adjust that as needed. Thank you so much for any and all donations to this beautiful family.Please help us by donating to a local family, Ken Brenda and Steven Bauer. Brenda co-signed a student loan for a young man who sadly passed away last year. Times are tough for everyone and this added expense of $32,000.00 is way to much to be able to manage.Thank you all so very much. Please share this and help spread the word to help them out. All the funds will go toward the oustanding student loan debt and any other expenses.Donations can also be made directly to Flag Star Bank in Chelsea, MI.  Make checks payable to Ken Bauer and in memo line write student loan fund. Address is 1290 S. Main St. Suite A, Chelsea, MI. 48118.My friend Richard Downer loves togive.And as a mentor at McArthur High School in Hollywood, Florida, he gets plenty of opportunities to advise young people who need a person to talk with and to show them what it takes to pursue a successful life. Richardoffers a powerful example of someone who has overcome some obstacles. Hehas cerebral palsy. He is 50 years old and has been confined to a wheelchair his entire life.But that did not stop him from living a full and successful life. Richardretired from a 24 year career with Miami-Dade County Public Schools where he worked as a paraprofessional and then a teacher of adult basic education.I did not want to sit and do nothing and I like working with teenagers. So I became a mentor. I am here to talk with the students. I tell them about the importance of making good choices, overcoming obstacles and the importance of career planning, said Downer. I tell them about the value of hard work and that there is nothing you cant overcome if you have perseverance.Downer wants to expand his mission. He has created a non-profit 501C3 organizationcalled Teaching Involves Mentoring and Education (TIME). He hopes this organization will allow him to reach more young people.And he has a strong rapport with young people, many of whom are facing struggles of their own. Downers sits in an outdoor area in front of the school and talks with the young people about the challenges they are going through. He has a pleasant personality and is willing to listen to the students about tests both in school and in the real world they must face. He will bring clothing and school supplies to students who need these items.Being a high school student today is not easy. The students have many challenges including the passing of state mandated tests. I want to establish relationships with them and I hope they will keep in touch after they graduate from McArthur, said Downer.And young people gravitate to Downer. Kristopher R, 18, a senior said, He talks with me and guides me in the right direction. Now I am working at Publix. I want to be an Air Force pilot, said Kristopher.Pablo V, 17, a junior said, I enjoy talking with him when he comes to the school. Raymond L, 15, also enjoyedthe chance to meet with Downer.Mthokozisi AshleySibisi has been overcoming obstacles his entire life. Orphaned at an early age, Ashley and his younger sister were raised by their maternal grandparents in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Ashley discovered his love for soccer when he was very young. As his passion grew, so did his talent; he could be found playing soccer every chance he got and he began to stand out amongst his peers. After multiple campaigns with Zimbabwes Youth National Team, Ashley was given the chance of a lifetime: to attend boarding school in Alexandria, Virginia. In 2012, he left his remaining family and friends in hopes of making something of himself in America.During his time at boarding school, Ashley worked hard in the classroom, which was no small challenge. He also continued to excel on the soccer field. His play caught the eye of several college coaches which manifested in a offer to play at the Division II level in the mid-Atlantic region. Ashley worked incredibly hard to secure a full scholarship for tuition, but unfortunately this does not cover room and board expenses.Ashley has touched so many lives in his time in the United States, and the time to give back has arrived. In order to make his collegiate dream a reality, funds must be raised to offset Ashleys room, board, health insurance, and living expenses. Simply stated, if these needs arent met, Ashley will return to Zimbabwe and not attend college here.Every bit helps, no matter the size. For Ashley, the odds have never seemed to be in his favor, but time and time again, he has overcome challenges and has made his own luck. Please be a part of his story!---------------Some details of the campaign:---------------My name is COL (Ret) Dave Anderson of Alexandria, VA. In coordination with Episcopal High School, my wife and I served as co-host to Ashley since he arrive in the US from Zimbabwe in August 2012.To be clear, all donated funds will be deposited into an account that will be dedicated for this purpose. I will make disbursements from the account directly to the University, to the health insurance provider, and for recurring living expenses for Ashley.------------Thanks for your support!Gabbie and Alice are second graders at the George J. Mitchell School in Waterville, Maine. The school, demographically, based on the number of students receiving free or reduced lunch, is one of the poorest in the state. In an effort to prevent evening/weekend/vacation hunger among its students and their families, the school opened a no questions asked food pantry IN the school in 2013. Best friends Gabbie and Alice, knowing the school\\'s dire situation, decided to hold a joint 8th birthday party, in which they asked for donations to the food pantry, in lieu of gifts. Their teacher, Mrs. Saulter, was so touched by their plans, that she secretly asked the PTO what they could do to make a big deal of these generous, selfless young ladies. PTO President Jennifer Johnson thought what better way to celebrate them than to make their wish come true on the largest possible scale? The food pantry has operating costs of $5,000/year. Raising $5k would mean Gabbie and Alice made sure families in need were fed for an entire year. Raising $50k would feed this town in need for TEN years. And for $100k, Gabbie and Alice would feed needy kids in the school for TWENTY YEARS! With the food pantry funded for twenty years, the school would be able to afford to expand to include fourth and fifth graders, a much needed expansion for this small town. So please, won\\'t you help us celebrate Gabbie and Alice\\'s 8th birthdays by making their wildest dreams come true? What they want more than anything is for their classmates and their families to be taken care of. Every single little donation helps, and encourages not only these girls, but others that come after them, to embrace the spirit of community and generosity. It sends the message that even kids can make a difference in the world. It feeds a families in need. And it will make these girls\\' 8th birthday party one this community will NEVER forget.

Help spread the word!Who Are We?We are David and LaTonya Whitaker of Taste The Love, a food service company of American Southern, Cajun/Creole and Tex- Mex cuisines in the heart of Tokyo. Our storystarts with Thanksgiving 2005. After moving to Japan in 2005, David & LaTonya Whitaker wanted to be with family for Thanksgiving. So we invited everyone we knew to our house for a Thanksgiving dinner. About 50 people came,ate and enjoyed themselves. The next year we did it again and more people came. This has been repeated every year since, only increasing in the amount of people coming most through word of mouth. We just wanted to provide a place of comfort that felt like family and a home away from home; Where everyone could experience true southern hospitality and the heart & culture behind great food and music. In 2013 Taste The Love\\'s was formed with the desire to bring a piece of our American home to the hearts & tables of Japan using fresh and local ingredients. That desire has grown into providing english/gospel cooking classes, catering and consulting services. However, Taste The Love is planning to expand its current operation to what has always been the dream; a food kitchen. It is our prayer that everyone who cooks in our classes or eats in our kitchen can taste the love therefore feeding both the stomach and the soul. & Taste The Love / 200520051502013Taste The LoveWhat Do We Want To Do?By summer 2015 we would like to open the Soul Food House, a southern cajun/creole kitchen and gospel cooking school in Tokyo, Japan. We want to provide a space where people can come as they are and have a great dining and learning experience.To be more exact we want to:1. Offer English Gospel Cooking Classes1 2. American Style Lunch Bentos using local & fresh ingredients.2. 3. Provide an evening Southern Hospitality dining experience & offer take out during that time.3.4. Offer products, such as spices, sauces and dressings to assist in recreating meals at home easier.4. (Taste The Love )\\n\\nWhy Are We Trying To Do It?1. Feed my sheep is the message that rest in the heart of Taste The Love.1. Growing up in the South, we have come to know good food from the heart, that is filled with love, builds community. That\\'s the heart of southern hospitality. It feeds the belly, the heart and soul. We also want to educate individuals on what American food is, destroying the misconception that our main foods are only hamburgers, hotdogs and pizza.2. Japan has a growing consumer interest and demand for quality international food, with a love of American food in particular. However, it is important to cook and teach food that is quality, and has an authentic American taste but is compatible with the Japanese palate and in a size that is appropriate for the Japanese.3. Not everyone does well learning English in a traditional classroom. Therefore we at Taste The Love would like to continue building customers skills through hobby English. Students will be able to learn English through cooking, music and relationships. Through Gospel Cooking Classes, We have seen student\\'s English ability improved more in 3 years than we could have imagine. As one student stated \"I just simple wanted to communicate with the teacher more and learn more about the food and music, so I studied more.\" That regular student went from barely being able to formulate a sentence to translating for the teacher and all within 2 years.Taste The Love )32What the financial goal is We are aiming to raise $250,000 (27,000,000). The money will be used for:-Initial rental space cost -Reform/renovation and furnishing start-up cost -Initial running costs & staff training-Change of Visa status to Business Investor Visas252700--/- -What We HaveExperienceWe have been teaching gospel cooking classes within the Kanto and Kansai area for four years.

Tokyo is the most visited city in Japan and it has the most concentrated, diverse set of hungry people in the country from all over the world All are looking for great food and many would love how to cook it in there homes. BBQ Ribs, Jambalaya, Macaroni and Cheese, Mash Potatoes, Cheesecake or Pecan Pie can all be eaten and learned at the Soul Food House and done easily at home.130Taste The Love  & The Soul Food House After writing this proposal hundreds of times and all the number crunching, we\\'ve come up with this conclusion: the food needs to be great, the place needs to be authentic, and the key ingredient needs to be Love.After a devastating loss to Eric Valainis the wife Joann Valainis and Daughters Brooke and Amber Valainis will need a lot of help for the next couple weeks to month\\'s for this very difficult time for Brookes school, bills and stuff the family will need as well as all the expencises that Joann will have. Anything will help Brooke has graduation coming shortly and all the things we all know Eric wanted to do for his daughters and Wife would be nice to be able to carry on what he would have loved to finish but couldn\\'t. Anything would be greatly appreciated.We always called Ms. Miller our drama mama. To all of her students she was more than a high school theatre teacher. Each year, Ms. Miller invested her time, energy, and love to her students at Watauga High School. She would spend countless hours teaching us how to become other characters on the stage, but she spent even more time teaching us how to become ourselves. She celebrated every curtain call with us, as well as every college acceptance or personal success. She was there for us during our most formative years. She loved us and believed in us and dreamed with us.She was more than a high school teacher to us. She was our drama mama. And we love her dearly. Ms. Miller and Dylan at the White House, Ms. Miller and Kevin after Footloose.We were elated when we found out she wanted to share her love with a baby through adoption. We began talking about what names we liked best, what books we would read to her child, and who would be the best babysitter. We were excited to welcome this baby into a big village. Ms. Miller with Nephew Hunter.Last month, we were ecstatic to learn that an expectant mother from the West Coast expressed interest in Ms. Miller. But several days later, Ms. Millers adoption agency declared bankruptcy, abruptly and permanently closing overnight. Ms. Miller had spent years saving money and meeting with financial advisors to cover her adoption expenses. Adoption agencies require substantial upfront payment, and Ms. Miller invested thousands in this agency, with confidence that they were one of the oldest and largest agencies in the country. When the agency declared chapter 7 bankruptcy, Ms. Miller discovered that she and other former clients should not expect to get the money they paid to the agency back. As you can imagine, this is a huge financial setback. Fortunately, the expectant mother reached out to Ms. Miller after the bankruptcy, and still wishes to move forward with an adoption placement plan. Ms. Miller has found a new set of lawyers and a new adoption agency to re-do her home study and other paperwork. This means paying again for services she had previously paid for through the bankrupt agency. Ms. Miller with her sister and mother.We need your help to keep these new expenses from standing in the way of making this dream a reality. This placement could happen in mid-May, and we want to help Ms. Miller get to the West Coast to be there for the babys birth. Please share this page widely and give whatever you can to this incredible drama mama. While we are still waiting and while so many unknown variables remain in the air, we are undoubtedly sure of one thing: witnessing Ms. Millers resilience, grace, and love have reaffirmed our belief that Ms. Miller is ready for this child. The love that this baby will inherit is inspiring. And this big village is ready for one more.Ms. Miller playing with her nieceand nephew and father after a 5k.Please direct further inquires to Kevin Logan or Dylan Russell. logankjl@gmail.comand gdylan@live.unc.edu.Sadly, this page is here to support an amazing family who has suffered an unimaginable and tragic loss.

He recently set a goal for himself: Ashton wants to break the Guinness World Record for longest hair, and then donate the hair to kids with cancer. What parent could say no to that? Ashton had been growing his hair out for almost 2 years when his school, Rapides Parish, said he couldnt return to school until he cut his hair. We were shocked. Ashton, a great student who had never been in trouble, was being denied his education because his hair was too long. Ashton\\'s school should be applauding him for wanting to help kids with cancer, not punishing him. Schools should not use hair length to determine whether or not a child is fit to attend. Tell the Rapides Parish School Board to end its policy on hair length.In this day and age, I never thought the length of a students hair would be a concern of our public schools. I never imagined a beautiful goal could get him expelled. Had Ashton been a girl, this wouldnt be an issue. That is wrong and I will not allow my sons dream to be crushed because of an outdated policy.Ashton is a good kid. He gets good grades and is always on his best behavior. My son stands up for other kids when they are being bullied. These should be the things that the school should use to measure whether he is fit to attend classes. Instead, the school wants to measure his hair.With your help we\\'ll not only make sure that Ashton can realize his dream of helping kids with cancer, but also end an outdated policy that discriminates against students based on their hair length.I ask please help me in my fight against gender discrimination and the freedom to have long hair.#LongHairFreedomTHANK YOU!!! :-)Charles Butler was a 2015 Dutchtown High School graduate with his sights set on attending Southeastern Louisiana University to continue to make his mother proud. On Sunday, August 9th, Charles\\' mother, Monica, threw him a family party to celebrate his journey off to college. The family was not prepared for the tragic way it would end.  Charles\\' stepfather broke into their home that night and murdered his mother Monica with Charles and his little brother present in the home. Charles sustained a broken arm as he tried to save his mom. After hearing the tragic news, my daughter Alexis and her friend Hannah wanted to reach out and help their class and track team mate in any way possible. We found out that after the funeral services conclude, Charles is still going to pursue his college dream for his mom. Alexis and Hannah feel that setting up this donation account would help him greatly as he starts his college journey.  Alexis and Hannah will take all the donations and present it to Charles from his 2015 classmates to show their love and support during this difficult time in his life.  Please keep Charles and his family in your prayers.In lieu of flowers we want to establish a college fund for Mike and Shelly Bushnell\\'s 3 children. Shelly was a loving, caring, passionate educator and we know that she would be honored that we are carrying her legacy forward by establishing this fund for her kiddos. \\nThe perfect description of Shelly as penned by a friend.\\n\" She was the more quiet one, not one for the spot light, a wonderful dedicated mother, the wind beneath Michael Bushnell\\'s wings, a faithful servant of God, had a passion for educating children at school and church, a compassionate friend, the best bread pudding maker ever and so much more.\" \\n\\n\\nWe will miss our dear friend, but find comfort knowing she is resting peacefully in God\\'s arms. There is no doubt that Shelly Harty Bushnell had a reserved spot in heaven. She was truly a good and faithful servant.If you believe that education can change someone\\'s life, please read this: Hello. My name is Natalia Moura and I am a senior Chemical Engineering student at Tulane University about to graduate in May.  I am originally from Par, a state in the north of Brazil, and I first came to New Orleans as an exchange student on a scholarship sponsored by the government of my country. Eighteen months later, when such scholarship ended, I applied to be a transfer student at Tulane and was admitted with an academic achievement scholarship award. However, this scholarship has a maximum amount, which of course, does not cover full tuition. I am now running the risk of not being able to graduate and accept the offer I have received to do my masters and PhD at LSU because I owe Tulane University about $10,000.Just so that you know a little about me: I am the first to graduate from college in my family. My grandmother is illiterate, and my parents do not have a high-school degree. Graduating is my dream, and I need your help to make it come true. I have recently been awarded a full scholarship and a Teaching-Assistantship for a PhD program at LSU. However, my transcript and diploma will not be released because I have a tuition balance at Tulane. My family cannot afford to help me due to the terrible economic situation in Brazil right now. Most of my friends who live there now are unemployed and cannot help me financially either. Since I am not an American citizen, I cannot ask for a loan, unless I have an American co-signer. I am a Dean\\'s List student, who has published two research articles, and I am also a recipient of the William F. Canning Award for Excellence, Leadership and Performance. I have asked the university for a higher scholarship since I have proven that I am committed and dedicated to my studies and work, however, Tulane says there is a maximum amount that can be given to international students, and I have already reached such amount. In addition to being a full-time Chemical Engineering student, I have two jobs. I work more than 30 hours a week while taking 19 credit hours. I also babysit, dogsit, and tutor. Still I cannot afford to pay my remaining balance. This is my last semester in school  actually, my last few days - and I desperately need help. I need to pay this balance ASAP or I will keep being charged finance charges because it is past due. My classes at Classes at LSU start on August 22nd, and I must provide my transcript and diploma to them within a month after that date. I would not be able to express in words how much graduating means to me. I never thought I would get this far coming from such a small city in Brazil and, especially, from such a poor and uneducated family background. I have had help from a lot of friends, who have fed me, given me a place to live, and a shoulder to cry on. I am not giving up now and I really need your help. Your donation will change my life forever, and one day I am sure I will be able to repay every single person who has helped me thus far. Please help me graduate and get my diploma. You will certainly impact my life with your donation. No matter the amount you can contribute.Jeremy Harrisis a sophomore at New York University. Originally from a small town, Hutchinson, Minnesota, Jeremy came to NYU and nothing stopped him from taking every opportunity he was given in the city. In just a year and a half Jeremy has already been a summer RA, thrived as a baritone in a top-notch a cappella group (The Mixtapes), worked several days/nights a week at the Resource Center, all while keeping up phenomenal grades and honing his acting and dance skills.\\n\\nRecently, NYU denied Jeremy financial aid for the spring semester (boooooooo) and this means he will have to leave all of his friends, all of his hard work thus far, and New YorkCity behind.\\n\\nOur goal is reachable, but we have limited time!!! We need to raise$7864 by Monday, January 26thso that Jeremy can register for this semester. Even getting close to the full amount will be helpful. If it wasn\\'t this important, we wouldn\\'t bother. But all of us who know Jeremy know that he NEEDS to stay and he will continue his successat NYU. No one is more deserving.\\n\\nLuckily, in the fall of 2015 Jeremy can (and will, surely) become an RA, which means his housing costs will be eliminated. So we just need to get him through one more semester, and we think we can do it with your help.\\n\\nPlease donate and share this link toEVERYONE. The deadline is close. No time to waste. THANK YOU!!!\\n\\nLove,\\n\\nJeremy\\'s classmates and friends!MISSION:We are a delegation of five emerging young leaders with a small support team from Maui, Hawai`i going to Paris for the United Nations COP21 negotiations. We wish to ensure that an indigenous youth voice is heard throughout these global conversations on climate change. Each of us are currently engaged in caring for and protecting the ina of Maui. We view this journey as a way to create long-lasting relationships with international and indigenous leaders and build a bridge of mutual support between caretakers and protectors of culture and the environment in Hawai`i and the rest of the world. We plan to bring our experiences back to Maui to share with our home community and use them to inspire, inform and activate our families, friends and associates toward greater love and care for the earth in practical and effective ways. For full bios of the delegates please go to: Locals for Local ChangeACTIVITIES:We will be involved in specific global events and activities in Paris:- Conference of Youth (COY11)-Voices4Mother Earth World Wisdom Gathering - Voice & Action forMother Earth Ceremonies- COP 21- Place to B Hub1) Conference of Youth (COY11) Nov. 26-28 - We will be participating in a gathering of more than 5,000 international youth to build strategies for mobilization, exchange stories, sustainable practices and climate change solutions. 2)Voices4Mother Earth World Wisdom Gathering  Dec. 1-5 -An \"invite-only\" 5 day, deep, co-creational ceremonial gathering with Global Indigenous Elders to:(1) create a unified vision and new paradigm, based on our sacredconnection to Mother Earth(2) design a way to present this vision and new paradigm to theworld to raise global consciousness, and(3) explore and co-create ways and processes to ensure that this new paradigm will be the foundation of all our future actions.

The focus is to answer the question:\"What does Nature have to say to defend itself?\"Then they will discuss how to move forward by listening to the youth and asking the question:\"What are we going to do?\" On this day we have been invited along with other indigenous youth to step into the center of this ceremony to be encircled by our Global Indigenous Elders and invited to share our vision for the future.4) COP21 (21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -UNFCCC) Nov. 30-Dec. 11 - We will join major public sector events and learning spaces, both sanctioned and unsanctioned, surrounding the COP21 negotiations.

In addition to our diversity we hold between us a powerful commitment to help create a healthy and vibrant future for the coming generations. We all agree this future must first start with our relationship to the ina, (the land).Climate change is a globally unifying issue that our generation must acknowledge and work with head-on. One of our missions is to build a bridge for the flow of `ike (knowledge) between Hawaii and the rest of the world. We come from the most remote place on planet earth, over 4000 kilometers away from the largest land mass. We are an island nation. Islands and coastal peoplesare many of the first communities to suffer the major effects of climate change. This means that our physical homes, families and culture are in direct danger zones. We feel that it is paramount to go to Paris to learn more about where climate change action stands today, globally. We want to bring home education and ideas on these vital matters to better inform and activate our communities here on Maui.We are eager to connect, share ideas and h (breath) with like-minded youth from all over the world. We especially look forward to meeting our indigenous brothers, sisters and elders who can teach us their ancient ways of co-existing with this earth. We are so excited to learn and make connections!Some important questions we are carrying to Paris:What is truly possible globally when individuals begin to take action locally within their own communities?How do we effectively get more of our friends, family members, work associates and acquaintances on Maui to take greater and immediate responsibility through their own actions to address the larger issues of consumption and waste that are robbing from the health of the aina and the earth?How can we better make the connection between the global movement against GMO and Hawais key role as a GMO seed production hub and as an open-air experimental lab for bio-techs industrial chemical agriculture? How can we make this knowledge more accessible and understood by the wider public? What larger role might Maui and Hawai`i take in the global movement against GMO agriculture?What role might Hawai`ian cultural understanding and traditional land stewardship practices have to inform global transformation toward a just, peaceful and ecologically vibrant future?What can be learned from the international indigenous leaders, youth activists, economic and ecological innovators who will be in Paris that can inform our ability to better care for the aina of Maui and Hawai`i?In order to pull this off we will need the support of our community! Our trip in total will cost $30,000. This includes all of our airfare, accommodation, food and registration for events. Your donation istax deductible!

McCOMAS        Give Respect And Compassion to Everyone!In a world that sometimes seems to get more cold and divisive by the day, Grace Katherine McComas was a bright light. Joyful, funny and sweet, Grace was known for her good humor and kind heart. The first to welcome a newcomer, she wasempathetic to the needs of people and other living things. An engaging and articulate teen, Grace was active in music, sports and community service.This video was put together by her father David the week of her death...\\n\\nAt age 14, everything changed for her and her family on a summer evening in June, after a drug-assisted sexual assault, later followed by hateful, malicious and threateningcyber abuse, sexual harassment and bullying. Grace\\'s familyknew what was happening, and tried to get help from multiple public agencies who frankly not only failed to help properly, but have attempted to hide their negligence. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j25Vavsiej4)Grace died by suicide at age 15 on Easter Sunday 2012.     Grace K. McComas Memorial WebpageMaryland\\'s Grace\\'s Law now protects children from         repeated, malicious cyberbullying. For several years, the Howard County Public School System in Maryland refused to mention anything about Grace, including this law or allow any kind of remembrance. Even her school records, detailing the last year of her life were withheld fromher family.While fighting for her child\\'s voice to be heard, Christine McComas met wonderful, determined mothers/advocates who were also being denied truth and transparency from the school system. One of these was Barb Krupiarz, a great champion of the special ed community. After being denied the results of a $300,000 taxpayer funded special ed study (in fact she was told there were no results) shewent to court to have it released, and instead was punished/fined in a retaliatory way- almost $10,000 !(See this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9YxG79Ctks)Christine and Barb both testified at a public hearing in December 2015 in support of a bill to have the Maryland Public Access Ombudsman look into public information denials by the school system since the (now former)Superintendent was hired. Theymet when Christine asked Barbto hold Grace\\'s picture while she testified, well after midnight, and the bill was passed by the Maryland legislature a few months later. The report from the investigation ( www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/OpenGov%20Documents/PAO/Final%20HB%201105%20report.pdf )found serious violations in public information compliance by HCPSS.At the sudden \\'retirement\\' of the former Superintendent,new leadership at the helm of HCPSS has begun righting wrongs, and the first of which is Barb Krupiarz getting her money back.She shocked the McComas family by immediately saying she wanted to put it towards a scholarship to honor and remember Grace!! Truly an unexpected, generous and GRACIOUS kindness to come out of a dark and difficult experience many had trying to bring about truth. GOOD WINS.Barb Krupiarz and Grace\\'s mom Christine met with the Community Foundation of Howard County to learn about how a scholarship is set up and managed.In order to have a scholarship presented in Grace\\'s name every year, the Howard County Community Foundation scholarship fund requires $20,000, plus an initial \"cushion\" to keep the levels above $20K. The McComas familyis adding $5,000 that community members had donated to a memorial fund upon her death, in addition to the $9,300 of Barb\\'s \\'sanction money\\'.We are hoping forcommunity donations of $10,000 to have Grace remembered by a school system who did not help her and to provide scholarships to students who exemplify and encourage kindness.Christine and Barb are also planning to create a nonprofit organization to advocate and educate about G.R.A.C.E. and those issues related to peace, hope and needed social change.Any money donated above the $10,000 will go towards the creation of this organization.Imagine what this world could be if the inherent dignity of each human was respectedand cared for.                  Join Us! and Thank you!Dear friends,  As many of you may already know, our dear friend Mr. Pat Messer and family needs our help. This is a very serious matter. Unfortunantly there has been a horrible fire at their home. Needless to say they have suffered a huge loss. Thankfully everyone is okay. We as his friends and family must act fast and come to the aid of him and his family. If Pat has ever brightened your day by making you laugh or been there for you, I\\'m asking that we all show our love for him and return the favor.  I am asking that all of us (especially C/O 1995 WC graduates) give at least $5.00 to lighten the load and show him that we care. PLEASE remember that time is of the essence so we must act now!LETS GO WARRIORS, WE CAN DO THIS!!!With Love,Andre\\' S. Gilbert SrDear friends,I\\'ve organized this page in honor of my beloved nephew who died tragically in a car accident, July 9th 2016. My nephew had just turned twenty the day before. My nephew was a loving, caring, kind person, and in his honor, my family plans to create a college scholarship for students attending Jake\\'s high school from which he graduated in 2015. This is a horrific and indescribable tragedy for our family. Though we can no longer help Jake, we can in Jake\\'s memory do something to help others. And dear friends, I can assuredly tell you, Jake would love this. In life, Jake was ever the giver. He preferred to give, not receive. And in death, we can continue his legacy. With love and immense gratitude, Jake\\'s family.Dear Friends and Family,Our hearts are heavy at the recent passing of our good friend and colleague, Peter Alzola.The outpouring of support from the community during the past months has been amazing, and the family is eternally grateful for all the love and support. Yet, so many of us want to do more to help the family in this incredibly difficult time. As you know, Peter was a dedicated and loving father and husband and was always involved in his children\\'s lives. His daughter, Gavi, is in 12th grade at Coral Gables High School. Pia is in 11th grade at MAST Academy.Peter\\'s greatest concern was not for himself, but rather for the future of his wife, Beth, and his children. This is especially true, as college is just around the corner for the girls. So, to honor Peter and support the family in a tangible way, we have set up this fund.Sincerely,Peter and Beth\\'s FriendsHello my dear friends! I am asking for your support in helping me evolve my life andbegin tobecome a genuine success! The way I will do that, is through the Landmark Forum Advanced Course. This course will help guide me toward the financial freedom I so desperately desire, andallowme to becomea true powerhouse. It will help me begin living out my dreams of helping the world and all those around me. The course will do that by teaching me the necessary first steps to take toward opening a pre-natal wellness center. This centerwouldprovidehealthcare and support to pregnant women of all ages and backgrounds. The support would include pre-natal yoga classes, pre-natal massage, and courses that educate women about breathing techniques during labor, pre-natal supplements and proper nutrition, as well as breast feeding classes and support groups for new moms.I graduated from a science major for this reason, and since then had a baby of my own. I became strongly awareofthe lack of support and education pregnant womenreceive, especially those who are not in the best financial situation. I amfinallyready to set out to change all that, but I need your help! I understand this is a HUGE dream and vision I have, but I promise you, I will take 1 step a day, no matter how big or small, toward achieving it. I am also aware that I cannot do this completely on my own. Therefore, today I am taking a BIG, vulnerable step, by inviting you to help make this DIFFERENCE with me!So much GRATITUDE in advance! Thank you!Please join me and our staff to help the Ag/Science Academy raise money for our annual field trips. This is a great opportunity for our students to see real world historical, cultural, and scientific sites. It alsotends to beone of themost memorable parts of our program as students are able to apply what they are learning in the classroom to the world outside.The Agricultural-Scientific Academy at Tracy High School functions as a school within a school. The four year program includes an integrated curriculum, career fairs, job shadowing, field trips, and requires students to complete a culminating Senior Project. Topics for past projects have ranged from growing cotton to writing childrens books, and from building a robot to making almond butter. Regardless of our students chosen projects they all finish our program with knowledge and skills necessary to be successful beyond high school. Please help us continue to offer unique real world experiences for our students. Your support is greatly appreciated!In the early morning hours of February 1, 2017, a loving mother, soulmate, sister and friend was taken from us far too soon .  We are devastated for our friend Kris who is heartbroken over losing the love of his life. Virginia Kress always lit up the room wherever she was.  Her laugh was infectious.  She was the most relaxed easy-going person you would ever meet. Kane, her son,  was the light of her life and she was his best friend. She was such a fun loving mother. You would often find her throwing on a jersey to play hockey with Kane which is his favorite sport.  She never liked attention to be brought upon her but I know that she would want to make sure Kane had what he needed in life to achieve his dreams with a proper education.  We will show her that even though she is gone, she will never be forgotten. Kane will always know his mother\\'s love and what she meant to the many people who had the honor of knowing her.  Please help support Kane\\'s  educational fund by donating and sharing her story. Kris and Kane  have a long journey ahead and any support is appreciated. Thank youScenic Hills Christian Academy is a PreK-12 grade private school in San Antonio dedicated to providing a quality, caring educational environment for young people from all around the city.

He was diagnosed with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) in Blast crisisin July 2016. He was immediately hospitalized for 41 days where he underwent chemotherapy. Kens doctors determined that the only chance of survival was through a bone marrow transplant. My daughter, Jessica, was a half match donor, procedure happened on January 4, 2017. However, prior to the transplant Ken suffered several complications that required multiple hospital stays and surgeries. On July 20, 2017 we were told his cancer was back 80% blastic and the doctor\\'s said there was nothing else thay can do for him. He tried an experimental drug and it failed. On August 7, 2017 he started hospice care.Ken faced a year of battling his cancer. He never gave up. He suffered and sacrificed for his family. He is finally at peace now. It was the hardest day of our lives.We still have a very long road ahead of us. Healing, grieving and trying to make sense of this all. My heart aches for my children who lost their father. We have wonderful memories and try to remember all the sacrifices he made for his family and the wonderful memories we shared together.My daughter Jessica who is 18 starts Rutgers College of engineering in the fall at her father\\'s alma mater. My son Andy who is 15 will be a sophomore at Voorhees High School.  We have a new chapter in our lives and it is very scary one. I am now a single parent and it is not what I had planned. God will be with me as well as my family and friends. I am so lucky for all the support during this past year. I can\\'t thank everyone enough.Any donations at this point will be going toward my children\\'s education fund.God Bless Everyone!The Hrabovecky FamilyGloria, Jessica and AndyFamily and Friends:\\n\\n On June 24th of 2011 Robert \"Kapen\" was working at a Young Lifecamp in Williams, AZ. He went to bed feeling fine but when he woke up he felt numbness on his right side. He was at camp with 350 teens and adults and he was the only person that was affected with this virus. He was taken to the emergency hospital in Flagstaff and then things just got worse so He was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix.\\n\\n At the Mayo Clinic he had seizure of some sort and was placed in a medically induced coma. A tracheotomy was performed and he was placed on a ventilator. They ran a gamut of tests and checked for everything they could possibly think of: West Nile Virus, Lyme disease, Valley Fever, and more with no diagnosis.After he came out from the comahe was given 1 % chance of living.He had no feeling from neck down. He had become a quadriplegic, he was mute and could only communicate with his eyes.He stayed at the Mayo Clinic for several weeks thenhe was then transferred on a private jet plane to UCLA Medical Center in West Los Angeles for further research but they also could not find a diagnosis. He stayed there close to two months.After UCLA he was transferred to a sub-acute care facility and there he began moving a little more and his left side started waking up and later transferred to Long Beach Memorial for intense rehab. He was given two months of intensive physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy and then he was sent home after nine months of being in hospitals.\\n\\n There is still no concrete diagnosis and doctors are still baffled as to what attacked Robert\\'s brain. They can only suggest to keep going with therapy.\\n\\n These days Robert has therapy from 9am to 3pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. He is still in a wheelchair, needs special transportation to get to and from therapy. He communicates with his phone because he is unable to speak. He has agastrostomytube because he is not able to swallow and has a caregiver who assists while his mom is at work.\\n\\n This page was set up to bring support to help with medical bills, nursing care, treatments not covered by the insurance,etc. The familywould be so grateful for any kind of support all of us are willing to give.We don\\'t HAVE to reach this goal but if we did it would be a huge blessing to the family.

I\\'m currently in weeks 3 and 4, but need support to complete weeks 1 and 2 in June.  Please support if led and able. Your prayers and continued support is greatly valued.  I\\'m blessed and grateful. Thank you!I\\'ve been a part of the Oneness Community since March 2012. Since then my life has taken on a tremendous transformation through healing, receiving Deeksha, becoming a Blessing Giver, working on myself, clearing up past energies, and communing with others. Since joining Oneness I\\'ve experienced miracles in my life: completely reducing my alcohol consumption, healing relationships with my family, past loves, and more importantly myself. I now view my body as a temple and channel for God/Divine to be utilized for the purpose of Awakening and Connecting with all. At this time, I\\'ve started helping the New Orleans Oneness community expand to nearby communities/cities and have taken on more of a prominent role within the local New Orleans Oneness community. I now experience more peace and bliss. I now have a relationship with the Divine/God. My wish and intention is share this bliss and experience with others across the globe/worldwide. I am a Blessing Giver and the next step is to become a Oneness Trainer. I am seeking $5,000 to help cover the costs of attending the Trainer\\'s course at Oneness University from May 1st to May 12th. The costs helps cover airfare, meals, lodging at the University, transportation while in India, lodging before and after the course, registration, and assistance with expenses to cover while taking unpaid time off from work.I truly hope you are able to donate and give, as the favor will be returned to you by the Divine and through me in anyway that I may assist. I am more than obliged to take pictures, notes, letters, and prayers with me to the Oneness University to be placed on the alter. This is open for anyone if you are able to donate at this time or are able to send Deeksha and prayers in my travels. Many miracles occur and happen through this. I successfully received a medical surgery that took 5 years for approval, after having a written request/prayer on the alter at Oneness University. So many things have occurred and I am grateful. Most significant miracle is I am able to BE.Namaste to All and I hope to greet, meet, and thank you personally on our journeys.

I have been working as an organizer and health specialist for the past 5 years, specifically within the LGBTQIA community.

Start a business that will allow me to curate events of all magnitudes from celebratory, to bridal, or corporate events, fashion, conferences, etc. This business will support the many professional skill sets of not only myself, but folks from the larger LGBTQIQA House Ballroom Community, providing space for further economic development and community sustainability. It is deeply and intrinsically part of my core values to continuously invest in my community that has given me the necessary support and nourishment to be authentically me.I am raising funds to cover the expenses of completing a Fashion Events Planning Certificate at Fashion Institute of Technologys Continuing and Professional Studies Program for Summer and Fall 2017. Thus far, I have completed 2 of the required 12 courses.

Donate, Share, Spread the word to support Trans Futures. With LoveWell, to begin, the root of my problem is that I was not born in the U.S. I was born in Mexico, but I was brought over to the U.S. before I even turned a year old, so I cant really say Ive actually been to Mexico. My parents, who are now divorced are also Mexican, so the topic of getting or having a job has always been quite difficult to talk about. My dad, who Ive stayed with for the last three years, is a self-employed sub-contractor. Although he may not have an actual company, or workers he is responsible for, he has never failed to provide for me, my older brother, and my two younger sisters. When we came to the U.S, we lived in a small apartment in Balch Springs, TX., just twenty minutes outside of Dallas. After living for about two years there, we moved to the house where weve lived for the past fifteen years or so. When I started school at Walter E. Floyd Elementary, I was always one of the kids who seemed to grasp concepts better and faster than others. Throughout third, fourth, and fifth grades, I received Commended on all of my end of year TAKS tests, which was not extremely unique, but very recognizable. Fortunately, in our district, there was a program, Quest, available to students who displayed the same qualities I did at young ages. In this program, which was available to students from third to sixth grade, one designated day a week, a bus would pick up students from each of the elementary schools, and take us to another elementary school, that had a designated section of the school for the classrooms in which we occupied on the days we went. After completing all four years of quest, I moved onto G.T. classes at A.C. New Middle School. G.T. (Gifted and Talented) classes usually had no more than fifteen students in any of the core classes, like English, Math, Social Studies, and Science. Since I was four I played soccer, both recreationally and competitively, but in seventh and eighth grade I made both the basketball and football teams. One of my highest goals when I was in elementary and middle school was to play for my high schools soccer team. My freshmen year at West Mesquite High School, I did finally make the soccer team and it was a dream come true. Academically, in high school, most classes changed from G.T., to AP (Advanced Placement). I did fairly well my freshmen year and received the Lighthouse Recipient Award, chosen by my AP Human Geography teacher. Students were chosen as Lighthouse Recipients because teachers believed they had the potential to become great people and were role models to other students. At the end of my freshmen year, my parents began their divorce, which managed to distract me some during my sophomore and junior years, but not enough to knock off of my path. Along the way in High School, I was named an NSHSS (National Society for High School Scholars) Scholar. My Junior year I finally made my schools Varsity Soccer Team, which was one of my ultimate goals since elementary school. Since I was in middle school, I knew that Texas A&M University was where I would go to study for and become a Mechanical Engineer. During my Junior year in high school, I took an Architecture course, and an Engineering course. Then, during my Senior year, I took a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) course, that actually took place at another building a few miles from my actual high school. This course was extremely fun and educational and helped reinforce my decision to become an Engineer. My Senior year, I also became a teachers assistant for the Engineering course I took my Junior Year. I would like to say that my Senior year in high school was my most successful, considering I graduated in the top 5% of my class of 422, I was named Captain of the Varsity Soccer team, I received the Lighthouse Recipient Award again, from Soccer Coach, and I was awarded a trophy for being named in the First-Team All-District for soccer, and was accepted into the University of my dreams. High school was a great success for me, but now I am moving on to the next stage of my life. I am now 18 and have just started my first week at Texas A&M University. When I attended FISH Camp I was completely taken in awe by how amazingly nice and helpful students are from A&M. This Campus is extremely welcoming and amazing, and I absolutely love it, as well as the students and staff. A few days ago, I received an e-mail, notifying me of how much I will owe for the semester. I was taken a bit by surprise, because I was expecting a little less, but the amount for my first Semester is $4,048.49. I would honestly be more than willing to get a job, but the simple fact that I was not born here and dont have a Social Security Number, doesnt allow me to. Now, I would plan on asking my dad to help me pay for school, but as of now, he is overwhelmed with paying my rent, helping me with everyday expenses, and of course paying all the bills at home, including caring after my two younger sisters at home who are in high school and middle school. My last resort was to take out student loans, but one obstacle I was not prepared for, was lenders telling me that I simply do not qualify for any kind of loans, merely because I am not a citizen. This was something I had not seen coming, and for a moment it swept my feet from under me. For the past few days I have been sad, confused, disheartened, but also motivated. The thing is, if theres one thing I have learned from all the things life has thrown at me in my eighteen years of life, its that theres always a way. Its not always easy to put yourself out there and ask others for help, but I am determined to find a way. One good thing, is that I dont have to pay it all at once. I have the opportunity of paying $1,015.87 by September 9th, so that is my first goal. Whether I reach it or not is not my concern right now. My concern is finding more and more ways to get there, but I will not give up. Some people may read this and not have money to donate, but there is always a prayer you can offer. Prayers offer answers, and answers are also something I am in search of right now. No matter the amount you are willing to donate, it is simply money I did not have before, and it makes me one step closer to reaching my goal. For those of you who have graduated from a college or university already, you should know how essential and beneficial it is to finish school and have a degree. I have worked for this too long and I am in no way, shape or form giving up, and I hope you can help me through the process.\\n#GFMScholarship\\n\\n\\nThank you, and God bless!To whom it may concern, My name is Dwayne Peterkin II. I am preparing to enter my junior year at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I intend on majoring in Communications with a minor in Anthropology. After graduation I have set my sights on establishing a career within in the intelligence community. This encompasses agencies such as the CIA, FBI, and others that aid in maintaining the security of our country. I have also given heavy consideration into developing a career in the field of public relations and marketing. During these undergraduate years I desire to take advantage of the various offerings available at the university. Among these offerings is the opportunity to study abroad. I would ideally like to study abroad during the summer of 2016. This is the reason I am contacting you today. Before delving to deeply into that matter I would like to give you some background information about myself. I was born to a single mother in the inner city of Baltimore, MD. In spite of having a relationship with my father, he has been absent in aiding my mother in financially supporting me. At the age of five I was offered the opportunity to attend a private school, and continued private education for the entirety of my academic career. My mother began to make sacrifices to pay my tuition and allow me to receive the best education possible so that I could succeed in life. This decision set me on the path to where I am today. Among the opportunities afforded to me the most prominent was being able travel to Hawaii and participate in the Student Global Leadership Institute. This program selects a group of students from each school connected with the program. Those chosen come from various countries and are placed in an environment where they learn about and attempt to solve global issues. At the end of the program each school makes a plan and gives a presentation about a project they plan to institute the following academic year at their respective school. The selection process involved writing an essay and also being interviewed by the headmaster of our school and the program liaison employed at our school. My application was submitted to be compared with those of many others in my class. Finally after a period of a few weeks I was notified that I was accepted into the program. This experience helped shape my opinion of the world around me and allowed me to for friendships around the world with others who seek to make an impact on a global scale. It also furthered my desire to study abroad one day after meeting the other students from various countries across the world.  I am contacting you in hopes of sparking your interest in making an investment in my future. As I stated previously I have gone through a process akin to the selection process for the universitys study abroad program. My aspiration to travel abroad is a very tangible goal. My mother has sacrificed quite a lot to get me to this point in my education and asking her to assist in gathering finances so that I can study abroad would be asking far too much. I have chosen to be proactive in my approach to the financial situation at hand. I have devised a plan to approach cover the expenses of this endeavor. However any donation is appreciated.  Sincerely,                     Dwayne Peterkin IIHello Family, Friends & Kind Strangers,My name is Julissa and the beautiful little girl in the picture next to me is Amaris, my seven year olddaughter. I took that picturealmost a year ago as we waited in line hand and hand, ready to walk across the stage ofthe UC Berkeley RAZA Graduation Ceremony. Moments later, I had the privilege of sharingthat stage and that accomplishment with the oneperson I have always sought to make proud-my little human being.I stand before you today, a first-generation, high school and college graduate who weeks ago was accepted to Harvard\\'s Graduate School of Education. Although I am both excited and honored to have this opportunity, I am also overwhelmed by the overall cost of attending HGSE. Tuition alone is $43,280, plus an additional $3,432 in medical fees.The entire projected cost of attending Harvard comes out to a whooping $70,744.00, however this estimate is of that of a single (meaning no dependents) masters students. I am pleased to say that Harvard has awarded me a modest amount of $14,000 to help cover some of the tuition costs, nonetheless that is not nearly enough to cover school fees nor living expenses. So here is where I turn to the kindness of others...As I move forward with my academic endeavors, I realize that my lived experiences as a low-income, first generation, teen mom, student of color that have taught me just as much, if not more, than anything I could have ever learned in the classroom. It is these key experiences that keep me grounded and inform my pedagogical approach to education. Education can, and at times does, function as a liberatory tool of empowerment that enables consciousness; that initial spark. My refusal to accept education as anything less than freedom, encourages me to pursue a life dedicated to education. Moreover, it is the countless mentors, my brothers, and my beautiful daughter that have given me the courage to pursue an advanced degree, starting with my Ed.M. and resulting in a Ph.D.in Education Policy,so that I too can spark the minds that will change this world.As a single mother and the sole financial provider for my daughter, I am starting this campaign in hopes that you can help in making this dream come true for her and I. I am more than happy to share more about my story, or answer anyquestions if it will help shed light on my situation.Thank you for your support in advance!To learn more about our story please follow the links below:Univision-Madre soltera logra sueo de estudiar en Harvard con su hija como inspiracin PEOPLE\\'S Magazine-California Woman Goes from Teen Mom to Harvard: \\'My Motivation Was a Walking and Living Thing\\'Girl Talk Philly was founded in 2008 by LaToya Stroman, a Philadelphia native.

Sharing similar interests and passion for individuals with special needs, our collaboration hit the ground running and we havent looked back since. Through all of our collaboration, I have gotten to know these two phenomenal people very well. They opened their door to us, which in turn opened my heart to them.Owen Hicks is the son of Victoria and Greg Haislip. He is 20 years old and attends Mason Life, a program for individuals with intellectual disabilities at George Mason University. In the fall, Owen will be entering his sophomore year. The program offers college courses, life skills training, and the opportunity for independence. Through this program, Owen is able to live in a dorm with peers and choose from a variety of courses that the college has to offer. It gives students with disabilities the opportunity to participate in the same experiences as their same age peers. Although Mason Life is very beneficial, it is also very expensive. With 3 other children in college, it has become almost impossible for them to come up with the money needed in order to send Owen back to school for his sophomore year. They have come up with $28,000, but are still short $12,000. I have racked my brain in trying to come up with a solution to this and will continue until I find one. I feel that God crossed our paths for specific reasons and I will be forever grateful. Please help me in helping them to reach this goal. Thank you so much for your consideration. Pay it forward. Serve with Passion.Visit this link for a brief insight on Owen and the program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwPuEM_Irr66ZnBmc1NyQkN2NHc/viewPeace & Love Friends & Family,I am excited to share this great news with you. Approximately 2 months ago I told the Universe that I wanted to go to the Mother Land.....Africa.... Soon after, the universe began to set things in motion for me to be able to go. I was invited to attend a FREE Seminar on African History & Civilization. During this seminar it was announced that the people that held the seminar also hosted an annual \"FREE\" trip to Egypt. Well boom! There was my opportunity right there. I attended the orientation and found out more about the program. It is ran by an organization out of Glenside PA called African Genesis.They offer a \"FREE\" trip to Africa by providing opportunities for you to raise your own money to go. However, they have put an entire program together where as I will be volunteering as a Group Leader to help chaperon around 100 children that will also be going to Egypt. Here is the kicker. The program is not only for going to Africa. It is entire learning experience that both the adults & the children must attend. Not only that, both the adults and the children will be required to do history assignments. I will be Learning along with the children and helping them learn at the same time. The entire program is over a two year period and includes going to other African historical trips such as the Underground Railroad Tour, The Slave Route Tour, and the Black Baltimore Tour. Here is what I\\'m required to do as a Group Leader;  \"Group leaders are involved in all aspects of the 27-month program and the trip to Africa. It is the responsibility of the group leaders to regularly communicate with the participating students assigned to them, to answer any questions the students may have about the program and the information being disseminated. They also monitor the students to ensure that they receive all information, attend the bi-monthly classes and complete the monthly book reports and assignments. Group leaders also closely supervise the students on the cultural trips and the sojourn to Africa and must identify any health, educational or emotional special needs of the student. Group leaders are required to participate in leadership training which includes workshops in personal development, critical thinking, cultural awareness, diversity, stress management, team building and communication skills.\"They allow us to pay in increments and the 1st $700 is due by June. So here is what I am asking. I am asking for as many people as possible to support me going to Africa as a Group Leader. If you follow my FB page you know that I am heavily involved in studying our ancient herstory from a metaphysical eye. Imagine if I am actually on the land.... and in touch with the energy of the ancestors. I am positive I will bring back not only knowledge to put on social media but knowledge that I will be putting in a book because that is my ultimate goal. So I am asking for Donations and/or to purchase books of tickets for $12. Here is how the tickets work. There is 3 cash prizes for $1000, $500, & $250. The drawing of the winning ticket is on June 13, 2015 @ 1pm. If you are out of state I will give you your ticket numbers instead of the actual booklet because they will need it in order to verify the winner. I will record the announcement of the numbers. If you are out of state and your number is called you will have to sign a document with African Genesis & then they will send you a check in the mail. If you dont want to buy tickets then you can donate. My birthday is soon, perhaps make it a gift:-). I will also be selling skating tickets as part of the fundraiser amongst other things. Please support one of your favorite people \\n\\nand help me get to the Mother Land so that I can come back and share my experiences with you.Hello everyone,I am prudhvi from fullerton,california. Here i am raising on behalf of my friend CHANDRASEKHAR who lost his father today, chandrasekhar is doing his masters in mechanical engginering at CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FULLERTON, he is in his final semester. He is a very hard worker and personally he is paying all his school fee and all, unfortunately his father has passe away  an hour back, he need to go immediately for his father funeral, his father is a barber in old city, hyderabad. And his mother is a house wife, Back home they were financially poor, people who knows personally about chandrasekhar would know how good person he is, as a friend i am just trying to help him , guys will join our hands together and help him. Any amount is helpful to him and his family.https://www.gofundme.com/8d218g I am humbling myself and Kamilah to ask for help in getting her through dental school. As some of you know Kamilah is my great niece. Her mother and grandmother, my sister, passed away within months of each other when she was a senior in high school. She has always had aspirations of becoming a dentist. She was able to go to Howard University and earn her BS in health science. She was invited to MeHarry Medical School to attend their masters program which was required for entry into Dental School.She is now in dental school.While there she lost her uncle, dad and grandmother within months of each other. Quite frankly I don\\'t know how she has continued to function. Well she is, and is doing quite well in school.She is unable to work due to her course load and is currently living off of student loans. She was in a car accident and her car was totaled. She was not hurt. Her insuranceproceeds are going to help pay off her car with a small balance left. Needless to say she cannot afford another car. Living in Nashville and having to stay at school for all hours of the night, a vehicle is required. She needs good reliable transportation so that she will also be able to drive back home during breaks as flying is too expensive for her budget. Thus I am setting up this gofundme request as a last resort. If ever there was someone to help, she is the person. She is a product of Achieveable Dream Academy and exemplifies that program. Any amount would be helpful. If I could buy her a car I would, but circumstances prevent me from doing so. I amsure Kamilah would rather I not do this as she is a very proud young lady. Likewise I am a very proud person but sometimes you have to set pride aside!Any funds remaining after a vehicle is purchased will be used to help with living expenses while she is in school!Thank you for your support,ChrisI want to thank you all for your support and prayers during my brothers passing on Father\\'s Day. We are trying to raise money to assist in funeral arrangements and the remaining funds will go to his children. Nick wanted to be buried at Riverside National Cemetery. Nick was 28 years old and a father of 3, and one on the way. His baby\\'s don\\'t understand that dad is gone and never coming home. Nick was a Veteran of the United States Marine Corps and served his country. He graduated from ITT with Associates and Bachelors Degree. He loved his kids, family and friends. He wanted to join the military when he graduated high school. He wanted to make his family proud, his grandfather Charles, his uncles Ben and Memo and most importantly his father Joe. They all served in the military, Navy, Army and Marines. He loved to ride his Harley and he loved taking his loved ones on a cruz in the 51 Chevy. He loved everyone, if you meet him you would of loved him too. He loved hanging out with his best friend his father and his cousins. He loved what he did for a living, he loved technology and computers. He took over my fathers business  http://www.e-jmconsulting.comwhen my father was unable to work due to a liver transplant. He has been a computer consultant for several years and loved meeting new people, networking with peers. Nick lost his life in Hemet on Father\\'s Day and every Father\\'s Day will be hard for our family. I want to thank you all for your prayers.I\\'m trying to raise some money to help with some of my sons expenses.His name is Kysen and he\\'s 3 years old. Kysen is on the autism spectrum and he involves a lot of special care and attention due to our deficits in communication. Since having him evaluated I have resigned my position in management at Trader Joes. I cut my work days down to only the weekend so I can spend more time trying to help develop my son. His mom and I spend most of our time and focus on his special needs.Thus me not working as much had put me in a financial hole; not a big one but don\\'t want it getting any more significant. Kysen is in the process of being enrolled in NYCs Special Department of Education.   It\\'s just been hard because I haven\\'t been working that much lately to give my son more attention.  I really need a boost until he starts going to school then I\\'ll be able to work a little more.  Thank you for taking your Time to read a little about my life.Hi friends, I would really appreciate a moment of your time to either send words of encouragement, share this story or help out. I have a former student who is trans. His parents kicked him out of his house 6 months before he graduated high school because his identity did not fit into their narrow religious views. So, they gave up and moved away to open a coffee shop. Yet, Holden is still such an amazingly talented and positive kiddo. Holden had a hard time getting back and forth to school, so he missed several days of his Spring semester, so he had to make up a few classes in summer school. Holden reached out for help and he finished high school yesterday YAY! Holden was also accepted to college to study Urban music in Chicago (he plays guitar)! Despite major setbacks, Holden is doing great things to make sure his life isn\\'t destroyed by his parents selfish choices. We had a small graduation party last night and Dalton gave Holden a custom made guitar for this monumental achievement. I started this go fund me to help Holden pay for travel, tuition, books and anything else he may need to go to school.I am hoping we can get enough support from the community to make sure he can start out his journey without financial duress.So I am hoping you will do one of the above things to help get Holden\\'s story out and to help get him set to go to college. Anything you can do is so greatly appreciated!The most valuable gifts are the most fragile ones- ~  Jennifer Newth Denny~This is the story in the paper scroll down to see why I am moved after just meeting her...

(Pink skies are special to her). I told her how great that was & we both agreed that our favorite color is pink (we love pink). The conversation followed: Hannah: u know the Littlest Petshop house is all pink? Me: cool. Love pink Hannah: well I do love pink, but it is HOT PINK, LIGHT PINK, even FUCHSIA ALL OVER! Don\\'t these people realize there is such a thing as TOO MUCH? Someone should tell them to \"tone it down a bit\"  feeling amused. ...Is taking a break!

Thousands of people my age are thrown head first into a mind-boggling world of heavy financial responsibility when they graduate high school and pursue a secondary education. Having graduated from Chicago\\'s top private high school, I was convinced that my academic achievements would secure my place in a college that would allow me to learn relatively debt-free. As fate would have it, though, I arrived at Whittier College last fall with a staggering bill of around $24,000 in tuition and fees. An obviously insurmountable figure for any one person, I begged and pleaded with the financial aid and business offices to award me more money. Eventually, my bill was reduced to $4600, which, while much more manageable, is still beyond my family and I\\'s ability to earn before the Spring term is set to start on February 2nd. If you have the means to donate to my tuition fund, whether it be a dollar or a few, any amount will ease the burden placed on my family and I. I will make the commitment to repay each and every one of you, financially or otherwise, if you so choose to assist.Help the Russellville Cyclone Band, The Pride of Russellville, march down Pennsylvania Avenue in the 2017 Presidential Inaugural Parade.  We are proud to have received an invitation from Washington D.C. to represent our school, community and state at the 2017 Presidential Inaugural Parade in Washington D.C.  The Russellville Cyclone Band carries a tradition of excellence wherever it performs. During the 1960s and 1970s our band gained national recognition and was invited to march in the 1977 Presidential Inaugural Parade under the direction of H.L. Shepherd.  In 1997, the band was invited to march again under the direction of Travis Beard, and the tradition of marching in a Presidential Inaugural Parade every 20 years was established. Now in 2017, we are proud to have received our third invitation to march in a Presidential Inaugural Parade under the direction of Dewayne Dove. This opportunity and experience is one our kids will remember for a lifetime.  The Russellville Band program has remained true to its founding vision--everyone participates and no one is left on the sidelines. Our band wants to continue to represent our community, our school district, and our state as we are the only band from Arkansas that will be marching in the Inaugural parade. For more information, please contact the Russellville Band Boosters via email at cyclonebandoperationdc@gmail.com.On Thursday August 28, 2014 we lost our dear friend Barry Turner to ALS. Barry was in the comfort of his home with his wife Leanne by his side. He is survived by his wife Leanne, his son Daley, and his daughter Stella. Barrys love for his family, soccer and teaching will be among some of his legacies. Service announcements will be coming soon.In Lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations made the their childrens college fund.Thank you for visiting the Barry Turner Foundation GoFundMe page. We have set up this page to help raise money to send Barry\\'s two children to college. Educationhas always been very important to Barry.Any donation great or small will help Barry\\'s children achieve this dream.Barry Turner, Foothills head coach for the Boys Varsity Soccer Team for 23 years, Hillview High School teacher for 19 years, and SoCal Infinity Director has been diagnosed with ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig\\'s Disease). ALS, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, is an auto immune degenerative disease that attacks the nerves cells of the voluntary muscles eventually leading to paralysis and death. Timeframe for survival ranges from 6 months to 10 years with the average being 2 to 3 years. The disease affects about 1 out of 20,000 people. It is not curable.Here at the Barry Turner Foundation we are striving to raise awareness about ALS as well as help the Turner Family.I am fighting stage iv colon cancer with mets to my abdomen and chest. I am going through aggressive treatment currently. I will fight to be here for my Boys. I\\'m not able to work either currently. I do not like asking for help. I thought doing this might give them a good start for school and possibly college.  I know the amount might seem a lot and I apologize. I appreciate any help and will payback any how I can.They launch our children. We launch their summer making possible what they cannot otherwise afford. Let\\'s do this. Together.Here is how the campaign works. I have been a Culbreth mom for 6 years. When I learned how little our teachers earn compared to those in other states, I decided to start this campaign to give them an added bonus during the holidays and before the end of the year. Every year, as those envelopes get bigger, we have seen teachers cry with gratitude because they can make a much needed home repair, take a loved one out for a celebration, buy their child a bike or pay off a medical bill. As this campaign becomes a tradition, it has contributed to a school community where the teachers genuinely feel valued.The campaign is in my name because if we gave the money to the school or the PTSA, we could not give it directly to the teachers. Once the campaign closes, I will withdraw the funds in my name. Wendy Alfieri and I (and whoever else wants to pitch in!) will divide all the donated money into envelopes, one for each Culbreth employee. Then we insert a note that quotes from donor comments and gives the campaign link so our teachers and staff can read everything we wrote to them. On the \"red carpet\" day during the last week of school, we meet the teachers as they walk in for the day and distribute every dollar we raised directly to our Culbreth Teachers and staff. All the decorations, paper for notices, printing, envelopes etc . . are purchased by Culbreth parents, and do not come from the funds. If you are interested in joining me and other parents as we stuff the envelopes, please let me know. After that happens, our wonderful Police Officer Stan Newsome keeps the envelopes in his safe until distribution day! Everyone who donates will get an email announcing the red carpet morning. I hope you will all join me and so many others in our community for that wonderful morning of celebration!!!!!WhenBenbegan teaching high schoolin 2001, he said he promised himselfthat he would create such an amazing classroom environment for hisstudents, one that would be completely engaging  and one that would provide them with an educational experience like none other. To do this, he put a lot of time and money into turning hisclassroom into this:[Above: A full historical mural adorns the classroom wall.][Above: A view from the classroomdoorway toward \"The Pulpit of Knowledge\".][Above: A view from the front of the room out toward the students\\' desks... andlife-size Warrior statue, functioning guillotine, and Egyptian pharaoh\\'s chair!][Above: A \"Hartnell-Original\" lecture as it appears on the H-MAX, a 15\\' x 15\\' theater-esque screen.][Above: What do you get when you combine ESPN\\'s Sports Center with the American Revolution?Playing various Founding Fathers (and Chris Berman), Benanchors a memorable trip through the Revolution!][Above: If it\\'s your birthday, be ready to see everything that happened on your \"special day\" during Ben\\'s\"This Day in History\"... and receive the prized \"Birthday Pencil\"![Above: Outside Room #135, you can find a visual history of the American Flag with 17 authentic reproductions running the length of the hallway!]----------It took years, but Benwas finally able to createa visually pleasing space, fromthe giant pulpit from where hedelivers hismovie theater-sized sermons/lectures to the gorgeous mural on the classroom wall. To add to the experience, hepurchased historically accurate uniforms to bring hislectures and reenactments to life. For example:[Above: Dressed in Antebellum attire, Benspoke at the City of Westerville\\'s Sesquicentennial Celebration.][Above: A Spartan Hoplite soldier.][Above: Roman General. This is one of Ben\\'s favorite and is an on-set replica of the one worn by Russell Crowe in the movie \"Gladiator\".][Above: Ben\\'s9/11 Heroes tribute - and a VERY powerful 9/11 presentation every year.][Above: Medieval Knights Templar... all 75 lbs of it!][Above: The feared \"Redbeard\" of the 18th Century!]----------Benuses theseuniformsto createauthenticand hands-on educational experiences for hisstudents, including his\"Tar and Feather Day\" (where his classesuse syrup and feathers to protest taxes), his\"Civil War Battle Reenactment\" (where his studentsuse over 3,000 water balloons, cannons,horses,and Civil War reenactors to simulate a battle), and his\"Presidential Fight Club\" (where 32 of our nation\\'s Commander-in-Chiefs go toe-to-toe to answer\"Who\\'s #1?\" and take home an actual boxing trophy!).[Above: \"Tar & Feather Day\"][Above:Union soldiersabsorb a\"direct hit\".][Above: Reenactors provide a real sense of panic and chaos for my battle simulation.][Above: The Confederates hold the line during a volley of balloons from the Union soldiers.][Above: The \"Presidential Fight Club\"... the best way to get students excited about American Presidents. Plus, the winners take home a trophy!]----------As Bengets ready to begin his15th year teaching in the fall, he would like to replace classroom equipment that has begun to break down due to wear and tear, as well as purchase new uniforms and accessories that, too, have grown old over time. For instance  when hewears in the 75lbs of chainmail, hebrings in a spare set for the students to try on. The same goes for other uniforms that heprovide students so they get to feel and see history. Hefrequentlyloans hisprops and uniforms to fellow teachers for use in their own classrooms. This has expedited the uniforms\\' deterioration.In 2012, Benturned 35 and promptly announced hiscandidacy for U.S. President. Benused hisactual campaign as a way to teach hisstudents about the issues by having them discuss and debate what hisvarying platforms should be. To carry out thiscampaign, his studentsmade shirts, yard signs, and websites. And while hedidnt win (bummer, right?), he did receive 34 votes - which floored the students! The success of this approach to hands-on teaching has Ben and theSparty Partygearing up to run again in 2016. The students already have a website set up in anticipation:  www.electthebeard.com[Above: In 2016... Elect the Beard!]It has been Ben\\'sexperience that hisclassroom provides students with an amazing educational experience  but, more importantly, a safe-space where their troubles can be set aside for the 45-minute class period. Benturns history into a series of daily stories in order to show students how their own \"stories\" are important and how they are writing their own history every day.Benhasgrandiose visions of adding new uniforms and outfits to the mix, as well as continuing (and creating new) larger-than-lifeactivities.In short, everything hedoes, creates, and wears in, hedoes for hisstudents andin hisneverendingpursuit ofmaking history come\"alive\".Students of all walks of life can (and do) benefit from this kind of approach. Students that are visual learners, students that are hands-on learners, students that are English Language Learners, students that require Special Education services, and students that need that little extra kick of motivation flourish in Ben\\'s classroom. This, in turn, produces students that are excited about education and creates a wonderful atmosphere not only in Room #135, but around the high school and community.However, after 15 years, wehave run out of the personal funds to continue running Ben\\'sclassroom at such an interactive level. To date, wehave spent $68,277 of ourownmoney on hisclassroom and students. In fact, just the other night, Ben spent $80 getting this year\\'s Presidential Fight Club Championship trophies crafted and ordered. Small amounts here and there to \"spice up\" a lecture or to add something special to a student\\'s day (like spending $50 each year buying birthday pencils for his students), or paying yearly to keep the domain name on his classroom websites... it all adds up. And while every teacher spends money out-of-pocket, Ben has certainly gone well beyond basic expenditures. As such, we simply lackthe financial means anymore (and never really could afford these purchases) and kindly ask for contributionsto allow Bento continue to provide future generations with the same kindof experience that past students were able to enjoy. The cost of supplies and materials to replace and repair items in the classroom that Benbrought in or created are, understandably, not covered by the school/district.The funds generated will 100% be used for Ben\\'s classroom and school and will, in NO way, be used for any private items outside of Westerville North High School. The items purchased for his classroom will all be available for the community to view (and passed on to future teachers when Ben retires as they will be community/school/district property) and documented byreceipts and/or Purchase Orders. This money will also NOT be keptin our personal banking account; rather, it will be placed in a school/district account from which Ben will be able to withdraw (and document) any and all purchases.To read more about Ben\\'sclassroom and hisapproach to education, as well as to see additional pictures of the classroom itself and manyof his currentuniforms and activities, please visit  www.drhartnell.com. For those of you who remember Ben\\'s history and holiday \"packets\" (Lord knows I remember watching him work on those things!), he has started to \"go green\". In 2012, he launched  www.nuttyhistory.comas his ownon-line textbook, free for his students(and anyone else in the world). Since 2012, and over the course of the next few years, Ben\\'s goal is to complete the site with all of the packets he used to spend hours xeroxing and distributing to his students.

       "  'Danielle El-Jor is one of the most caring, giving , and sweetest people I have ever met. At the young age of 19 Danielle was diagnosed with stage 3 Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma. After a year long battle she overcame her illness and was considered in remission. Up until about two weeks ago Danielle was living her dream. She was given the opportunity to sing on stage with Garth Brooks at the Richmond Coliseum and since then has been able to write her own music and has already released her first cd. After her most recent scan the doctor found new signs of what could possibly be cancer. Unfortunately it is and it\\'s back as stage 3 lymphoma. Her treatments are set to begin on march 20th and this time they will be more aggressive than last time. I am creating this page to hopefully give back to someone who has given in more ways than you can count and has never asked for a thing in return. Let\\'s come together and help this super woman beat this thing once and for all!!Even though it\\'s easy to paint a pretty picture for social media, It seems like we are all fighting some kind of battle. Please take a moment to read the story of my husband Greg and his battle with Multiple Sclerosis. The last few years have been quite challenging to say the least. We have gone through the process of a variety of treatments in order to curb Greg\\'s rapid decline in health and mobility, but sadly even with the help of pharmaceuticals and western medicine, Greg still suffers frequent flare ups and has lost a significant amount of strength in both legs. MS is both a physically and emotionally draining disease, not only for the person with the disease but for their support system as well. Greg is a relentless fighter and one of the strongest people I know, and we are so ready to fight this disease with the HSCT treatment. Unfortunately none of the cost is covered by insurance, but we are extremely grateful to all of you for your love, support and generous contributions as we conquer this MS beast. Anything you can give (big donations, small donations, prayers, positive vibes, information, etc) is greatly appreciated. Please help spread the word, keep us in your thoughts, and remember to take care of each other. Thank you and God Bless.#FrielStrongYoni is our older brother and biggest inspiration, and he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer a few days ago. Yoni has had symptoms for about a year, but the doctors refused to perform a colonoscopy because Yoni was so young and healthy. The doctors finally agreed to do the procedure on Monday, and found a large tumor in his colon. Yoni is 29 years old, and his doctor told him that he has a 20%chance of living out the next 5 years. Yoni is the most amazing person we know. He has a kind a loving heart. When he was younger, he decided that he wanted to become a dentistso that he could help people who otherwise could not afford treatment. He worked his way through school, and graduated from dental school a little over a year ago. He has already changed dozens of people\\'s lives for the better. Yoni makes everyone around him smile with his sense of humor and positive attitude. He does everything he can to help other people. The world is a better place with Yoni in it.  Yoni has insurance, but his insurance does not cover all of the costs of treatment. He is drowning in student debt, and struggles to pay off his normal expenses as is. Even though he really needs your help,he would never ask for it because Yoni has always put other people\\'s needs before his own. Please help our family. We are so scared, and do not want the cost of treatment to bethe reason the world loses an amazing human being. We could never forgive ourselves if we didn\\'t at least try to help him.Anyamount you can givehelps. Your contribution will forever be remembered, and we will forever be grateful. We will use the funds to make sure Yoni gets the best treatment possible. It will help us pay for his copayments, deductible, and medications.

He has a long road ahead of him, but with your help, we know he can win this battle.((Update #1))1/16/2016Dearest Friends, Thank you so much for your continued support. We cannot express to you how much this means to Yoni, and to our entire family. Your love has brought us so much hope, and has brightened up this otherwise dark time. An update: Yoni had consultations at separate hospitals today to discuss his treatment options. Yoni is a fighter, and his treatment is going to be very aggressive. We will keep you updated on his progress as information comes out. Lets keep the momentum going so that Yoni can make the best medical choices during every step of his grueling journey! Please keep him in your prayers, and send positivity his way!PS. This page was made by one of the many people who loves Yoni. It sums Yoni up really well: http://imgur.com/a/ql8EtFamily, chosen family, friends...In the last week our incredible friend Eric L. Summers was admitted into the hospital with Cancer- multiple myeloma. I saw him a few days ago and he was his vibrant, shady, loving self but it seems its taken a turn since then. He started chemotherapy which of course has drained his body. Pneumonia hit this past weekend, his white cells have depleted and his breathing has become labored. Thankfully, the hard work of his loving doctors have proved to be aiding in his healing process. The pneumonia has become less severe, Eric has been able to acknowledge his family in his hospital room, and will hopefully begin receiving visitors again soon. He has incredible doctors by his side and even better his mom and brothers. Now he needs us.He\\'s taken a leave from Kinky Boots, his mom has taken a leave from her job and her every day life in St. Louis, and one of his brothers is moving to NY from STL after Eric leaves the hospital to aid in his care full time. This is a huge financial burden. Rent, food for him and his family, transportation to and from hospital and rehab appointments, his gorgeous dog (Niko), and of course all the medical bills. I know he is loved by so many of you and if you could make even the smallest donation it would help tremendously. If theres one thing I know about this man is if someone needed your back he would be the first one there.There are a few wonderful people that will be updating all of you with his recovery, but we will keep most, if not all updates, directly from his mother. We are all sending so much love, energy and prayer his way.Four-year-old Mia-Skye Baldouehad to undergo surgery Sunday night after the car in which she was travelling collided with another vehicle in Linstead, St Catherine (Jamaica).Mia is now in intensive care at the Bustamante Hospital for Children after doctors removed a piece of her skull to reduce the swelling of her bruised and swollen brain.We are the family of Mia-Skye (meemz, me me), a bright and loving intelligent baby girl.

My son Anthony was about 8 months old when he started showing weakness and no strength in thecore of his neckor back. Sitting up was a huge task and he didn\\'t portray normal activitiesthat toddlers accomplish through thestepping stones of life. I always wondered why Anthony never asked for myhelp orwhy he neverreally cried. He was the son anymom would wish for and that anyone wouldsay \"parenting is so easy!\" Hewasso good, with a passive behavior and so alert with a smile that would light up the room. As an educator, I knew in my heart something was wrong whenhe never crawled, when he played in his own world and when he would just point at objects that he wanted. I used my intuition and hadhim tested butafter two denials of services, I didn\\'t give up. I couldn\\'t pinpoint what was happening, but at18 months he was diagnosed with autism and wasgranted ABA, Speech, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy to help him with all his needs. As he grew he became stronger and more articulate, but I still felt there was a disconnect. Anthony tip toedwhen he walked or ran,he couldn\\'t lift himself up without help or grabbing on to thingsand hewasunable towalk up and down the stairs without holding on to the railing or crawling up and down. As he ate, he had to be fed because he was unable to hold a fork or spoon to feed himself. In addition, he was unable to drink from a cup without choking and was never able to drink without a straw. Anthony\\'s body had no definition on his arms, legs andface. He stayed so young looking with no maturity to his face or tone to his body andstill no strength. He didn\\'t gain weight or grow like other children his age.With so many signs and no answers I wasalways searching for answersbutIknew there was a missing link. Then the day camewhen the pieces of the puzzle started to form.Theperfect day on April 23,2016 became a nightmare! All day, my son was playing and full of life riding his bike and playing outside. That night my son started to look as if he was having a bad spasm and suddenly his whole body was jerking and his head went back gulping for air and turning completely blue. All I thought about was whyis this happening to my baby?As he was gasping for a breathe, all I could do was turn him to his side and wonder what was happening?? Through the screaming of fear , I watchedhis eyes rolling back and all Icould do was pray that my son would breathe and that he wasn\\'t losing oxygen to his brain. The fear I felt in 3.5 minutes felt like an eternity. When the jerking of his body finally stopped and his body began to relax, all I can see was a blank \"deer like\" stare and he wasnon -responsive. All I can say through my tears was \"Anthony can you hear me?\" but all he did was look through me. As hecame out of the frozen stare and began to cry, I held my baby so tight ,rocked him and told him \"it was going to be OK\". Unfortunately, the seizures continued and my nightmare was progressively getting worse. As the EMS arrived, he continued to have another seizure. The cluster of seizures occurred every 15-20 minutes. While traveling in the ambulance, he was crying saying \"I want to go home\"; I\\'m tired,\" but as we approached the emergency room my son was so weak and non- responsive. As we met with a team of doctors, they reassured us that the medicine being administered would calm his brain from seizing. After a battery of tests which monitored his brain for three days, he would now be medicated on seizure medicine(Keppra) for life.The seizures continued a week later with the same pattern and my son was turning blue and his chest was contracting with no air . The minutes passed watching and hoping they would end .Post- ictal set in which is an altered state of consciousness thatlasted with no response from my son for 15 minutes! There was no communication with a trance like stare as we waited for help.This continued for months until we got answers as to why the seizures were taking place.Also in searching for why Anthonywas so weak, genetic testing was ordered to help us understand why my son was deteriorating.\\n\\nAnthony, mylovable 5 -year- old, was diagnosed with a RARE INCURABLEgenetic disorder called MELAS which is a form of Mitochondrial Disease. Anthony wants to be a typical boy his age but he has always had struggles through the years with language, muscle tone and his lack of energy. Always searching for answers, I knew there was a missing link. This rare metabolic disease is robbingAnthony of the energy his body needs to function.The Powerhouse ofAnthony\\'sdaily life has been affected. Simple everyday tasks such as playing, eating, digesting, walking, running ,drawing or even writing are difficult activites for him.Anthony\\'s daily life has been compromised in so many ways. He is a weak boy who struggles with everyday routines. His coordination is lacking which leads him to have no balance therefore he is unable to jump, run and go up and down the stairs. His energy level is depleted quickly during ANYdaily activity such as eating, playing and exercising which forces him to sleep. A prolonged rest period allows for his energy to refueland for cell recovery. The importance of drinking and maintaining a certain amount of calories per day is a neccessity so that his body does not become stressed causing seizures. Anthony washospitalized due to uncontrallable seizures and weakness due to this horrible disease. Due to his lack of daily calorie intake, Anthony hadsurgery to get aGIFEEDING TUBE. The tube willgive him all the nutrients he needs to mainatin his daily nutritional value. Anthony\\'sphysiological stress on his body causes him not to be able to regulate his own body temperature. He does not sweat, however when he feels hot he seems to \"wilt\" and needs to be placed in a cooler environment and drink constantly to regain his energy levels. This disease kills more children every year than ALL childhood cancers combined.This incurable disease has NOcurrent or proven treatment for a cure. Although there is no medicine for this disease, specialists have placed him on a non- insured research based vitamin cocktail and Arginine that costs $700.00 a month. In addition, the cost for the feeding tube supplies will be $450.00 a month. This is a financial burden on Anthony\\'s family.  Due to a minimal amountof doctorswho specialize in this disease, the insurance companies DO NOT cover MOSTmedical expenses or research basedmedications. Therefore, all expenses are out of pocket and we need your HELP for a very special boy who has touched the lives of his family and friends in so many ways. Please help us give Anthony the ability to slow down his disease and the freedom to make wonderful childhood memories.---------------------------------------------------------------------Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondrial disease result from failures of the mitochondria. When mitochondria fail, less and less energy is generated within the cells. The specialized organelles that act like a digestive system which takes in nutrients, breaks them down, and creates energy molecules for the cell. Mitochondria are responsible for creating more than 90% of the energy needed by the body to sustain life and support growth. Diseases of the mitochondria appear to cause the most damage to cells of the brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscles, kidney and the endocrine and respiratory systems because these systems require a great deal of energy. This metabolic disease will compromise and has changed Anthony\\'s way of life.*** My name is Jodi Macaluso, I am the campaign organizer for Danielle Capece. I am managing the campaign for her and for my godson Anthony.***If you have ever met Sean Harrison then you know he is one of the most genuine people in this world taking each day on with a smile and positive attitude. It is the same positive attitude that he continues to have as he pushes himself each day in rehab after being involved in an accident on the Jackie Robinson when a tree fell and crushed the car Sean and his mom were in.After the accident on July 16, Sean was admitted to the ICU and underwent surgery to stabilize his spine. He is currently paralyzed from the chest down and in a spinal rehabilitation center where he spends about 3 hrs each day in physical and occupational therapy. The road ahead for Sean is long and unknown but also full of physical, emotional and financial burdens. The support for Sean and his family has been incredible and we are hoping that this GoFundMe account is a way for friends, family and others to show their love and support for Sean and the Harrison\\'s. No donation is too small. Together we can provide tremendous financial relief for Sean and his family. Thank you for your donation and all your support for Sean. #HarrisonStrong#SeanStrongHoping we can make Dad\\'s (\"Action\" Jackson Bradley) dream of having little place \"on the farm\". He was diagnosed with stage four adenocarcinoma lung cancer which metastasized to his brain, after having a seizure on the job site back in September. He had complications with a biopsy, pneumonia, and a chest tube forcing him into the hospital for over a month. Through it all he kept his smile, sense of humor, and beams love wherever he is. \\nDad was forced to retire but social security still hasn\\'t caught up from September. \\nBefore that day he and Sharon had been working to keep the bills paid and put a little aside to ready the homestead. They had managed to get the septic, well, electric at the road, and leveling for foundation before he got sick. \\nHe was moved to hospice on Monday.... yet today he mustered the strength to sit outside a few minutes and point at where to dig trenches. Alex finished digging, but we have come to a standstill due to budget. \\nSo many have asked how to help. If funds are tight as they are for so many at this time of year, please share. I\\'m hoping enough people that Dad\\'s positive spirit has touched will see this and help us rally to support and give him a Christmas Miracle... his home on the farm. #TakeActionToTheFarmHello,My name is Alex and that is a photo of my mom, Hyang Sook Hwang. I love her. Everyone loves her. My brother, my dad, her church, people she does not even know all love her. Even though her English is not that great, she is able to speak so much kindness with her hands, her smile, her love and her amazing cooking.So it breaks my heart to say that she is battling stomach cancer. To get up to date, please see my facebook posts firsthere,then hereand finally here . Currently, she is at Samsung Hospital, South Korea after a successful surgery that removedthe cancer (along with 2/3 of her stomach). The recovery has beenpainful but she is MAMA HWANG (and doing very well). However, the cancer has advanced locally to her lymph nodes. My dad, who has been by her side constantly with very little rest and a husband\\'s heart that has encouraged us all, will be meeting with the doctors this comingThursday(6/30) or Friday (7/1) to dicuss chemotherapy in Korea as that is what my mother wants to do.This GoFundMe is primarily in response to the overwhelming words and outpouring from my friends and facebook community. Since we decided to forego the US health care system, all of my mother\\'s hospital bills are out-of-pocket. Her admission to Samsung Hospital, all the scans, her successfull surgery and her current recovery will cost $13,000.My brother, my dad and myself are doing all that we can (with the amazing help of her church, LA UnitedChurch) but we hope that you can help us.There has already been so much support - emotionally, spiritually and financially. My mom has truly made her mark on so many people\\'s lives. It is tough to hear but it is really times like these that remind us of the people we do have in our lives and to cherish every moment, every breath.I really hope that for her next birthday, there will be as many of you as possible with my brother Paul helping her blow out the candles.with love,Alex, Paul and Michael HwangWe are tryin to raise money to help pay for Thomas\\' medical bills and fill in the gap from being unable to work the past few days and days to come for upcomming doctors appointments.On Thursday August 4th i recieved contact from our babysitter while at work that Thomas fell back while sitting on our hard wood floor and hit his head. I asked her if he was ok and she didnt think so. I told her to call 911. She did. They got there about 15 min after the incident happened. My husband and I left work and went to the hospital to be with our 8 month old baby boy. The doctor at the Ionia hospital advised us that he had a concussion and needed test. They did a head and neck ct scan. The doctor came in with the terrible news.....my little baby had 3 skull fractures. He advised us that our baby needed to be transfered to another hospital. He also said that it wasnt medically possible for him to get this major head trama from falling back from the sitting position and that he had to report this to the authorities. He said they needed to do a full body ct to check for other injuries. He came back with those results and it appeared that his ribs were broken. The ambulance then showed up and took us to the Helen Devos Childrens Hospital in grand rapids mi. Upon arriving here they wanted a pediatric radiologist to review the scans. They did blood work and full body xrays. After waiting for what seemed to be forever the neurosurgeon came in to explain the injuries. She told us that he had 3 skull fractures one of which is a depression fracture meaning it is caving in towards my babies brain. She told me my baby needed to stay the night and would need to meet with different doctors tomorrow. I stayed the night with him. My husband didnt.....he had to work the next day in order to support our family. The doctor advised us that these fractures didnt happen from the story the babysitter was giving. Then the really tough news came. She told me the broken ribs are conserning as well because they are almost healed....meaning they didnt happen at the same time. That being said we were now under investigation. Our family felt heartbroken. How could someone hurt our baby...our sweet baby. I stayed with Thomas and the hospital appointed suppervisor. The next day came and we meet with TONS of people regarding our sons health and the investigation as to how he obtained the head wounds, the older broken ribs, and a newly discovered leg fracture. My husband went to work that day (friday, aug 5) but cps, cpc, and the detective had questions for him so he had to leave right away. This day our son met with nurosurgery again they said he was doing great and that as of right now he wouldnt need surgery. They gave us a list of stuff to watch for. He met with physical, occupational, and speech therapy. They said he would need multiple outpatient follow ups becsuse he wasnt moving his extremities equally. He met with the orthopedic limbs specialist about his broken leg. They said he needs follow up scan in 12 days to determin what to do. During all of this my husband and i were told that we couldnt take our babies home...either of them. Cps placed our older son with a family member and he had to have a full abuse work up done. We were told that Thomas would be discharged as long as his pending eye exam was good. We waited the rest of the day for the eye doctor to come. My husband left to pack up things for our boys to have while staying at my sis inlaws house. Around 4:35 on friday august 5th i recieved a call from cps. He told me that we could take our boys home and that our babysitter had just admitted to THROWING my son......my precious 8 MONTH OLD BABY!!! She THREW him. I was outraged. I told my husband the horrific news. He brought our older son in for his abuse testing. Thankfuly nothing was wrong with him. The eye dr came in about 9pm on friday. He did his test and they came back good. We thought that was it....we were released to go home. We got home late that night. The next morning we woke Thomas up about 8:30 becsuse he was still asleep. He drank his bottle and then about 9 am dad fed him his breakfast. In the middle of eating he did something strange.....he zoned out. We waved our hands, clapped, nothing got his attention. We thought mabey he was out of it from just being tired. Then around 4pm we were at our neighbors house and our neighbor was making faces at him and he was smiling and talking and then he just suddendly passed out. He was like a rag doll. When he came to he was in that zoned state again. We brought him back to Devos. They did a ct scan again. They discovered that he now has a brain bleed. Our sweet baby also started having abnormal eye movement. The neurosurgeon decided to admit him and start seizure meds. So thats where were at now. Our son Thomas, my husband, and myself are at the hospital. The plan for now is in a few hours he will have an EEG to monitor for seizure activity and an mri to check the brain bleed. We are praying those test come back well. Please pray for our sweet baby and our entire family. If you are able to leave a donation it would be appreciated soo much. If not a prayer for our family would be amazing.Adam Wohlstattar has been a childhoodeducator for 15 years in the northern Los Angeles area (specifically Ventura County); the last 6 years as Assistant Principal for amiddle schoolin Simi Valley. As a vibrant, successful 38 year-old who is married to a wonderful woman, Brinden (also an educator), and father to Greyson, an amazing 3 1/2 year old boy, Adam appears to have it all.But on June 10th, 2014, his world changed when he was diagnosed with an extremely rare, genetic neurodegenerative disease that currently has a fatal life expectancy of 6-10 years upon diagnosis: Prion Disease.\"Prion Disease?\" you may ask...Exactly.Most of us have never even heard the term \"prion.\"Our mission in this campaign is twofold: First and foremost,to help support Adam andBrinden with their medical expenses and travel costs to see research and medical specialists at University of California San Francisco Memory &Aging Center(UCSF), while simultaneously raising money and awareness of this disease that is grossly underfunded and relatively unknown, despite itsdevastating effects. Justfour months after his official diagnosis, Adam had to step down from his administrative education career and is currently on medical leavefor the remainder of the school year, so hemay focus on staying well and spending as much time as possible with his family.Saying goodbye to his staff and students was one of the hardest things he\\'s ever had to do, but maintaining his health and spending as much time as he can with Greyson and Brinden are his highest priorities.So what exactly is Prion Disease?A link to a website offering more scientific definitions and details will be provided at the bottom of this page, but to summarize in basic terms: we all have Prion proteins in our brains - when they transform into abnormal Prion proteins, symptoms similar to dementia begin to develop. Some cases are sporadic, but in Adam\\'s case, it has been caused by a genetic mutation. Adam currently has difficulties with his speech, handwriting, coordination, judgment and memory. Adam\\'s father passed away at the age of 47, whenAdam was young - he\\'s just learned that his father suffered from genetic Prion Disease, as well as his two half-brothers, who also passed away in their early life due to exact same diagnosis (one at 38 years of age and one at 43). Adam learned of this information upon his initial visit to UCSF last May, where he underwent two days of medical testing and blood work that confirmed the genetic mutation from the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center. Offspring have a 50% chance of obtaining this disease, so Adam and Brindenare very passionate aboutraisingawareness not only for Adam, but also forGreyson should it be passed to him. This beautiful family has more strength, hope, faith and love than most people ever experience; it pullsthem through this trying and terrifying time in their life. Though fearful, they won\\'t allow the fear to overtake the hope and optimism they have for a cure. Your donation will help support Adam\\'s current medical treatments and necessary travels to see specialists (of which there are very few in the country with the depth of knowledge for this rare genetic disorder), help their family with financial obligations while he is unable to work and also help fund research so that one day there will be viabletreatments, improved life expectancy and ultimately, a cure. There is much optimism in this field of medicine but greater awareness and more funding are vital. Thank you.For more information on Piron Disease, click here: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/cjd/detail_cjd.htm#264223058Note: this GoFundMe page was created by a friend of the family with permission. 100% of the donations here will go directly to the Wohlstattars and to fund Prion research(less the mandated fees by this GoFundMe.com).Many of us know John as this lively young man with the dark sunglasses and a bright smile. He is an athletic, 13 year old who loves baseball. But what many of us didn\\'t know was that he was very sick. Last Thursday he had a chest x-ray done which revealed a large mass covering his heart. The doctors were very alarmed at this and decided that they needed to complete a CT scan to get more information. The CT scan revealed that John was more sick than any of us could\\'ve imagined. They initially diagnosed John with Hodgkin\\'s Lymphoma. John, along with his parents, Mike and Cyndi, we\\'re absolutely paralyzed with fear at this news. John returned home and was asked to wait until the following week to have more tests done. However, on Sunday, Mike and Cyndi noticed his health deteriorating and rushed him to the emergency room at Loma Linda Hospital. Luckily they were able to get him admitted right away and start the testing immediately.Monday, May 15, John went through a rigorous line of testing and prodding, to which he handled every step like a TRUE CHAMPION. A spinal tap revealed that John had a rare form of leukemia (ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA T-ALL) . The best way to deal with the leukemia was to start an immediate regimen of chemo therapy. Even with more answers than what they had the week before, Mike, Cyndi and John were still fearful of what lay ahead. The biggest fear was that the cancer may have possibly spread to his brain. Last evening, John completed his first session of chemo therapy. And according to his doctors today, May 16, his white blood cell count has dropped in half, this is great news. Also great news was that they revealed that the cancer had not spread to his brain. Right now John is still in the hospital with a long fight ahead of him. He remains at Loma Linda Hospital with his parents by his side. We all know John is this little guy with a huge heart and a lot of fight in him. John, Mike and Cyndi appreciate all the positive thoughts and prayers that everyone has given. They ask that we all continue to raise them up in prayer and keep John moving strong on the road to recovery.This is my dad Lance. On Fathers Day June 15th 2014, a few hours before my sister Emma and I were supposed to take him out for dinner and a movie, he called to tell me he was at the hospital. He said he was having a follow up on a swollen lymphnode in his thigh that had been bothering him for a couple of weeks. While checking him in, the nurse discovered his lung didn\\'t sound right. She then ordered a chest xray immediately. The xray came back and his entire left lung was opaque. His lung was filled to the brim with fluid, and it had pushed his heart over into the other side of his chest. A cat scan was ordered and everything after that seemed to happen very quickly. I\\'ve never experienced anything quite like sitting in a room with someone you love more than the World and having a doctor tell you his body is full of cancer. Its pretty Earth shattering, to say the least. You feel like the wind has been knocked out of you and you hope that at any moment you will wake up from this nightmare. Only you don\\'t. We were whisked away to a room where we spent the next week. After several biopsies, a surgery, 10 lbs of fluid drained from his lung, and what seemed like endless poking and prodding, the doctors diagnosed him with stage 4 non-hodgkins follicular lymphoma. He started on chemo just 5 days after going in for a check up. His prognosis is good, however the medical bills are not.\\nChances are you probably know Lance. Sometimes it seems like everyone does. He was born and raised in Seattle and began photographing the local music scene at the age of 13.Earning a reputation with his energetic and honest photographs, Lance got involved in some of the most legendary musical movements Seattle had to offer, including working as the official photographer for Pearl Jam in the 1990s. His work can be found in some of your favorite albums, in museums and galleries around the country, and in any music publicationyou can think of. In the 2000s he took some time off from photography to travel the world with his own band, Seattle punk spectacular The Briefs. And in recent years he has spent time engrossed in a wide array of projects from curating installations for Nordstrom to traveling to Nepal anddocumenting the grass roots Sherpa cultural identity for their2012 Spring catalog Sherpa Adventure Gear.Lance has been in recovery for over 10 years and one of his greatest passions in life is extending the hand of service to help others in need. He has worked cloesly with the MusiCares foundation to assist other artists struggling with addiction. He\\'s helped countless individuals on the road to recovery and he is always there. Whether its to offer a place to stay, a ride, an ear to listen, or advice. Now its time for us to be there for him.Lance is not the type to ask for help, so we are asking for him. And like many artists, who have dedicated their lives to a creative calling, he is without insurance. Cancer sucks enough but not being able to afford the treatment sucks worse. Lets help take one thing off his plate so he can focus on kicking some lymphoma ass.Ifyou have anything to give, it will help, I promise.Thanks and love to you all!*Due to the OVERWHELMING support and those who have expressed interest in contributing in the coming weeks we have opened our goal to allow additional donations.

At age 13 the diagnosis became clearer. She had SCID, Severe Combined Immune Deficiency. She had no T cells, no B cells, but she had T cell function. Savannah has spent her whole life in and out of hospitals and doctors offices. She has had to give herself weekly infusions, even twice a week for quite some time. Through it all she became an accomplished dancer, playing Clara in the Community Nutcracker and more importantly made straight A\\'s all through school. It paid off when she graduated Valdectorian from Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. Through all of her medical issues Van (as we all call her) had one dream. It was to return to Duke where she was first diagnosed.  Savannah was accepted to Duke University to study pre-med and to eventually become a pediatric immunologist, treating children much like herself. Savannah has been at Duke for two years. Recently she began to be ill quite often. Her amazing physician rana test only to give us the bad news. Van\\'s T-cell function has crashed. She must have a bone marrow transplant. It is not optional. Van is going to need the love, support, and care taking of her two moms Michelle, and Jill - who are teachers and two sisters Stella and Sofia. Her family lives in St. Augustine, Florida and the procedure will be done in Durham, NC. In order for the family to be with Savannah they will need to secure a place to stay, travel back and forth to Florida with her sisters, her mom has to go on family medical leave for 3 months where she will not receive a paycheck, they must continue to pay for health insurance, car payments, auto insurance, hospital bills, doctors co-pays, medicines, groceriesetc.Savannah is in the fight of her life. Her doctor referred to it as going to war. She will have to endure strong chemotherapy and then the transplant. She will be in isolation where her family will not be able to touch, hug, and kiss her for three months. However, this family is ready to fight, and so is Savannah. They are focused on what lies at the other end. A healthy Savannah. We are so appreciative of anything anyone can do to help us get through this time. We also appreciate your prayers and good wishes!

Neuroendocrine cancer is an uncommon cancer with approximately 1,000 new cases per year and account for only 3% of pancreatic cancers. What is even more rare, is a person in my excellent health and young age battling this. Unfortunately, the stage of pancreatic cancer I have been faced with is so advanced that my best option is chemotherapy. Despite years of research for metastatic pancreatic cancer there is no cure. Nonetheless, many patients have had dramatic and durable benefits from chemotherapy. It is going to take a fight to help me and a fight I am ready for. It is going to take some serious help from not only my immediate support team but also anyone willing to help me beat the odds. At this moment Stanford has suggested a course of treatment including chemotherapy, possible surgery after my treatments and clinical trials, when available, for my particular rare form of cancer. In addition, we are working with Davis Fertility Clinic, to ensure that after chemotherapy my wife and I will be able to complete our family with a second child.Being a Kaiser patient most of these treatments are not covered under the benefits we currently hold. I am looking for any support that can be offered. Any dollar amount is appreciated. No amount too small and any help will go a long way in aiding my family through this life altering event. Thank you for your time and continued love and support,Aaron, Lindsey and Mason DemuthMay 3rd, 2014, was the magical day that Kelly & Michael found out they would be blessed with another beautiful addition to their family.In August, while visiting the doctor for a routine checkup, the technician noticed an abnormality on Baby Finn\\'s heart.After days of follow ups with specialists, their world was turned upside down. IF Finn survived past birth, he would only live a few moments and IF he survived after that, he would immediately need open heart surgery.Kelly & Michael made the decision that in the few precious moments with Finn they would make sure he knew he is loved now and forever, though it would never be enough...Today, Finn is, most importantly, alive and loved. He has, however, required significant help from medical devices, oxygen delivery systems, special formula, and countless medical checkups, leaving a stack of medical bills along with it. This would put a strain on anyone, anywhere, but everyone would pay it in a heartbeat to save their baby. Every dollar helps to ease the financial burden. Join us in becoming Finn\\'s Fighters and help Kelly & Michael focus less on their wallets and more on their precious little Finn.This is Yassmeen Castanada\\'s story ... ..On Thanksgiving Yaasmeen was feeling ill. Common cold, sorethroat. A friend offered her an antibiotic pill that her friend had from a previous illness. She was thinking that it would help her, but this would be the biggest mistake of her life. After taking the pill , Yaasmeen started experiencing burning in her throat, eyes and mouth. As the night went by, her eyes became blood shot red and the lining of her lips was already torn off. I rushed her to the ER . The dr\\'s immediately diagnosed her with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Something I\\'ve never heard about. Immediately I googled Stevens Johnson\\'s and I began to panic. In my mind I knew this couldn\\'t happen to my baby, but deep down in the pit of my stomach was a terrible, terrible feeling. Within 4 days Yaasmeen\\'s appearance was transformed. I watched my daughter\\'s skin burn, blister, bubble, n peel off and there was nothing I could do about it. The pain and agony she was going through just tore my heart to pieces. She was transferred to UCIrvine\\'s burn unit. On December 5th she has surgery to scrape the top portion of her body. She was wrapped in biobrane. 2days later the bottom portion of her body was scraped. As you can see in the photo, she was wrapped in bandages from hed to toe. My daughter was intubated so she couldn\\'t communicate with me. i made sure i prayed over her daily, I spoke to her daily and reminded her that she had a daughter that loved her very much. Everyday i told her to fight for her life. Yaasmeens blood was infected and she has had 5 blood trasfusions. As we got closer to recovery, she had a set back. She was having a hard time breathing. After multiple exams of her trachea, they noticed her airway was closing so she had an emergency tracheotomy. she had her trach for 6months. There have been times where she had trouble breathing. She had another surgery in april to open her airway because it closed and the steriod injections didn\\'t work. On my birthday June 18th she had surgery to reconstruct her trachea. She was able to sing happy birthday to me as soon as the anesthesia wore off. Best gift ever! Today 6/25 Yaasmeen had her stitches removed. Yay! Her left eye is very damaged, she will need a cornea transplant. Hopefully in 6-8 months when she is healthier we can face that surgery. As for now, she will just work on getting healthier and spending a lot of time with her daughter Khloe and return to CSULA! This whole expierence has taught me to never take my children for granted. I almost lost my daughter to 1 pill! She never smoke or drank, she is a good kid that was on the right path. I just can\\'t understand why this happened the way it did. But we will not dwell in the past, She has goals and a bright future ahead of her. I thank all of you for your love, support and prayers for my daughter. *Please be careful with medications because an allergic reaction can happen to anyone. #prayforyaasCancer? That is not the diagnosis I wanted to hear post surgery that removed a 15cm mass from my abdomen but on 11/29 that was the pathology report & diagnosis that forever changed my life. Now at the age of 41 with my hubby of 12 years, Bryan and the loves of my life, Keira (10) and Isaac (8), I am about to embark on a life-saving adventure. We have an amazing network of wonderful people who love, encourage and support us that keep asking what they can do?To be able to beat cancer I will be using traditional and naturopathic treatments. We will have to drive 2 hours to Billings, MT every time I need treatment which will be additional expenses. At some point, I may need to travel out of state for future treatments. Bryan and I have both been off work the last two weeks and need to figure out how we will proceed. All money raised from this campaign will be used for living expenses, treatments not covered by insurance, all out of pocket treatment expenses and necessary travel expenses to Billings, MT and beyond.Looking for the background? I had noticed bloating and an occasional pain and decided I should go get it checked out. On Thursday 11/10/16 I met with my primary care doctor and she ordered an ultrasound. I was able to get in the next day, so Friday 11/11/16 I had a late afternoon ultrasound. It was the weekend now so it was time to wait. Monday 11/14/16 I received a call from my primary care doctor and was notified of a large, complex, cystic mass spanning my abdomen and was given an urgent referral to Gynecology. Given my moms death from Ovarian Cancer, they wanted me to get a CA125 blood test. I left work and did the blood test right away. By that evening, I received a call from Bozeman Womens Health that my CA125 was elevated. Given the blood test results, the abdominal mass, the abnormal pap and my health history, I was referred to a Gynecologic Oncologist in Billings, MT to investigate this further. I was able to see them on Wed 11/16/16. He ordered a CT scan and got back to us immediately. On our ride home, we were informed that the CT scan showed about a mass 15cm in diameter and that he thought the best option was to continue with the surgery we had scheduled for Tuesday 11/22/16. He said he would be pleasantly surprised if it wasnt cancer. On 11/22/16 at 4:30 am, Bryan, myself and my best friend Michelle started our drive to Billings, MT (approx 2 hours away from our home in Bozeman). The surgery lasted about 6 hours (much longer than anticipated). During the surgery, in addition to a full hysterectomy, I had my appendix, two segments of my colon and some lymph nodes removed. The surgeon said he removed all visible signs of cancer, for which I am extremely grateful! They also inserted two ports to be used for later treatments. One is on the right side on my chest, just below my shoulder. The other is on the left side of my abdomen just below my rib cage.I had several minor setbacks while in the hospital including low blood pressure issues. They also thought I had a blood clot in my lungs, but it turned out to be fluid in my lungs. I had a procedure to drain the fluid. Then I had issues with a racing heartbeat which required additional testing. Testing revealed that I had fluid in my abdomen which required another procedure to drain the fluid.Right now I have an incision that runs approx. 16 vertically through my abdomen which you can imagine makes everything very difficult. I will have a 4-6 week recovery time post surgery. Not sure when we will start treatment, but Ill keep everyone posted. After a 9 days in the hospital, I am now resting and recovering at home, which has not been easy. So far I have managed to stay positive and keep my spirits lifted. Telling the kids today that the doctor found cancer cells was the most heartbreaking and horrible experience I have had, but I know we will get through this together! I was 30 years old when my mom died and it was brutal. I do not want my kids to experience the same thing! What scares me is not being able to see my kids grow up, but this is a battle I will not lose! My goal is to get my body to optimal health and do whatever is necessary to live a long life with my kids and Bryan.My husband Bryan (my third child) has my back. He said since I carried the family the first 12 years (we celebrated our anniversary in the hospital), that it would be an honor to support and care for me during this next adventure. He has been wonderful through this process; enduring long nights in the hospital, drives to and from Billings, MT, taking care of the kids, helping with medication management and so much more. I am extremely blessed to have amazing family, friends and acquaintances that lifted me up in love and prayers! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!Every dollar helps! If you are unable to donate, please share via social media and send prayers our way!Our baby, Laurel Pearl Bares, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive pediatric cancer called Neuroblastoma on March 16, 2017. How did this happen? Laurel began acting extremely fussy and lost interest inher favorite foods in February2017. Although she was just learning to walk, she appeared unsteady and clumsy. We voiced our concerns to our pediatrician - multiple times via visits and phone calls, who just assured us it was normal behavior. Call it mother\\'s intuition, it just felt like something was very wrong. Fourdays after her first birthday on March 6, 2017, we took her for her 1 year checkup. She received vaccinations and was weighed - it was then we learned she was only in the 22% percentile for weight.As soon as Laurel receivedhervaccinations, shebecame very sick, and refused to eat or drink and began throwing up. I rushedher to the ER on March 13, 2017 for what Ibelieved would be for a bag of fluids. Upon seeing Laurel, the doctors asked that we ridevia ambulance to Children\\'s Hospital Boston. It was there that the doctor\\'s foundher blood pressure to be unusually high. And a mass was discovered in her abdomen.Hearing the word \"mass\" and understanding how serious this situation was, Brad and I felt helpless. Everything at that point accelerated, both in actual time and within ourselves. The team placed Laurel in the ICU for further testing.The tumor in Laurel\\'s abdomen measured the size of a large softball - about 8 cm wide. After it was biopsied, we learned that Laurel had Neuroblastoma. It was advanced as it had spread to her hips and was in 5% of her bone marrow. She was categorized to have MYCN amplified, high risk Stage IV Neuroblastoma.Since March, Laurel has undergone 5 rounds of high potency Chemotherapy. Each round lasted 21 days and became progressively stronger. Her tumor was resected in June and the surgeon believed he removed almost 99% of the mass.Sadly, in preparing for the next stage of treatment, Stem Cell Therapy, it was discovered by a nuclear scan on July 14th, 2017, that Laurel\\'s cancer has spread to both hips, her entire spinal column, jaw, and left side of her skull. Our doctor will not proceed with Stem Cell Therapy and explained that chemotherapy can have no effect on 10-15% of high-risk Neuroblastoma cases. It was explained that our future is grim, that the disease has advanced more than expected, and only a few therapies are left for Laurel.Laurel is considered to haverelapsed; however, we willnevergive up hope that she can be cured.At this point, we\\'ve explored all treatment options and are moving forward with a promising trial calledch.14/18IT Treatment with Irinotecan and Temodar. The chemotherapy/immunotherapy drug combination has been used in trials for about 5 years for kids with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma. It is not yet approved by the FDA. When ch14.18 attaches to Neuroblastoma cells, the body\\'s immune system is stimulated to attack and kill the Neuroblastoma cells. Laurel will begin this treatment on July 24th.Because the future remains unknown, we hope this fund with provide some financial padding if we decideto travel to another hospital for more experimental treatment.Brad has used up his earned time working at the hospital and we want to enjoy being with Laurel as much as possible now. Pray for Laurel. Kick and fight and heal for Laurel. Be good to each other and hug your babies hard.Love,The Bares FamilyPlease visit this site to read more about Laurel\\'s journey:Laurel\\'s Caring Bridge Medical JournalHi my name is, Raphael Strauss. I was born with an extremely rare skin disorder called, Xeroderma Pigmentossa. In short i have no immune system to repair damage from UV Rays from any source especially the sun. I havegone through over 300 hundred surgeries for the removal of skin cancers; Basil Cell Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma & Melanoma.More information can be seen at,  www.XPSOI.com. I am raising funds so that I can purchase a reliable vehichle that will be safe for me to travel to my medical appointments in a safe way. Please this is an urgent matter, at the moment I\\'m getting rides in vehicles that are not safe for me to travel in due to exposure to the UV Rays. The sooner that I will be able to raise the funds the sooner I will be able to protect myself while going to medical treatments. Every donation counts, Please I ask that everyne who see\\'s this to share it with your friends and to open your hearts and donate towards a great cause. Words can not express how thankful and grateful I am. With your help I will be able to get one step closer to a peaceful life, knowing that I will be safe when traveling to and from medical treatments.On Superbowl Sunday ourhome was broken into. Our innocent neighbor Craig Sandoval was in his garage getting parts to fix a shelf inside while his wife Marie was making nachos and wings for the game. Marie came outside to get Craig because the nachos were getting soggy and they happened to see the robbers in the alley in a box truck loading our belongings up without realizing fully what was happening. The robbers pointed a sawed off shot gun at both of them and threatened to shoot them. Craig told them to get out ofthere and one of the robbers shot him twice. He was hit in the arm and the stomach with the shotgun at close range. Luckily, Marie was not hit, nor was her son who had just arrived to watch the game with his family.Craig has had health issues his whole life requiring many surgeries. The wound to his stomach hit prior internal wounds and went through his stomach and intestines. 8 hours of surgery later, they have been able to get all of the pellets out of his stomach area but have had to do quite extensive work on his internal organs to keep them safe. His stomach wound remains open until the swelling is down to prevent infection.Craig\\'s arm was hit as well, and was broken in two places by the bullets. It is currently in a splint and he will go back into surgery today so they can double check that all the pellets have been removed in order to prevent a blood infection that can go to his heart and kill him.Obviously the medical bills will be quite extensive and while Craig has insurance, it will not be enough to cover it. Many people within our network have asked how they can help and this is the best way. Craig will be out of work for a minimum of 6 months now and he is the sole provider for their family. We will be helping them pay their day to day bills as well with personal funds.Craig is a wonderful neighbor, always watching out for us, giving us food from his garden, and being a really good guy. We are deeply saddened that he was a victim from a crime on our home and are deditcated to making sure he gets the care he needs. Thank you all for any help you can give. http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/denver-family-raising-money-for-neighbor-shot-while-stopping-men-burglarizing-their-home http://kdvr.com/2017/02/07/denver-man-shot-while-trying-to-stop-burglars-at-neighbors-home/Dear friends, (Opis po Polsku poniej)Please help us in getting Philip the medical treatment he needs! PLEASE SHARE AND DONATE! Follow Fifis progress on  https://www.facebook.com/groups/fifisway/Philip is 3 years old, and was enjoying a normal, healthy life until a tragic car accident on 11/17/16 resulting in multiple injuries, including traumatic brain injury, anoxic brain damage, C2 fracture, spastic quadriparesis, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation. The accident happened while my wife, Anna, got front-ended by a 3rd party while on the way to the preschool. The person who caused the accident is still under investigation.After two months of ICU hospitalization at Loyola, two months in-patient rehab at the Ability Lab (formerly Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago  RIC), and followed by outpatient rehabilitation, Philip is currently receiving his rehabilitation services through a school for children with special needs, which he recently begun. Hes also enrolled in a home therapy program done by parents and overseen by NACD (The National Association for Child Development), and receives speech therapy by Arlington Pediatric Therapy.Although doctors gave us the grimmest prognosis, Philip shows us every day that he is fighting and not giving up. From the start we saw that he is responding to his family, and we knew we needed to make sure he has our undivided support. We work with him every day in therapy and at home. He was successfully weaned off a respirator (and breaths independently through trache); he is reacting to his family, making cautious choices with his eyes and through use of a micro light switch, has a controlled use of his tone, and limited movements with his hands and legs. He\\'s tolerating sitting and standing, and started some very assisted walking in a pediatric walker!We know that our fight does not end here, as it is a marathon not a race. Luckily, we have Philips cord blood banked exactly so we could use it this hour of his greatest need, and this is it. Stem cells have an enormous medical potential, and todays medicine is making a lot of progress exploring their use for various conditions, including TBI.We have conducted so much research and explored all possible avenues of treatment for Philip in the United States and Canada, and although many clinics and hospitals were very interested in his case (due to the fact that not only he survived despite such great injuries, but he is also making progress) and eager to offer advice, in the end the answer was always the same We are so sorry ... we cant help. We couldnt take no for an answer. We looked further and explored the possibility of treatment in Europe, and eventually came across Dr. Dariusz Boruczkowski, Med. Dir. at the Polish Stem Cell Bank, (  https://www.pbkm.pl/en) who, after evaluating Philips case, decided to help us. Now, after a long assessment process, the Polish Stem Cells Bank started to work on the treatment for Philip which is administered by RegenMed, a neurological clinic in Cracow, Poland.  We are very hopeful about the treatment, as we know it is the only treatment available at this point that has such great potential to accelerate Philips recovery process and specifically to help repair and rebuild his brain allowing him to gain his functions back and thus giving him a chance, THE chance for recovery. The treatment will consist of a series of 5 to 10 procedures / stem cell injections into the lower parts of Philips spinal cord. Philip went through the initial procedure, which he tolerated very well, the following treatments are to be administered every 3 months. Now, the greatest obstacle on our way is to find the funding for the treatment itself and associated travel expenses. We estimated that we will need approximately $175,000 for the stem cell treatment, stem cell transportation, neurology and pediatric care, medical facility, nursing care, flights, lodging, as well as car / transportation needed to handle wheelchair and all the caregivers. Although we realize it is not an easy task to raise such amount of funds, we believe there is nothing insurmountable when it comes to our son. We will keep on moving forward and do all it takes so he has a chance at life.Thank you!Ania & LucasDrodzy Przyjaciele,Serdecznie prosimy o wsparcie i pomoc na leczenie dla naszego synka Filipka (Fifi). PROSIMY UDOSTEPNIJCIE T WIADOMOSC. Zapraszamy do sledzenia postpu Filipka na  https://www.facebook.com/groups/fifisway/Filipek ma 3 lata i cieszy si normalnym, radosnym yciem, a do momentu tragicznego wypadku samochodowego w 17stego listopada, 2016, w wyniku ktrego doznal wielu urazw, w tym pourazowego uszkodzenia mzgu, zatrzymanie akcji serca, niedotlenienie mzgu, zamanie kregu szyjnego C2, niedowad wszystkich koczyn, z przewag koczyn grnych, tracheotomia. Przez pierwsze miesiace potrzebowal respiratora do oddychania. Wypadek zostal spowodowany przez osob trzecia, gdy Ania, mama Filipka, odwozia dzieci do przedszkola. Filip jest obecnie w domu, po dwoch miesiacach hospitalizacji na oddziale intensywnej terapii w szpitalu Loyola, trzech miesicach rehabilitacji w Ability Lab (Instytucie Rehabilitacji w Chicago - RIC) i terapii ambulatoryjnej. Obecnie otrzymuje servisy terapeutyczne przez szkole dla dzieci ze specjalnymi potrzebami, terapie logopedyczna z Arlington Pediatric Therapy, jak rowniez cale spektrum terapi/ rehabilitacji (rozciganie, masae, zakres ruchu...) przeprowadzanej codziennie przez rodzicow pod nadzorem NACD (The National Association for Child Development). Lekarze nie dawali mu adnych szans, a mimo to Filip codziennie pokazuje nam, e walczy i si nie poddaje. Od samego pocztku widzielimy e On reaguje na najblisza rodzin i wiedzielimy e niewane co si wydazy, musimy by przy nim przez cay czas by go wspiera. Udao sie Filipkowi bezpiecznie zej z respiratora jeszcze w RIC (teraz oddycha samodzielnie, choc nadal przez trache  tracheotomie). Filipek reaguje na swoj rodzin, podejmuje powoli decyzje uywajac oczu, oraz uywa mikro-lekkiego przecznika, oraz ograniczone ruchy rk i ng. Przy duym wsparciu terapeutw Filip toleruje siedzenie i stanie, oraz jest w stanie zainicjowac ruchy na pediatrycznym chodziku. Czeka nas duga droga i walka o powrot Filipka do normalnego ycia.Jedyna leczenie ktore w tym momencie rozwoju medycyny istnieje, jest leczeniem komorkami maciezystymi. (Na szczecie, dzieki poradzie ktora otrzymlismy w czasie porodu Filipka, zachowalismy jego krew ppowinow, czyli najsilniejsze komorki macierzyste!) Komrki macierzyste maj ogromny potencja medyczny i codziennie posuwaja sie do przodu badania wykorzystywania ich w leczeniu wielu schozen, miedzy innymi urazach mzgu.Prbowalimy znale opcje leczenia w Stanach Zjednoczonych i Kanadzie, rozmawialimy z wieloma szpitalami i klinikami. Niestety, otrzymalimy od nich rne rady, ale na kocu odpowied zawsze bya taka sama \"Bardzo nam przykro, nie moemy pomc\". Oczywiscie, nie moglimy przyj takiej odpowiedzi i szukajac dalej, tym razem w Europie, dotarlismy do Dr. Dariusza Boruczkowskiego z Polskiego Banku Komrek Macierzystych (  www.pbkm.pl), kty po zapoznaniu si z wynikami Filipka zdecydowa sie Mu pomc.Filipek zostal zakwalifikowany do przeprowadzenia eksperymentalnej terapii komrkami macierzystymi w klinice neurologicznej w Krakowie- RegenMed. Leczenie to skada si z serii 5-10 zabiegw/zastrzykw komorek macierzystych w dolna czesc rdzenia kregowego. Pierwszy zabieg odbyl sie w pazdzierniku byl sukcesem! Filipka cialo dobrze go zaakceptowalo i bez powiklan mogl powrocic do domu w przeciagu tygodnia. Nastepne zabiegi odbywac sie beda co 3 miesiace. Jestesmy pelni nadzieji, i pomimo ze wedlug neurologow Polskich wiekszy postep powinien byc widoczny dopiero po trzecim zabiegu, codziennie wypatrujemy jakis zmian. Jedyne co teraz stoi nam na drodze to sa koszta zwiazane z leczeniem.Wedug naszych wylicze bedziemy potrzebowac okoo $175.000 na transport i przeszczepy komrek macierzystych, opaty medyczne i lekarskie, opiek pielgniarsk, przeloty do Polski, zamieszkanie, oraz wynajem auta  transport dostosowany do obslugi wzka inwalidzkiego.Bdziemy bardzo wdziczni za jakkolwiek pomoc dla naszego synka Filipka. To wszystko jest dla niego, by da Mu drug szans na powrt zdrowia, by znw mg si umiecha, biega i cieszy si yciem. Bardzo prosimy o wsparice w walce o zdrowie naszego synka. Serdecznie Dzikujemy!Ania i ukaszOn March 30, 2017, 8 year old Wyatt and his father were found in their home with gun shot wounds. His father unfortunately was pronounced dead at the scene.Wyatt was airlifted to Duluth and underwent major surgery to relieve pressure on his brain.He is currently still in critical condition with his grandparents standing by his side while he fights for his life.We are creating this page and asking for donations to help pay for the medical costs that have accrued and will continue as he fights for his life.We also ask for prayers for him as well as his family as they face this difficult journey.Maximillian \"Keegan\" Free Moore was diagnosed with stage one Kidney cancer on May 26th, 2017. Keegan is 23 years old, is a long term member of Northside Baptist Church in Weatherford, and when he isn\\'t working Keegan spends his time helping others. If you know Keegan,  you know two things: (1) he\\'s going to offer you a cup of tea &  (2) if you\\'re in need he\\'s there to help in anyway that he can. Keegan has a servants heart and that is what led him to finding out the news about his Kidney. Keegan had it on his heart to donate one of his kidneys to someone in need, when he went to the doctor to get tested to donate is when he found out he has had cancer for a year. Keegan still hasn\\'t had surgery to remove his Kidney because he does not have health insurance. He has spent the past month researching and trying to get insurance but still hasn\\'t been able to get it. After the surgery Keegan will be in recovery up to 3 months, and unable to work. I have made this fundraiser for Keegan\\'s surgery, hospital stay, food, and bills. I hope that the community that Keegan has spent half his life serving will return the favor and serve him. I ask you all to be in prayer for healing, and for God\\'s hand to be on this whole process. I will keep you all updated! Thank you! -Mycah (Long term friend/family friend)Paige and Tate Lombard are teachers at Wall ISD. Tate is also the head girls\\' cross country and basketball coach.

Thank you2 year old Jaszelina was diagnosed with a 5 inch long tumor in herspine and underwent surgery on her birthday August 4th.The doctors were not sure if the tumor was cancerous or benign and since it was in her spine there was a chance she would be paralyzed after surgery.Many prayers went out for the best possible outcome, which were answered when the preliminary diagnosiscame back asstage 1 andbenign. Jaszelina faces a long recovery period and Mom will be out of work for at least 2-3 months. We are asking for any type of financialaide thatyou can give to help the family get through this tough period of recovery. Jaszelina needs a new bed and the family will need help with rent and bills. Thank you so much in advance for yourcaringand compassion.In January 2017, we set out on a mission to find a cure for our daughter Milas devastating condition, Batten Disease a disorder that rips abilities, and then life, away from children. After fighting for Mila\\'s life day and night for almost one year, it seems unreal that we are telling you that Mila will receive a potentiallyLIFE-SAVING TREATMENTthis JANUARY.Theres no other way to put itmy 7-year-old daughter, Mila, is dying. I lie by her side every night when she sleeps and my heart bleeds. My face burns from the tears.Mila could be your child. She splashed in the pool, begged for chocolate ice cream, and sang her favorite songs. She rode bikes. She skied. But at 4 years old, she started to fall over, to bump into things. She pulled books in close, got stuck on words. She was finallydiagnosed withBatten Disease,a rare fatal genetic condition that robs normal children of everything. They end up bedridden, on a feeding tube, with seizures, and cognitively impaired. There is no cure... yet.We were given no hope. Butwe discovered that scientists are just now able to STOP and even REVERSE genetic diseases like Batten. So we fought day and night and have raised over $1.5M to fund the science that could lead to a cure. Our tireless work and YOUR incredible supporthave paid off.Mila will receive a new and potentially LIFE-SAVING treatment this JANUARY.It seems unreal.Mila is rapidly declining every day. Our team of scientists is working around the clock to make this treatment happen as soon as humanly possible. But Mila\\'s future is still unknown so we are continung to raise money so we\\'re prepared for the unexpected costs. And we have already begun working on our next project that could compliment Mila\\'s treatment and help many other children._______________________________________YOU CANSAVE MILA!!1) GIVE whatever you can.

No words can describe watching Mila lose her vision, her ability to talk and walk. Mila still has her laughter and excitement for life. But we know this too will soon start to fade.

Our mission is to fund treatments for Batten Disease with a goal of ending it forever. We are currently racing against time to fund a cutting-edge gene therapy trial we have put together with the very best in the field. But saving lives is expensive. Mila and other children like her deserve the chance for gene therapy to stop the disease before it\\'s too late. We CAN save children\\'s lives together!Recent press:Fox News TodayGoFundMeBlog PostOn Monday October 12th, after a number of weeks of not feeling or acting like her normal effervescent self, our 38 years-young, non-smoking friend Lesley was admitted to the hospital. After a week long battery of tests, everyone\\'s worst fears were realized when the diagnosis came back as an aggressive form of lung cancer, which had spread to various parts of her body including her brain. Further complicating matters, Lesley was then 30 weeks pregnant with their second child. On October 21st, Lesley had brain surgery to remove the two largest tumors in her left temporal lobe that have been causing her to struggle to find her words. With the first of her surgeries behind her, her team of oncology and obstetrics doctors have now turned their focus towards determining the best plan for chemotherapy and radiation treatment while balancing the health and well-being of their growing baby, who thankfully does not appear to be negatively impacted by any of the tumult going on within Lesley\\'s body.This fund is intended to help offset what will turn out to be a very costly battle against Lesley\\'s cancer. In a world where insurance coverage exceptions and high deductibles can bankrupt families, we want to help cover the cost of whatever we can, from childcare to trips to the hospital, that will allow Lesley and Chris to focus 100% of their energy on getting her better. Whether you know Lesley from Rhode Island, Chicago, London, Babson, soccer teams, work, or the number of countless other ways she\\'s touched our lives, you know that Lesley always goes out of her way to put a smile on your face. We\\'ve created this fund so that Lesley and her family can focus on her health to ensure we, along with her children, will be seeing that smile for decades to come. Since being admitted on the 12th, Lesley has remained in the hospital surrounded by her loving and supportive husband Chris, her parents and siblings, and a number of other family and close friends have been visiting from far and wide. Lesley and Chris\\' 2-year old son Lachlan gets to Skype with mom before bed and is blissfully unaware of what\\'s going on, relishing the extra love and attention from having so many friends and family around. [This fund is being overseen by Irene and Rob, two friends of Lesley from her college days at Babson and beyond]A great family and our best friends need your help.

Typically, she is an energetic and upbeat person, able to handle all sorts of work-related and parental pressures; a supermom in all respects. Michelle was buying supplies for her Kale Drink product line, dealing with new customer contracts, thinking about preparing her 7-year old daughter, Qiana, for after-school dance and music classes. However, she was not able to finish her busy day as planned. In fact, in the middle of all that activity her body failed her.By the end of that Friday, Michelle was rushed to Hoag Memorial Emergency due to several fainting episodes, severe headaches, and back pain throughout the afternoon. The initial MRIs of her head and torso revealed that there were approximately 2.0 cm growths on her brain stem and lower lumbar spinal cord. The on-call neurologist immediately performed brain surgery to implant a VP shunt to relieve the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) accumulating in Michelles head due to the growth at the brain stem. This was a life-saving operation according to the neurologist, done at the nick of time. Any further delay would have resulted in organ shutdown and death, probably within 24 hours, as the brain became more and more damaged with the increased inter-cranial pressure.Michelles work ethic and devotion to her daughter is much admired by her many friends, colleagues, and of course family. Shes been intimately involved with the fast-paced Vietnamese entertainment industry in Orange County, CA, for decades and is probably the reason why her daily personal rhythm is just as fast paced. It is such a shock to witness Michelles current condition, not only with regards to the seriousness of the MRI findings, but how totally incapacitated Michelle became overnight. In fact, if it were not for Luu Bich, Michelles close friend, insisting to go to the emergency room, Michelle would have soldiered on through her pain per her normal personality.It has now been several weeks since the initial surgery that saved her life. The growths have been confirmed to be malignant, but a final determination of the type of cancer cell is in dispute within the Hoag Cancer Board. The lesion on the brain stem is inoperable; and the lesions on the spinal cord have been observed to be spreading. Treatment plans are not finalized until the cancer cell type is concluded. It is assumed that there will be a combination of low yield radiation and chemotherapy. The family hopes to find alternatives through clinical trial drugs that may have better tolerated side effects. In addition to the physical and emotional toll due to the cancer, Michelle has had to close down her existing business and stop all contract discussions. Her apartment had to be vacated, her belongings stored, since she requires 24/7 assisted care. Her daughter, Qiana, is carefully being taken care of by the extended family, but misses her mom. It was only a week after her 7th birthday that Michelle began to get critically ill. On top of the substantial medical bills after almost a month of hospitalization, Michelle has lost her ability to generate income. Her family and friends at Paris by Night (Thy Nga Productions) and Little Chopin Music School are establishing this GoFundMe account to show their love and support for Michelle and Qiana, a mother and daughter team who mean so much to all of us. No donation is too small; hopefully we can fix the financial burden to a significant degree that it is one less thing that Michelle has to worry about. We want her to enjoy quality time with her daughter as much as she can.Marie To & Paul Huynh - Thuy Nga ProductionsMichelle & friends. Loan Chau, Thanh Truc, Michelle, Marie To, Luu BichMolly Nguyen, Little Chopin Piano SchoolMichelle\\'s StoryAs most of you may already be aware, Staci\\'s sister Steph was sadly and unfortunately killed in a car accident. The accident took place in Jamaica where Steph and her husband were visiting their two children. The husband and kids survided, but are in critical condition. I ask that you pray for their quickrecovery. To help Staci and her family prepare for their trip to Jamaica and all other expenses related to this terrbible event, I have set up this GoFundMe campaign to help them off-set some of the costs. As you can imagine, flights during this time of year are incredibly expensive, so every little bit helps. I am sure that Staci and her family will be extremely thankful for your donation. Thank you in advance!Hello, My name is Chris Lester one of Tom Barbera\\'s many good friends. This page has been set up to help support our good friend Tom \"Tommy\" Barbera. Tom for the past three years has been fighting a rare diesese called Cardiac Sarcoidosis.Cardiac sarcoidosis is a rare disease in which clusters of white blood cells, called granulomas, form in the tissue of the heart. Any part of the heart can be affected, though these cell clusters most often form in the heart muscle where they can interfere with the hearts electrical system (conduction defects) and cause irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). Cardiac sarcoidosis can also result in heart failure. A little over a year ago Tom had aImplantable Cardioverter Defibrillator installed to help with the arrhythmias. Although the diffibrillator is helping Tommy, it is not the fix. Tom will ultimately need a heart transplant. The last month has been very hard on Tom and his family with more than a few Cardiac episodes. Tom is the owner and Chief Mechanic of East Fork Pro Marine in Hamlin NY. Tommy for years has repaired many of our community boats including the many fishing vessals at Sandy creek. Tom is that guy who puts the personal and trust worthy touch in his work. Tom has never hesitated to help anyone of us fisherman when we needed a repair in a hurry. Tom always makes sure we were back on the water quickly. The battle has taken Tommy away from his buisness and has put a strain on him and his family with the mounting medical and financial bills. Its now our turn to give back to Tom and help him, Please consider a monetary donation to help Tom and his family.Thank you.Kahleel is only 20 days old, born on December 28th 2016. He was born with a very rare genetic disorder called EB or Epidermolyosis Bullosa. EB is a skin disease that makes your skin very fragile. So fragile infact it can simply peel or rub off because of the slightess friction. Even clothes can be to harsh at times, the caress and embrace of his parents could actually create enough friction to cause painful blisters that fill with fluid and burst leaving raw unprotected sores, leaving him susceptible to many infections. There is no cure for EB. The only treatment is pain management and bandaging. The pain management and bandages will be needed for life, in fact depending on the type of EB some patients only have a life expectancy of 25 years of age. Kahleel is currently awaiting biopsy results to determine the type he has but already in his short life he has endured so much suffering and pain. His father is an active member of the US Navy stationed in Bremerton, WA. Him and his wife have been living in a children\\'s hospital in Seattle Washington awaiting authorization to be life flighted to a EB Center in Cincinatti Ohio where they can be close to family and friends for aid and support. Please help this family get to the medical facility that can effectively help Kahleel. Because the disorder is so rare the doctors have not provided the proper care and his conditions has actually gotten worsesince he was admitted to NICU on January 4th. He currently has lost 60% of the skin on his little body. As you can imagine there is so much red tape and financial battles that have prevented this family from getting to the EB center. The family needs to get a medical flight to Cincincati so he can be cared for by the experts who deal with this condition on a regular basis. Please take time to research this disease.. It is in fact \"The Worst Disease You Never Heard Of\" Then please take time to donate to Kahleel\\'s family and any other families suffering from this horrible condition. This money helps support the family\\'s travel back and forth from Ohio to Washington State, that is not being covered by insurance. It will also help pay for room and board for days, months and weeks of living in hotels and hospitals. It will also cover cost for the expensive special clothing and bandages for Kahleel. It will also go towards medical supplies. Any help goes a long way. Thank you for your support!!I am starting this campaign on behalf of my 11 year old nephew Ashton Yates (Bishop). Ashton was in a boating accident on Sunday, May 28th, 2017. Ashton was enjoying a fun-filled day with his family when things tragically took a turn for the worse. Ashton fell off the front of the boat and was pulled under the boat and struck the propellar. He suffered a broken wrist, broken finger, severe leg lacerations and nerve damage. Ashton is currently in Children\\'s Hospital. At this time, he has been through 2 surgeries and he\\'llhave many more. Itis expected that Ashton will be at Children\\'s hospital for quite some time.Please consider contributingto help Brian and Blair with medical billsand other expenses that arise from missed work due tothem beingwith their son during this difficult time. Please keep the Yates/Bishop families in your prayers!If you are looking at this site, you know and love the Rose Family. Many have asked how they can help this precious family in their time of need. First and foremost, PRAYER. This is their greatest need and deepest desire, that we would all join them in praying for Boogie\\'s quick and complete healing, that each of them would experience Christ\\'s presence and peace, and that through it all, God would be glorified in and through them. Please join us in praying, fasting and perservering in faith on behalf of Boogie, Stephany, Keaton, Zeke and Charis.If you would still like to help in other ways, please consider donating to this fund to help cover their growing medical expenses. Boog\\'s hospital stay has already been longer than anticipated and will likely continue well in to the New Year. This is leading to many other expenses in addition to medical bills. Though Boog and Steph would undoubtebly insisit that we not ask this, financial assistance is one of the most tangible and helpful ways that we as friends and family can serve them during this very challenging time. Thank you for your consideration.Our family would also love to see this site used as an alternative to texts as a way to encourage the Roses and hear updates on Boog\\'s condition. Sweet Steph appreciates everyone\\'s love and encouragement so much, and it is her family\\'s hope that the comments left here would lift her spirits and remind her that they are not alone in this battle, all the while allowing her more time to focus on Boog, the kids, and prayer, without the need to reply to constant texts and voicemails. We will update this site regularly with any important changes so that everyone can be kept up to date and have clear direction on how to best pray.Thank you so much for your love and prayers. They are invaluable and we can\\'t thank you enough. Boog and Steph have expressed numerous times that they feel covered in prayer and are experiencing the Lord in new and beautiful ways. We praise God for His faithfulness.Hi I am Michael Jones, and one of my friends, who has ALWAYS been the first to give me support when I am going through tough times, is now needing all the help that WE can give her. Daphne Reynolds has been diagnosed with Stage three lung cancer. She is in the hospital, awaiting surgery, and we are all praying for her to get the best results possible, and \"kick cancers ass and take names\", as her husband Chad Reynolds told me this morning. This is going to be a long, tough fight, and I have no doubt that Daphne will beat this. But along with the fight comes the expense of the travel, loss of work for Chad, incredibly steep medical bills and taking care of the house and the kids. We can help them with all of this. I know all of us here in Bangshift, Facebook, riding, NHRA, IHRA, PDRA, and the rest of you, are the most giving and loving of all people. And we can help this most deservign and hardworking couple out. Lets show them all the love we have, please? I know that they would give hands down, and have for any one of us. God bless you all.....Michael Jones.Corinne Strong. One of the sweetest young ladies we know .. and a member of a fantastic family is about to embark on an unknown journey.

Any proceeds raised will go directly to the Hare\\'s and Corrine\\'s treatment.As some of you may know, our younger brother Jean Paul was diagnosed with metastatic stage 4 colon cancer on June 26, 2016. JP started experiencing back and side pains a few months before his diagnosis. But with the excitement of his first child on the way, he never thought to follow up on it. It wasnt until two weeks after his daughter Serenity was born, that he would receive devastating news. JP & Marquise were home with their newborn when JP started feeling pain. This time the pains were so intense, his wife Marquise insisted on heading to the emergency room. Once there, they ran a series of tests that ultimately yielded the worst news anyone could hear. This is not supposed to happen to anyone, especially someone just blessed with a beautiful newborn to care for, love, laugh, nurture, guide, and protect. Life is filled with so many twists and turns. Although this news would knock anyone down, our brother faced it head on. What more motivation than to want to live to see your baby girl grow. He started chemotherapy two weeks later. He was feeling good. Obviously, as any aggressive treatment for cancer will do, he grew tired and weak but continued to work and provide for his family. In late February, Marquise noticed a bump on his back. Further scans revealed new tumors on his spine, hip and back. He underwent three rounds of radiation. After starting to feel pain in his neck and getting really bad headaches, they discovered he also had a tumor in his skull. At this point the radiation really wore him down. In early May, he decided to take a leave of absence from his job to concentrate on taking better care of himself by following a stricter eating regimen along with exercise. He also wanted to spend more time with Marquise and Serenity.Unfortunately, the hit and punches didnt end there. A year after the initial diagnosis, he is now undergoing the last chemo treatment they can offer him. His tumors have increased 30%. Once this treatment is complete, JPs only option is alternative medicine. This is not something that his insurance will cover and as many know, can be very expensive. This is the last option my brother and his family have. My brother is no ordinary person. He definitely carries my mothers strong bloodline and her will to fight. Just like my mother, I have yet to hear JP throughout this ordeal ask why this is happening? Why him? Why GOD, with all his power and might, would allow this to happen. He has been incredibly positive from day one. Daring this disease to take its best shot at him so he can swing back harder.JP has been blessed with many things. A highly supportive wife in Marquise, and incredible in-laws that have literally treated him as their own son. While hundreds of miles separate us, we cant help but think of our brother and what hes going through every breathing moment of our day. We wish there was something we could do to provide comfort, and ease his pain. JP is our hero. Because while we sense hes taken many chinks in his armor as a result of all hes endured to date, you wont hear him second guess the path his life has taken. We dont think, in fact know, youll meet anyone going through such a debilitating disease be as positive about things like our brother. JP continues a long uphill battle. That is why after much debate about when to put something like this together, we finally reach out to you today. We kindly ask that you keep my brother and his family in your prayers. and consider making a donation. Even with insurance, medical bills can be a huge financial burden. From doctors bills and insurance co-payments, to travel costs and lost wages. Any donation you make can be of enormous help to him and his perfect little family.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking the time to read about my brothers plight.We will continue to post updates on his development, and again thank you for thinking of our hero and baby brother, Jean Paul Tamayo.Pat Blake was life flighted to Mercy in Des Moines on June 10th due to injuries sustained at Blakes Auto Repair.  Due to the severity of his left leg injury Pat will need multiple extensive reconstructive surgeries. Starting immediately upon his arrival he underwent a 11 hour surgery to restore blood flow to his lower leg.  Due to this he will be unable to work for an undetermined amount of time at his business. We know Pat, Michelle, Brock, Abby,Luke and Jude would appreciate all the help and prayers they can get.  Due to these unfortunate events Pat and Michelle will be unable to travel with their children and family on their Disney vacation next week. Please help us lift their spirits. Thank you, Jason & Sarah OrtonBrad & Ashley BurtnettOur sweet Nic was unfortunate enough to be one of the very few to get infected with Dengue Fever. I met Nic in Bali at our amazing yoga teach training. After Bali we decided to meet up in Thailand to travel for a few days in Chiang Mai. After being in Chiang Mai for a few days he started to feel very tired  and then quickly developed an severe headache, extreme body pains, and an outrageous fever. We decided to go to the hospital and after a few short hours, we received the very concerning news that he has Dengue Fever. He was quickly admitted to a comfortable room with friendly staff. Unfortunately there is no cure or treatment for Dengue. The nurses are taking his blood every morning and watching his platelet and white blood cell count to make sure they don\\'t fall to unsafe lows. Although his fever is now gone, he is sill under close watch. He has been in the hospital since May 2nd and since his platelets are not at a stable number, he is unable to leave the hospital or go home to FL.  Although tired and sick, Nic is in good spirits and positive about his recovery. He is troubled, however, with the insurance bill. He need to pay the hospital up front and out of pocket. The bills have been adding up due to all the hospital expenses. Since we do my know exactly when Nic will be released, the bills will keep on adding. Nic needs your help! I started this GoGundMe so we can help Nic affore these unfortunate medical bills.Hello my name is Keenan Patton. I am 31 years old and I\\'m from Chicago, Illinois. I have a severe skin condition that I contracted from having the chicken pox when I was younger that has altered my overall appearance drastically. My face, head, and other parts of my body have abnormal growths called Keloids which have grown to a substantially large size and have now gotten to a point where they seem to almost be a medical hazard. I\\'ve undergone 7 surgeries as well as injections and to no avail have any of them been successful. The reocurrence of them have been somewhat of a strike towards my overall confidence, physical appearance, and health. So I\\'m asking for any financial assistance that you are able to give because the kind of insurance that I have is out of their particular network that they deal with. I\\'ve found the doctor that I want to perform my LAST surgery (Dr. Michael Jones/Keloid Specialist) but there are 2 things that I need to get before I can see him: 1. The surgery is about $25,000 and 2. His closest office is in New York. So to any and all who can possibly help me with this, it would be greatly be appreciated. Thank you in advance for you time, consideration, and gift!In December Julie was diagnosed with triple negative metastatic breast cancer, stage 4. After having extensive testing she was informed the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes, thyroid, lung and liver. In January she was told the cancer was terminal and they would not be doing surgery to remove any of the masses.Julie has worked for the airline for over 25 years and due to company mergers and downsizing, and several pay cuts, Julie decided to leave the airline and return home to Brookings. During her search for employment she was diagnosed with cancer and for the first time in her life was not insured.Currently her Dr is trying to get her into a research study that could prolong her life and help manage the spread of the cancer. At this time there is no cure but if she responds to medications she could prolong her life.Any money received will help Julie pay for medical bills and living expenses as she begins treatment. Julie knows she is terminal and has told the Dr she does not want to know how much time she has. Julie\\'s faith is strong and she believes with the right medications and the support of friends and family she can manage her cancer and extend her life.\"If Tim Berners-Lee is the father of the Web, than Molly Holzschlag is its fairy godmother.\"Who is Molly Holzschlag?

All money collected from this effort will go towards medical expenses and recovery costs.What\\'s Happened to Molly? In April, Molly was diagnosed with a rare liver condition, which ravages her internal organs causing fatigue, dizziness, confusion, loss of appetite, and weakness. Immediately, Molly was put on a very restrictive diet, vitamin regimen, and chemo-therapy. According to her doctors, Molly needs to continue with another 6-9 months of chemo-therapy to go into full remission. Molly\\'s doctors told her that she could not work, while undergoing this extreme treatment.Molly was employed at the small NPO Knowbility as the Open Web Evangelist. Knowbility was able to put her on Family and Medical Leave which allowed Molly to retain her health insurance coverage. The FMLA time period has ended and the only coverage available now is through COBRA. Molly\\'s current coverage lasts until November 1, 2013. She does have a one month supply of pills. The monthly cost of her chemo-therapy is about $2,800 and COBRA will be an additional $1000. With a long recovery expected and the inability to work, Molly needs our financial support. Her mother and brother are doing what they can, but now Molly needs us. We know it is a tough time for many people. Here is how you can help. 1. Give whatever you can.

After an extensive hospital stay he was diagnosed with CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy). This is a rare disorder of the nerves characterized by sensory loss and overall muscle weakness. Nick\\'s case was so severe that he is now bed bound. Nick can use his arms but has no voluntary muscle movement in his legs. He was also recently diagnosed with T cell lymphoma (a type of blood cancer). He requires 24 hour care and has multiple doctor appointments each week. Despite Nick\\'s hardships he continues to fight each and every day. This fundraiser is to help his family purchase a wheelchair accessible van and other necessary medical equipment not covered by his insurance company. Please consider any donation you can for a wonderful man with a big heart and an even bigger spirit. All donations will be handled by Nick\\'s daughter (Nicole Castagna). Thank you for your prayers and generosity.As many of you know, Amy was transported to the U of M this past weekend. While she has a team of doctors working tirelessly to heal her, no answers have been found. She is currently on dialysis and a ventilator. We as a community decided this was one way we could help them with medical and unexpected expenses that come with having a family member in the hospital that far from home. Thank you for your support.I never thought I would have to create a page like this, but one of my dearest friends in the world is going through an experience no one should have to endure and needs as much help as possible. Two nights ago around 11pm she brought her 13 year old daughter to the ER .... By 2am she was told that her daughter was severely anemic and needed a blood transfusion;her daughter was admitted to the hospital.At 9am an oncologist sat with her and gave her the news no parent wants to hear....her daughter was diagnosed with leukemia. By the end of the day yesterday she had 2 blood transfusions, surgery to put in a port, extract bone marrow and spinal fluid and delivered her first dose of chemo.We are trying to raise money to help with Emani\\'s medical costs and to allow Krystal Settles to take unpaid leave from work so she can be there fully for her daughter as she should be. ANY amount would be appreciated and go a long way, thank you!At around 2:15-2:30 AM early Thursday morning, June 22nd, Nick suffered an accident while riding his motorcycle on the way home from a night out with his friends. He was less than 1/4 from being home where the accident occurred. Alcohol was not the reason. The circumstances of the accident are unclear unfortunately. Nick suffered a traumatic brain injury which included a right sided skull fracture and brain bleeding. It is assumed he was wearing his helmet at the time of the accident (since there is damage on the helmet in the same area as his injuries) but that it fell off after the initial hit and the subsequent hits caused the damage. Nick was moved to UCI Medical Center and currently resides in the surgical ICU. He remains intubated on very heavy sedation and requires a breathing tube to help him breathe. He also has a drain placed in his head to relieve swelling and pressure build-up. He has been able to move his extremities involuntarily and his pupils react appropriately, but he is unable to respond to commands as he is under so much sedation, so the extent of the damage done to his brain cannot be fully determined at this time. The expectation is that Nick will require many weeks if not months in the hospital and even longer time potentially to rehab as he is likely to have significant physical deficits. Any monetary donations or prayers are greatly appreciated as they will all be used towards his bills, medical expenses and children since he can not work. His girls need their daddy and his mom, brother and I need him as well as his entire family and friends!What would you do if your child was given a diagnosis of terminal cancer, with a prognosis of only a handful of months to live?What would you be willing to sacrifice if you could buy more time, even if it was just for a few days or a few months? What is the value of a few more memories with your daughter?These are questions that we all hope will remain merely hypothetical in our lives and in the lives of our loved ones. But, they have become all too real for Paul and Vicky Duersch, who received the news on August 5, 2016 that their five year old daughter Lucy has diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). This type of cancer is only found in children, and starts in the pons area of the brainstem, which controls vital functions such as breathing and heart rate.Most children do not live more than nine months after being diagnosed. 99% of all children diagnosed with this disease do not survive more than five years. Current treatments can slow the progression of the disease, but there is no cure, and there is no expected survivorship.While we never give up hope for a miracle, we should not forget the miracle that we all have the power to create. We can band together to fill whatever time Lucy may have left in this life with a tremendous outpouring of love for her and for her family. It\\'s sad to think of all the experiences she will not have: graduating from school, getting married, having children of her own. None of us are in a position to give her those experiences. But we can give her a powerful experience of seeing the best this world has to offer: kind-hearted, compassionate people reaching out and lifting each other\\'s burdens.Paul and Vicky need our help. Treatments will be expensive. And even then, they don\\'t have the ability to make these investments in the hope that they will save Lucy\\'s life, baring a very tangible miracle. They are buying time.The funds from this campaign will be used to help cover the expense of medical bills, travel, food, missed work, and the many other costs that Paul and Vicky are going to accrue. If we are able to raise enough funds, the funds will also be used to allow Paul to take more time off from work to be with Lucy and to be a support to Vicky.The need is immediate: Lucy starts treatment on August 9th. The need is ongoing, for as long as Lucy may have left. The need may linger even past that time.Please, help us help them however you can. Even small donations will make a difference. Even just sharing this information with your contacts can make a difference. You can help us make all the difference in the world for Lucy at this time. Our meaning in life is found in moments like this. Our gratitude for your willingness to help is inexpressable.My name is Jodi Pattrin-Hillhouse, and I thank you for taking the time to visit my page.  First my story, and then a list of goals that I hope this fundraiser will help me achieve.\\n\\nI am a survivor of extreme domestic violence.  I lost my health, my home, my possessions, my life savings, my sense of self, my professional reputation... virtually everything but my life.\\n\\nIn one way, at least, I was one of the lucky ones; in the sense that I DID get out with my life, and even luckier for the fact I am not at all tempted to go back.\\n\\nHowever, like most women who survive this sort of situation, and are starting all over, at the bottom of the heap.. my life since has been a state of hand-to-mouth survival with few if any opportunities to improve the situation. I still kept hope alive, and kept trying.\\n\\nHowever, a cancer diagnosis has thrown me off track, and now even I must admit I cannot do thison my own.  I must stop the backslide, take a stand, and eliminate the issues keeping me from getting on my feet. \\n\\nI need tools for success, and I felt I\\'d put the request out to the universe, and pray for a response. If you wish to help, but cannot donate, please consider sharing the link, joiningOur Official Facebook Page, sending well wishes, prayers, love, etc.  Every little bit helps, BELIEVE ME, whether it\\'s a few dollars, a few kind words, or a few clicks of the share button.\\n\\nRaising money for\\n\\n-- Medical treatment for cancer,complex PTSD, reparing abuse injuries, and assorted health issues\\n\\n--Moving expenses for the forced relocation at the end of October, and the move that will occur when I rent my own place again\\n\\n--A modest but reliable car,(something like a 90\\'s Honda) registration, and a couple months operating expenses. This is a vital tool to help me get to appointments, and improve my job situation. Especially as my health is slipping and inclimate weather is coming.\\n\\n--Spay and finish training my dog and complete the work  that needs to be done so she may be myofficial service  animal. (she already functions as one, I wish to be able   to smooth out the rough edges, and have her legal        status as a service animal, confirmed)\\n\\n--A process server and lawyer to aid my effort to divorce   the husbandwho has been dodging the disolving of the marraige. He has admitted in emails that he does this tomake it difficult for me to move on, both            emotionally, and on paper. For my emotional recovery,  and my ability to seek grants or qualify for come         assistance programs,without marital status affecting   it, the divorce must happen.\\n\\n--backup emergency reserve for the \"little essentials\"      replacing work shoes, buying uniforms for new jobs,      emergency vet bills, buying guaze and other supplies if   I start suppurating again, etc.\\n\\n--Help with bills that piled up when unable to work\\n\\n-- A little extra to go to the taxes I must pay on this. \\n\\n-- EXTRA SPECIAL WISH:  If this reaches it\\'s total goal,   I\\'ll not only be able to take care of the above issues, I     will have money to begin attending a local community   college, such as Metro.\\n\\nThank you again for your time in reading this.

       "  'Our Fundis raising money to establish an education trust for the surviving daughter of US Marine Corps veteran Brandon Slack, who lost his battle with PTSD on 22 October 2013.Brandon was a stand-out high school athlete, loyal friend, and devoted father who served in two deployments to Iraq with 1st Battalion 5th Marines--serving in the First Battle of Fallujah (Operation Vigilant Resolve) and Ar Ramadi. As a veteran, Brandon pursued avid interests in physical fitness, the outdoors, photography, and art. Outgoing, friendly, and willing to do anything for a laugh, Brandon inspired countless fellow Marines during his military tenure, and touched countless more lives when he embarked on his post-military life. His suicide came as a shock to everyone including those who knew him best.With Brandon gone, a number of fellow Marines with whom he served have organized this fund to honor his memory and provide educational opportunities for his sevenyear old surviving daughter, Marley (pictured above). With your help, we can reach our goal of $25,000 which will be used to establish an education trust for Marley, so she can pursue her education goals when she reaches adulthood. It is our hope to try to help our fallen friend\\'s daughter in some small way as we still mourn his loss and celebrate his life.Read more about Brandon and Marley hereCamp Allen\\'s staff will be running/walking in the Bedford Memorial Road Race on May 21, 2016! All of the money that is raised will go towards the Ami Goodwin Adopt a Camper fund, to help support families that need financial assistance to send their Camper to Camp Allen! Our goal of $2,500 will help send two overnight campers and two day campers to Camp Allen. Thank you for your support throughout the years!For this race we are going to play a game for our theme. Our staff will have 5 minutes to find whatever they can around camp for a costume to run the race in! We will film the event on May 20th for everyone to enjoy!Camp Allen provides opportunities for growth, friendship, and fun for children and adults with cognitive and/or physical challenges in an outdoor environment located in Bedford, NH. It is unique in that the camper to staff ratio is 2:1 with 1:1 available for those with medical and/or behavioral challenges that require an increased level of care. In 2016 Camp Allen will celebrate 85 years of continual service. In the last ten years the number of campers served has tripled. In addition, new programs have been developed including vocational programs for individuals with disabilities, a weekend camp for families affiliated with the New England chapter of Little People of America, and camping experiences for adult survivors oftraumatic brain injury in partnership with the Brain Injury Association of New Hampshire. The Camp Allen experience is not only beneficial to campers, but their families and caretakers as well. The campers 6 or 11 day stay gives much needed respite for families who are often responsible for 24/7 care. They can relax knowing their loved one is in safe hands. For campers and families, the stay at Camp Allen cannot be replicated elsewhere and is an experience always to be remembered and cherished.

Madison and her brothers, Tyler and Alex, woke up, were dressed, and fed breakfast. I remember this day specifically; Alex wanted \"cheesy eggs\". I had been ahead of schedule that day, so cheesy eggs it was. Little did I know that this would be the last breakfast I would be preparing for Madison. This was a Tuesday, so Alex and Maddie went on a play date while their big brother was in school. Once home, it was naptime. Both kids were put down for their nap as normal. This is where our life changed forever. When it was time to get up, Aunt Yori (as Maddie called her) went upstairs and witnessed the most horrific site anyone could imagine. Madison was lying beneath her dresser. Unconscious. After several attempts by Lori and the paramedics, Madison was pronounced dead. Just that quick, our lives would never be the same. The only explanation is that Madison climbed her dresser. She was a climber. We would have never in a million years imagined that she was strong enough to pull her dresser over onto herself. Tyler was 12, and Alex was 4. All three of our children had used this dresser. In the coming days, it became abundantly clear... our story was not uncommon.Our daughter Madison died an untimely death that was VERY preventable. Our hope is to reach out to the millions of people who are unaware of the dangers in their homes. For the past seven years since Madison went to Heaven, we have incorporated different ideas that would help us reach the people outside of our inner circle. You may have seen me at local craft shows, sharing our story and giving out furniture straps. We also promote our storyusing Random Acts of Kindness to share Maddie\\'s Message to complete strangers. Over the past few months, I have realized if I want to continue to be able to share our story and provide free furniture straps in these types of venues and at this pace, becoming a true Non-Profit is necessary. This is where you come in. If you feel compelled to help, I would be so grateful. I intend to start the work to get our foundation incorporated and recognized by the state and federal government as a Non-Profit, therefore allowing us to raise money and in turn raise awareness on the this very PREVENTABLE tragedy.

Four years ago, I met my best friend and service dog in Milton, GA where I traveled to Canine Assistants  to get my dog. There was no cost to me or my family to go to Milton for the two weeks of training. My dog was sponsored by a group from Long Island who raised enough money to cover all of the expenses.Blaze gives me the security and support I need to make every day awesome and has become my best friend! I can\\'t imagine my life without her. We even got our picture on a Canine Assistants promotional video.Now, I want to pay it forward by teaming up with the help of Mickey\\'s Kids Charitable Foundation. I have set a goal here in Jefferson Township, where I go to middle school, to raise $5,000. When we meet our goal, we will combine our monies along with Mickey\\'s Kids Foundation\\'s $20,000 to place a service dog here in Northern New Jersey. Blaze and I would really appreciate it if you can help us reach our goal to help place a service dog with another disabled child right here in Northern New Jersey. Please donate here today, no amount is too small.Blaze and I thank you for any help you are able to give.****Blaze and I at White Rock School after we gave our \\'Coins for Canines\\' presentation to the students and staff. We were helped by Murray, the school\\'s therapy dog that we used to see everyday when I went there. (Blaze is asking her \\'dog friends\\' for help too)We are so saddened by the sudden passing of Bob. An amazing father to Logan, Parker and loving husband to Valerie. We would be grateful for donations to start a fund for them to give to a charity of their choice in Bob\\'s name.

Only 11 percent have access to clean water, so I want to help them out by sending Life straws. Life straws is a filtered straw that lets you turn up to 1,000 liters of contaminated water into safe drinking water. Since women and children have the responsibility to collect water they sometimes have to walk up to six hours in unprotected pools that are contaminated.Not only does the water affect their health, but it also affects the children\\'seducation and childhood. Many of us have no idea what it\\'s like to be thirsty since we have plenty of clean water to drink. Many people are dying because of the contaminated water, so help me MAKE A CHANGE!\\nI am hoping to reach this goal by April 7 or May 15, 2017.

We are now faced with the difficult decision of potentially closing the doors to a few of our most needed Clubs.The Boys & Girls Clubs of Volusia/Flagler Counties is now in its 23rd year of operation and thanks to the support of donors, sponsors, and partners like you, we are continuing to reach out to the youth and families that need us most. As we have shared with you in the past, we started in 1993 with nothing more than a need and a mission and have consistently built a greater foundation which now includes eight Clubs serving nearly 1,600 youth a year and more than 500 daily. Working families need a safe place for their children afterschool and during the summer that is affordable and makes a difference. Clubs fill this need and with 68% percent of our youth coming from single parent homes and 92% coming from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, we continue to make a difference with the childrenwho need us most.Our members are typically the youth whose families cannot afford the fee based alternatives for after school programs. In the tradition of Boys & Girls Clubs, no child is ever turned away due to inability to payTODAY, we need your help to replace these funds that our clubs depend upon to keep our Club doors open and to serve the youth of our community. Please join us as we endeavor to keep all of our Club doors open by making adonation of any size to meet our goal of $200,000 by July 31st.Club Sites:Daytona BeachPalm CoastDelandEdgewaterDeltonaLake HelenNew Smyrna BeachHolly HillMy name is Ralph Gousse, president and co-founder of Haiti Help Med Plus, a non-profit, 501 (c) (3) charitable, tax-exempt organization (FEI number 200263595) working in rural Haiti since 2003 to improve the quality of life of the poorest of the poor.

Jerry will be running and representing two causes. The first is Team Paws Chicago. TEAM PAWS is a charity racing and fundraising team, benefitting PAWS Chicago, a national model and the Midwest\\'s largest No Kill humane animal shelter. With TEAM PAWS\\' support, PAWS Chicago is able to rescue nearly 5,800 homeless pets each year, providing them with medical care, shelter and the care they need and deserve to be adopted by loving families. Additionally, PAWS Chicago provides over 18,000 free or at costs spay/neuter surgeries to prevent unwanted pets from entering the shelter system, helping to build a No Kill community. The second organization is of course, the Azumah Student Assistance Program. The Azumah Student Assistance Program (ASAP) is dedicated in making a difference in the lives of the youth in underserved Chicago communities. Incorporated in 2004, ASAP is committed to providing financial scholarship assistance for underserved students seeking private secondary education in the Chicagoland area in addition to supporting targeted educational youth programs. Since the inception, ASAP proudly has impacted the lives of several youth by rewarding multiple scholarships while providing various support to qualified youth programs annually. In 2010 the ASAP Foundation joined with Link Unlimited, an organization that provides educational services and mentoring to economically disadvantaged African American youth in the Chicago area. Jerrys Goal is simple, finish the Marathon and raise money for two great causes Team Paws and ASAP. Jerry needs your support.10 years ago I worked for a local Fire deptment that did the medical for a 65 year old race called the Alligator Enduro. Several years later I started to race dirt bikes with my sons, But this isnt about me. Its about hundreds of Dirt bike racers and the Medical crew that helps keep us safe at our races. The person in charge of this medical crewdoesn\\'t get paid to keep us safe he does it because he and his crew have a passion for the safety of Dirt bike racers all over florida. But, recently his teamscardiac monitor has broken and I\\'m trying to raise money to help keep my fellow races, friends and family safe in a traumatic situation and this broken piece of equipment is vital to LIFE SAFETY. I will name the race organization after I am given approval, but I\\'m starting this because the medical equipment company will sell a refurbished one for $2900 and the race season starts in August and I dont want to see someone die if the medical crew doesnt have a cardiac monitor that is functioning properly. Our race organization is non profit and says that we need to look at other means of raising money, so this is why I need your help. LIFE SAFTEY.Malnutrition related Vitamin A deficiency is a serious disease that can leave children blind or take their lives. If saving a child from this disease for one dollar sounds absurd, take 1 minute to let me tell you how you can do it.  SevaChild has developed a partnership with Vitamin Angels, a humanitarian organization that manufactures these micronutrients in Canada, and delivers them to us for distribution in India, cost free. And through our nationwide network of over 40 child aid organizations already serving tens of thousands of children in India, SevaChild is able to reach these children and administer these life saving micronutrients at the incredible cost of one dollar per child.The money pays to locate and register these children and to  administer these powerful time-release doses evert 6 months.  But we need your help to make this happen. Please consider $10, $25, $50, or more to help SevaChild meet their campaign goal to reach 20,000 children through this campaign before the end of the year.You\\'ll be making a big difference in the little lives you touch.To read more about SevaChild\\'s remarkable work in India, please visit http:// www.sevachild.org/what-we-do.php?con=int Thank you so much for your generosity of heart.My name is Gabriella Abel and I am a Senior at Western Michigan University studying Public Relations.

I can hardly believe she is gone. However I take great pride in knowing she has earned her wings, and gone home with her heavenly father. She is no longer worried nor stressed. \\nSakesha was a mother, daughter, sister, auntie, cousin, and devoted friend to many. She absolutely loved everyone!\\nI am asking everyone to please find it in your heart to help our family with her funeral arrangements , as she is without life insurance. Sakesha also leaves behind two young sons who will need assistance with there daily needs...\\nWe thank you from the bottom of our hearts for any donation you are able to make.\\nLove, \\n\\n\\nTanyaI am on a mission to raise money for the American Cancer Society. I don\\'t want to say, \"raise awareness\" because we are all already aware. Cancer does not discriminate. Cancer doesn\\'t care if you are young or old, rich or poor, where you come from, what color you are, if you have a family or are alone. Cancer is a silent monster that in some way has made an impact on most if not all of us. This past year my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time. We are so blessed because the doctors were able to catch it early. Not everyone is blessed with more time. So many people I hold dear are suffering because of cancer. What to do when someone you love so much is suffering? Pray of course. I prayed and prayed and this is what God has put on my heart. I\\'m going to do a 70.3 Ironman. The race is scheduled for July 20th in Racine, WI. I chose the amount of $3,000 because there are 3 events in a triathlon, so it seemed fitting. It also seems rather ambitious but regardless if I reach the monetary goal, I\\'ll be donating every penny to the American Cancer Society. I\\'m giving to the ACS because all different types of cancer wreak havoc on people\\'s lives and their families, not just one type. I will be paying for my entry fee, travel expenses, equipment, and all things race related. The money that is given here is going to the ACS, not to pay for anything for me personally. No amount given is too small. Even if you choose not to donate please spread the word and share this. If you or a loved one hasbeen marked by cancer, please share with me so I can pray specifically for them while I train and on race day. We are all woven into the same tapestry. I want to do something bigger than me. I want to do something that symbolizes hope, peace, and courage.\"But those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.\" Isaiah 40:31 http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/americas/ironman-70.3/racine.aspx#axzz2tixCibO5Because it\\'s only failure if you quit trying.I don\\'t like unfinished business. Last yearI decided that 2014 was ayear for a big challenge. I needed a goal that would scare and motivateme, so I signed up for theBuffalo Marathon. I wasplanning onrunning 26.2 miles and live to tell the tale. I was also determined to raise $100 for one of my favorite non-profits for each one of those miles. I worked hard to reach my goal, but unfortunately an injury (a fracture in my right heel bone) stopped me in the middle of my training (soon after my 16-mile run). I had to take some time off, and then I was only allowed to run very short distances every other day. And then I was able torun a little further each time, and then a little further. And I slowly got myself back on track.I am nothing if not determined (some might call it stubborn), so here I am again. The Buffalo Marathon organizers allowedme to defer my fee to this year\\'s race. I joined a Fleet Feet training group. I\\'m back to running five times a week. I am back to feeling strong and hopeful, and, yes, a little bit terrified. I am giving myself a second chance to do this, and I feel like I owe it to a Well-Fed World as well.Here is where you come in.On May 24th, I will get up and put on my running shoes and run for 26.2 miles. I will runto prove to myself that nothing is impossible, but I will also run in support of a wonderful organization called A Well-Fed World.As it says on their website, \"A Well-Fed World is a hunger relief and animal protection organization working with grassroots groups in the U.S. and internationally on feeding and food production programs.\" They provide vegan food to people in need and support animal-saving projects by partnering with national and grassroots groups in the U.S. and globally. You can learn more about their mission on their website, and please take a couple of minutes to watch the video below.It would be a great honor if you could support my efforts with your donation. No amount is too small; every single dollar counts. And all your donations, no matter how small, will support the great work that A Well-Fed World is doing. They will also keep me motivated through all the cold and snowy runs that I still have ahead of me.\\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this. And for your donation, if you decide to make one.A Well-Fed World: Feeding Families|Saving AnimalsOkay so I\\'m making this ultra-decadent, hyper-expensivetreat known as Eggs Woodhouse, traditionally prepared for self-involved superspy Sterling Archer by his faithful butler, Woodhouse. It doesn\\'t feel right eating such an opulent dishon camerawhen so many families are without the most basic necessities and comforts this holiday season - so I want to use this opportunity to generateresources foran incredible nonprofit, Hour Children. www.hourchildren.orgI had the pleasure of creating a video profile ofSister Tesa Fitzgerald, the Executive Directorof Hour Children, for a humanitarian prize she received in 2014. Hour Children is anot-for-profit agency that works primarily with mothers recently released from prison, and features a food pantry where members of the community can receive the help they need to provide nutritious meals for their families. Of the women assisted, 84% have been incarcerated for nonviolent offenses, and 60% for drug-related offenses, with many drug sentences related to mandatory sentencing rules. They are overwhelmingly people of color: 57% are African American, 27 % Latina, and 16% Caucasian. Only 40% had ever been employed  in any capacity  prior to their arrests and almost 65% had poverty level incomes. Of those who have held a job, 2/3 reported never receiving more than the minimum wage.My plan is to raise as much funds as possible, and use the sum total to buy nonperishable groceriesfor the Hour Children food pantry. Then I\\'m going to make a follow-up video showing exactly how your generosity has helped this great organization!The LEAP program is partnering with Beit Atfal Assumoud, a humanitarian non-governmental organization working among Palestinian refugee communities in Lebanon, to implement the Community Cares Dental Health Project. We need YOUR help!Beit Atfal Assumoud (BAS) currently has six dental clinics in operation within refugee camps that cater specifically to Palestinian refugee populations. These clinics deliver dental care that is often not available otherwise. These clinics are located in Beirut (in Shatila camp), in the North (in Beddawi and Naher El-Bared camps), and in the South (in Ein El Hilweh, Rashidieh, and Bourj El Shemali camps). LEAP will be working in 3 of these camps this summer.Need: In continuing the mission of ensuring dental healthcare to residents of the camps, and as a response to the ever increasing numbers within these camps, in particular considering the arrival of large numbers of Syrian and Palestinian refugees from Syria, BAS has requested additional support in expanding their outreach in the field of oral healthcare. GOAL: HELP US RAISE $5000.00 FOR DENTAL SUPPLIES! Checks: Make tax-deductible contributions to the LEAP Program. Write a check out to the WESPAC Foundation with \"LEAP-Dental Project\" in the reference line. The WESPAC Foundation is a 501c3 non-profit organization and is the fiscal sponsor of the LEAP Program.LEAP aims to provide : 1500 dental kits for each camp; 7500 dental hygiene kits in total 500 free checkups for each camp; 2500 checkups in totalBackground: Ensuring good oral health is an important part of improving overall health. However, worldwide, taking care of one\\'s teeth is often considered with less urgency than other health matters. Poor dental care habits can allow harmful bacteria to attack the gums and teeth resulting in gum disease and tooth decay. Moreover, if left untreated, there are increased risks of other illnesses affecting parts of the body. For example, gum disease can lead to bacteria moving into the bloodstream, causing infection. Such risks can be reduced and eliminated with good dental practices. Barriers to good oral hygiene are more prevalent in less affluent communities and include limited access to and availability of dental services, a lack of awareness about the need for care, cost and fear of dental procedures. The dental clinics established through BAS in refugee camps in Lebanon aim to remove these barriers, so that residents may have an increased opportunity at better dental health.Composite filling materials (frontal) Composite filling materials (posterior) Bonding for composite Itching gel for composite Composite finishing rubber Composite finishing burs Composite finishing gel Assorted diamond burs for cavity preparation Carboxylate cement Glass lonomer luting cement Root canal filling material Anesthesia Amp. 2% Impression materials Instruments Hand piece \"turbine fiber optic\" Light cure \"for composite filling\"We appreciate your help and support.Website:  http://www.leap-program.orgEmail: info@leap-program.orgAbout VAYLASince 2006, VAYLA has fostered the development and empowerment of youth in New Orleans East, through educational services, recreational activities, cultural enrichment, and youth-led community organizing in our city where youth have faced both natural and man-made disasters, we understand the great need to support youth with services as well as leadership development. Our approach allows us to address both the immediate needs of our youth while empowering them to work for systemic social change that will provide long-term benefits for the entire community. History and Past Accomplishments VAYLA serves Vietnamese, Latino, and African American youth through engaging their families to holistically address the issues and barriers they face, developing plans that help them meet their goals. As previously mentioned, we offer multiple services that focus on their education, health, and their leadership while fostering the development of relationships with a network of caring adults to further support them. For parents and guardians, we offer ESL, GED, and civic engagement classes that help them tap into a broader range of resources for their families. Through our work we have successfully served over 1,000 youth annually.  Evidence in how we have been able to shape the lives of young people can be underscore by the following examples of evidence-based practices: Raise Your Hand Campaign, Family Circle, and the Villages of the East Coalition. Goals and Strategies - Provide opportunities for families and individuals to learn, grow, develop, and become self-sufficient, productive citizens.- Provide effective advocacy services to families and individuals to empower them to advocate for themselves and actively engage and participate in community and society.- Provide social support services to families and individuals by promoting education, health, leadership, cultural, and generational connections.- Develop VAYLA to become a resource center where families and individuals can get the information they need to make effective decisions.Needs and Opportunities In the past few years, VAYLA has grown from a small staff of 4 to a team of 14. The staff expansion allows the organization to serve more youth in the community and more recently, with their parents. VAYLA is currently housed in one small central office area and is rapidly outgrowing the space.In order to continue our work, VAYLA is building a space where the entirety of the VAYLA staff team, as well as our young people and their family, can convene. Our hope is that the new community center will serve as a multi-functioning meeting ground for the community and staff, as well as a hub for all the programming, trainings and services. Donor\\'s ContributionsFunds for our new community center will be used for the construction and build-out in an already existing space specifically to serve the community and staff adequately and efficiently. Equipments, furnitures, and signage will also be purchase for programming and services provided to the community. Below are rendered images of how the funds will support build the new community center:- A Reception/Waiting/Common Area- 6 Staff Workstations - Dance Studio/Multi-purpose Room- Classroom - Computer Room- Conference Room (Rendered images: courtesy of Agoro Designs).Other rooms not shown: 4 office rooms, 2 study rooms, an equipment room, a copy/printer room, a youth staff work area, a kitchen/break room, 2 restrooms, and 2 closets.Donor\\'s Involvement and AcknowledgementsDonor\\'s names will be acknowledged in the new space. Larger contributions will have the options to name a room in honor of whom they wished. Donors are also welcome to volunteer at any of our events VAYLA host. Donor will be recognized at our grand opening of the new community center.Friday, June 19, 2015 --On Wednesday, June 17th the koa waa (canoe) Keahonui was destroyed in a traffic accident on its way to a regatta in Hilo. The Keahonui was a 45 foot long 400 lb koa waa that was loaned to Milolii Canoe Club for our inaugural racing season by the generosity of Uncle Bill Rosehill. It was valued at $100K. The driver that hit the canoe also destroyed the clubs trailer and the private vehicle that was towing it. The driver had no drivers license, no insurance and was driving a vehicle he didn\\'t own. Knowone was injured in the accident. Paa Pono Milolii is a small non-profit organization in Milolii that supports the Milolii Canoe Club and its 22 paddlers. We humbly ask for your help in replacing what we lost. ANY DONATION would be greatly appreciated. If you\\'d like to help, please consider a monetarydonation.All donations are tax deductible by the IRS.***ALL donations will go to the restoration of the Keahonui and the replacement of the clubs trailer and private vehicle***Paa Pono Milolii Inc. EIN:30-0209770 http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/29357711/update-koa-canoes-offered-to-club-after-theirs-was-destroyed-before-regattaMy name is Elliott James and I am an Army veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom. I am also an amputee as a result of my military service to this country. After being injured in Iraq, I experienced several years of difficultpersonal trials. However, through the help of other veterans,I pulled through. I stood up, dusted myself off, and discovered a new approach to life.  Today, I receive great reward and self-fulfillment from assisting other Veterans in their transition from military service to civilian life.  Many veterans are forever changed by experiencesin war. Therefore it is important for us (veterans) to change our old attitudes and ideasabout life back home.  Remember that veterans are not \"broken,\" they are changed. They are experiencing natural human reactions to inhumane experiences. Over the past few years I have lost friends and fellow service members to suicide.  When left unchecked, combat related traumatic experiences often lead a person down a path of sadness, depression, loneliness, despair and frequently, suicide.   The sad and devastating truth of today is that military suicide rates have risen to a disturbing level of approximately 8,000 service members and veterans per year- or 22 deaths per day. This is unacceptable to me. Often these tragic losses are due in part to a sickening lack of outreach, attention, and care that certain entities are charged with providing to our veterans. Even worse, these entities are funded by American tax dollars, yet the services they offer are minimal. (And untimely)There is obviously a problem. Whether you agree with the recent wars or not, veterans (and their families) are suffering in our country. They need our help. Together, we can find solutions if we are willing to work toward them. I\\'m willing to do whatever I can. On Nov 8, 2015 I will snap on my running prosthesis and run the Pensacola Marathon in Pensacola, Fl to raise resources for local and surrounding veterans. Running a marathon with one leg will not be an easy task. But I\\'m willing to suffer for a few hours to help those who suffer daily.    I deeply believe that there is an effective therapeutic value in one veteran helping another. One of my missions is to create a \"hub\" where veterans who have learned a new way of life can guide struggling veterans through their hardships. This kind of work costs time and resources. So I am reaching out to you all. I have personally walked my own path through the difficult years after serving in war. I know its not easy. But I know what it takes to make it. Ihave found my way back to a life thatserves and inspires others. Today, I just want to share that with other veterens. I\\'m asking you to please help me do that.  I encourage everyone to donate what you can.No amount is too small.  All proceeds will go througha local Pensacola 501 C-3 non-profit named POE In Action (PeaceOn Earth). I am a board member of POE. If you would like to use a donation for a tax write-off please contact me at ejames11@ymail.com.  Any funds collected will be used for directly assisting veterans by: paying for effective, immediate emergency crisis counseling that governmentveterans\\' servicesdon\\'t provide in time, helping relieve veterans\\'financial crises, employment consulting, temporary housing for homeless veterans, direct and close support with military to civilian transitioning, peer mentorship, and anything else the veteran needs to bring about a permenant life change. (Not a temporary bandaid).  If you would like to learn more about our non-profit or donate to us directly, again, I welcome you to contact me: ejames11@ymail.comIf we want suicide rates among veterans to drop, then veterans\\' issues need to stop being swept under the rug. We as a society need to step up and clean our side of the street by learning what we can do to adapt to the veteran as they learn to re-adapt to civilian life.  If you have ever read about the problems that veterans are facing today and have thought to yourself \"what can I do to help?\"- this would be a great place to start.  Thanks, EJCHAMPIONS OF BRIDGEPORT\\'S HISTORIC PRESERVATION is a group that has been formed to save the Downtown Palace & Majestic Theaters & incorporate it back into the fabric of the NEW Bridgeport. Currently we are exploring ideas like a mixed entertainment venue & an arts charter school, but nothing can be done until we take the first steps. Raising $5000 will pay for the $850 non-profit application fee, promotional materials, legal help if needed & many unforeseen costs. It is imperative that we raise enough money to be able to taken seriously when we approach the citywith our plans .... you see they own the building. Once our non-profit is established, we will be able to apply for grants, get sponsors & align ourselves with organizations & foundations who will become the funders. Without this initial grass roots effort & these donations, it is impossible. Please join us on this journey !!The Children\\'s Project was started with the hope of building and facilitating community centers, after school programs and residential homesfor children in developing communities around the world. We seek to create sustainable, self sufficient, locally run facilities that will benefit not only the children we care for, but also the surrounding community.This first year is going to come with a lot of costs. We are seeking investment from the people closest to us. While we wait for our 501(c)(3) status, we have to also wait for grants and major financial support. That is where you come in. Making an investment now will ensure a succesful start up, and a long term emotional investment in the life of our program, and the beauty of our mission.We don\\'t want to go to Africa, or Mexico, or anywhere else for that matter and \"fix\" anything. We want to go to these places, into their communities, and reach people on a level where they can do it themselves. Giving people the tools, resources, and education to know how to rise above poverty - and to give them the best future possible. We can make a difference, by partnering with peoplewhere they are at. We can empower humanity to rise above, and be better.Some details of our long term plans include, but are not limited to:- Residential homes for orphaned children- Infant care and young mother programs- After school programs featuring art, music, tutoring,etc.- Communityprograms featuring business, computers, health and wellness, andchildcare.- Medical screening and health evaluations- Counseling programs- Sports programsThat is just the tip of the iceberg. Anything is possible, and I believe this project can make a difference in these communities. If you are able to give, please do.

The 130 mph winds tore through the town destroying buildings and downing trees. The normally quiet backwater creeks surrounding the town poured over into the streets as the storm headed NNW leaving devastation in its path. Marine Discovery Center, a popular 501C3 nonprofit in the area that focuses on environmental education and outreach had planned well for the storm. The beloved tour boat, The Discovery, was dry docked in Ponce Inlet while all of the tour kayaks were lifted off of their creek side stands and brought inside the building. The FWC boat, used to survey flora and fauna in the area, was tucked away beside the kayaks and other possessions needing extra protection from the storm. The staff spent hours on Tuesday and Wednesday setting all of the aquariums to run on generators for when the power went out, covering electronics and important papers in plastic sheeting, and making sure everything was tied down, tucked away, and safe from the storm. The staff left to take care of their own homes, not knowing what they would come back to next week. The Artists\\' Workshop, another community driven 501C3 non-profit, shares the building with The Marine Discovery Center and has been offering art education since 1957 in New Smyrna Beach. The Artists\\' Workshop has long served the community by conducting art education classes for adults and well as youth including a very successful summer art camp for children. There are close to 350 members as well as numerous nonmembers who take classes in all forms of art instruction as well as workshops presented by visiting artists from other areas of the country.  After Matthew subsided, and people started returning to town, Marine Discovery Center and Artist Workshop staff discovered that their building had not fared as well as they had hoped despite their careful consideration when preparing for the storm. The building, site of an old high school, was missing more than half of its roof which lay in pieces and sheets on the ground. Much of the building suffered water damage, especially in the Marine Discovery Centers classroom, education staff office, and the gift shop. Staff and volunteers spent their weekend mopping up water, caring for the aquariums, and temporarily putting a tarp over the gaping holes in the roof weighed down with pieces of rubble. The Artist Workshop has been forced to cancel classes and workshops until the new roof can be installed due to water damage in four studios, their kitchen, and a library which houses several hundred art books.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimates show that the entire roof will need to be replaced to the tune of $150,000 and unfortunately insurance will not cover it. 10,000 square feet of roof will need to be replaced, and a donation of as little as $15 can help us repair one square foot of roof space. We are hopeful that you will help us reach our goal so we can replace our roof and continue serving our community as a leader in environmental education and outreach.Please consider donating today!I am one of three crew members for two runners crossing the USA on foot to raise money for the 100 Mile Club.

Table of Hope also offers special holiday meals, a clothing closet and mental health counseling. It is the only family-oriented community kitchen in Morristown that serves dinner. Unfortunately, on March 4, 2016, Spring Street CDC was forced to close Table of Hope due to lack of funding and, if we cannot raise at least $5,000 within the next two weeks, it cannot be re-opened. All funds donated will be used to purchase food, pay the cook, repair appliances and cover garbage and janitorial costs. Guests at Table of Hope are served dinner at their seats, encouraged to engage in conversation with volunteers, watch some TV and even take home some groceries. It would be a tragedy for Morristown and the less fortunate who live here to lose this unique resource.Table of Hope is a community kitchen and we are calling on the community to help us save it. On behalf of Spring Street CDC, Table of Hope and the thousands of people it has served, we appreciate anything you can do to help keep the Table of Hope in operation.Dear Friends:On June 20th I will begin a three-day 375 mile bike ride from Chicago to my hometown of Rocky River, OH in an effort to raise scholarship money for the Open Arms Home for Children, an orphanage in South Africa. There is some symbolism to ending my journey at my parents\\' home in Rocky River. I was blessed to grow up in a safe, nurturing home in a wonderful supportive community. There are so many children in South Africa who do not have that opportunity. Thanks to Open Arms, more and more children who have been orphaned by the AIDS pandemic will have the chance to be in a secure environment where they will be raised, loved and educated.My goal is to raise a minimum of $7,500 which will cover the cost of private school for two children for one year, but I know that with the support of my friends and family I can surpass that goal. If you would like to support me, just click on a reward level button, or for other denominations just click the Donate button on this page. It\\'s that easy.Thank you in advance for your generosity and support. I hope you\\'ll visit this page to track my progress on my ride and fundraising.

Currently, lost dogs that have been picked up by Animal Control within the city limits are transported to a temporary holding facility. Within a matter of days, if the dog is not claimed by its family or by a non-profit animal rescue organization, it will be put to sleep. \\nNicholas started the \"Lost and Found Cats and Dogs of Tyler, TX\" Facebook page in August of 2013 to help reunite families with their lost pets. With the support of the community displayed on the page and the encouragement of his family and new friend and fellow animal lover, John David Carrasco, plans to build the shelter and dog park have quickly developed. \\nNicholas\\'s family has donated twenty acres of land to the project between Tyler and Shreveport just off Interstate-20. Nicholas hopes the shelter will be completed in 2014.  Hundreds of dogs are killed each year in Tyler and it is his goal to put a stop to this!

Key members of the \\'Save Playland\\' movement, Deirdre Curran, Steve Vasko and Billy Lacerenza are moving on to the next step of helping beloved Playland Amusement Park in Rye, NY.Now, heading forward in a positive direction, we feel its the appropriate time to formally set up a long-overdue Friends Of group for Playland. The goal is to give a voice to Public, serve as a public oversight/input/advocacy group for the Park, and most importantly, serve as a voice for Playland, while doing fundraising for special projects and events that can help bring this historic landmark back to her glory.At a later date once we are set up we will be asking everyone to join as \"Members\" of \"Friends of Playland\", and will be looking for significant donations down the road. Currently, we are looking for a small, limited amount of funding ($3000.00) to cover filing expenses that will get the 501c3 off the ground. None of the money donated to *this* campaign is tax-deductible yet! WE ARE NOT YET SET UP AS A 501c3! This is the first step in getting us there. Once this initial goal of $3k has been met, we will stop accepting donations until the fund is legally set up. At that time we will be open to accepting more significant tax-deductible offerings. If any monies donated to this particular fundraising campaign are not needed for the initial filing, they will be transferred over to the FOP coffers once its all set up.Essentially, right here, you are sending *me*, Deirdre Curran, money to file the paperwork. Please donate whatever amount you can offer at this time to get us up and running!More detailed information on \"Friends of Playland\" will be coming shortly. Thanks in advance from \"Friends Of Playland\"! We look forward to serving as your voice and as an advocacy arm for the Park!Hi, Namaste, Shalom, As-Salaam Walaikum In the spirit of Ramadan, an Islamic holy month of prayer and charity, we would like to invite you to make a real measurable impact on those in need. \\nThe Palestinian Project covers fair trade, dental relief, and the support and maintenance of a school. \\nYou are probably aware of the political strife in the Palestine region, but for now, put what you have heard of the political strife to the side.

Fortunately, there was no loss or life or injury. The brave men & women of the Clark County & Las Vegas Fire departments responded and contained the fire. Unfortunately the damage was too great. After a recent school supply donation drive held at our office last week, we had many backpacks filled with school supplies that were intended for families who have children with Autism right in the Las Vegas Valley. All of them were lost. As the Las Vegas community has stepped up to show its compassion in the past, we hope it can do so again as we try and rebuild what we have lost. We may have lost our building, we didnt lose our passion to help those who need it. You can get more information on our website at  www.peoplesautism.org.#GFMtoSchoolWater is one of the most essential substances on the planet. Unfortunately, many do not consume the cleanest form of it. The public schools of Lebanon are experiencing severe contaminationin their water sources causing Lebanese and Syrian refugee children attending Lebanese public schools, to get seriously ill. Imagine if you had to worry about getting sick from something as simple as the water youre drinking at school. That should be the LAST thing a kid needs to even wonder about while seeking education. I have linked up with the Troy Rotary Foundation, a non-profit organization that connectedwith the 24 united Rotary clubs of Lebanon to provide clean water to the 1,535 public schools across the country. Over 200 public schools have received their filters in addition to hygiene training for students and staff members. My goal is to raise $5,000 in order to bring clean water to two more schools. Each public school has roughly 400 Lebanese students that attend the morning session of school hours, and 400 Syrian students that attend the same school in the afternoon. This means bringing clean water to 1,600 kids every single day. So it works a little something like this: ittakes $2,500 to replace old water tanks in each public school and to purify the water with new filters. Your donation would be directly going towards reaching this amount.There is not an investment like this that would give you such a rewarding return.  Truth be told, whenI initially signed upto run The Detroit Free Press/Talmer Bank Marathon on October 19th, I did it with the intention of fulfilling a task on my bucket list, but now it means way more than that. Its a cause where all of my passions collide: running, kids, Lebanon, and CLEAN WATER. So what do ya say? Join me on my quest for good and for change.From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for supporting this cause. Please feel free to contact me with questions or concerns.

It will be located on the Newington campus of the VA Connecticut Healthcare System. The 103-apartment community will be one of the nation\\'s first assisted living residences exclusively for aging veterans. Fees will remain affordable while veterans enjoy the same services and amenities associated with traditional assisted living homes (meals, medication monitoring, laundry, housekeeping, grooming, bathing, on-site/off-site activities, transportation, etc.).There are about 24 million veterans in the United States, and 3.5 million of these veterans are over the age of 65. Clearly, the need for assisted living is growing by the day. In Connecticut, there are 229,700 veterans and they make up 8% of the state\\'s population, and 23% of its homeless population. The bulk of these veterans were in service during the Vietnam era, and as they approach their 60s, 70s, and 80s+, their need for assisted living care quickly increases.According to the U.S. Department of Defense, over 14,000 Connecticut service men and women have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001; and there are nearly 9,000 active duty military personnel from Connecticut. As these men and women age, their need for assisted living will increase, particularly due to severe physical and psychological injuries.So how are we caring for our veterans who are seniors, and more so, our low-income veterans? How are we caring for veterans who are soon to become seniors or retirees? And how are we caring for veterans with disabilities who might only require limited support? Veterans Landing is the answer, the starting point, and most important, the model for communities across the nation. Your donation will be a first step in a larger fundraising campaign to support the development and building of this residence, which is slated for groundbreaking in 2015.Many veterans feel more at ease and at home when sharing their time with other military veterans. CRT\\'s focus is to help veterans stay as independent and vibrant as possible \" mentally and physically \" so they may enjoy life to the fullest. Veterans Landing will offer handicap-accessible studio or one-bedroom apartments, both with kitchenettes and private baths; a chapel; Internet caf; library; general store; computer lab; on-site/off-site activities, dining room; and many other supports and resources.We believe in a better retirement for military veterans. Do you? Please donate today. Our Veterans Landing Advisory Council, Trustees, and staff appreciate your commitment and help.

The education program matches Trenton\\'s young people with professional artist-mentors in playwriting, performance, spoken-word, and technical theatre classes.  Throughout the year, Passage provides after school arts programs through a number of local partner organizations, including (in recent years) Trenton Central High School, the Emily Fisher Charter School, the Boys & Girls Club, the Ellarslie Museum and the River City Community School.   The program is well known for its \"Playmaking\", a writing process which can be adapted to teen and pre-teen students, based on a model developed by New York\\'s 52nd Street Project.These students have gone on to do wonderful things in their communities.  Many of them have also graduated high school with honors and some have gone on to pursue their career interests with full scholarships as a result of their outstanding work with this program.  However this year, the program (generally funded by grants) has suffered a major blow.  It has lost a good portion of its funding -- 80%.  We\\'re asking you to please help us continue this wonderful outreach effort by donating just a few dollars and sharing this with your friends.Check out the attached video for their amazing story on \\'State of the Arts\\'.Julia was a classmate of my daughters.

Since I couldn\\'t find that perfect solution, I decided to build it with a team of passsionate experts who are as eager to revolutionize social finance as I am. Will you please help us reach the next milestone?\\n\\nWhat We DoWe help nonprofits with big goals receive the financial investments they need. Our platform also creates new possibilities for lenders and donors to connect their investment and social impact goals. If you haven\\'t already, please watch our short and fun animation video above to see how we do it.Why We Need Your HelpWe are ready to grow and bring more nonprofits onto our platform! With additional funding, we can proactively reach out and assist nonprofits with their funding plans. Please support us and share this with your friends and nonprofits!*** We appreciate every donation, no matter the amount. The more we raise, the faster we can expand and better our services. ***Benefits to Nonprofit BorrowersBy making funding more accessible, nonprofits can focus even more on serving the community than on fundraising. Benefits to Lender/DonorDonors desire choice and flexibility. Changing circumstances affect donors\\' abilities to give, but they want their nonprofits to continue to receive adequate support to continue their good work. LENDonate lenders fund a nonprofit through a loan and then have the opportunity to easily convert loan to donation anytime during the life of the loan enabling them to strategically plan their giving.Why Do Nonprofits Need to Borrow?Like us, sometimes there are emergency situations, such as a leaky roof or natural disaster recovery that needs immediate attention. A short-term, low-cost loan may be just the fix. Or a big project might come alongsay, relocating to a new building, where a loan is critical to its successful completion. Access to funds at competitive rates ought to be available to nonprofits whenever appropriate.*** Did you know nonprofits don\\'t just rely on donations and grants? As a sector, it actually earns over 70% of their revenue, e.g. tuition, ticket sales, etc. Also, 75% of them operate at or above breakeven.***Examples of Nonprofits We Funded1) An education nonprofit needed to pay deposits to vendors for an upcoming fundraiser. Rather than taking money from programs or putting it on credit card, they sourced a 2.9% interest bridge loan on LENDonate, along with $700 in donations. They ended up raising 6X what they borrowed!2) An arts nonprofit had a 13% interest bank line of credit, and we replaced it with a 3.6% interest only loan that was secured by a grant receivable. Additionally they received over $5,000 in donations during the campaign.Who We AreLENDonate is a committed team of people with over 100 years of collective experience in the financial and nonprofit sectors. Together, we are fostering the next generation of impact investing. We are here to power your mission.Our marketplace lending platform is a unique network where individuals, foundations, impact investors, banks and nonprofits leverage their collective power for the greater good.

For the past two years she has been fighting this dreaded cancer called leiomyoscarcoma, an aggressive cancer in the uterus area. She is in cancer stage 4 meaning it has advanced into several areas. She has lost her ability to use her intestines because the cancer is blocking her digestive movements. The cancer has also lodged into her hip, which causes extreme nerve pain. Because of this my mom is not able to walk very well and is in constant pain. She has lost her past two jobs because she has not been able to perform and cannot do jobs that require driving due to her pain medications. Without any support and income, my mom is in desperate need of additional funds for chemotherapy, alternative therapy, medications, and overall medical bills. She hopes to be set free of a financial burden while fighting this horrific disease. Every little bit will help tremendously.(All Donations are tax-deductible through the House of Neighborly Services- As Dianne\\'s Fund)'),\n",

So one evening 11 years ago, Joan M. Cheever decided to teach Daley, 13, and Austin, 10, a lesson. She made a big batch of spaghetti and chili, loaded it into the back of her SUV, and drove the kids around their hometown of San Antonio, TX, searching out the homeless. I wanted them to meet people who really had something to complain aboutbut didnt, she says.Food for the SoulJoan began accompanying a minister as he visited homeless encampments throughout the city, distributing hot, healthy meals she had prepared athome. The faces of hunger are not what youd expect, she says. Some people had been laid off from a good job, and before they knew it had fallen so far down that they couldnt get back up.CrowdsourcingA legal affairs journalist, Joan was soon devoting all her time to charity. She enrolled in the culinary arts program at St. Philips College, attending 8 a.m. classes several times a week. I am definitely not a morning person, she says. It was harder than law school. Joan founded the nonprofit Chow Train in 2011, tapping her social network of soccer moms, high school buddies and fellow board members of the San Antonio Public Library Foundation toraise $50,000 for a kitchen trailer and pickup truck. Some people write me a check just to shut me up, she says.Disaster ReliefNo sooner had she bought the trailer than a tornado tore through Joplin, MO, killing 161 people. Joan sprang into action, asking friends and relatives for donations to buy food and making the 600-mile drive to the ravaged city, where she served breakfast, lunch and dinner to survivors and first responders. Shes since traveled to LaPlace, LA, in the wake of Hurricane Isaac and to Brooklyn after Superstorm Sandy.Menu PlanThese days the Chow Train makes five stops in San Antonio every Tuesday. Local stores donate meat and bread, and area farms supply fresh fruits and veggies. The meals are three-course affairssoup, entrees like honey-ginger BBQ chicken and maybe Key lime pie for dessert. When Joan pulls up at events like the San Antonio Book Festival, shoppers can dig in as well. I ask them to pay what they feel the meal is worth, maybe a little more, she says. I rely on their goodwill. The 57-year- old also relies on husband Dennis Quinn, her BFFs and their spouses, and even her hairdresser to help cook and serve.But not everyone is happy about Joans efforts. In April, local police cited her for delivering her food without a permit. Joan, who cooked the meals in a commercial kitchen that she says had the proper permit, plans to fight her potential $2,000 fine in court.Clear-SightedJoans kids, who rolled their eyes during that first drive in 2004, have come to share their moms vision. Austin, now 21, was by her side after a tornado ravaged Moore, OK, in 2013. On a recent visit home from New York City, Daley, 23, accompanied Joan and three young cousins on a food run, answering their questions about the homeless. People tell me, I dont know where you find them, because I never see them,  Joan says. My response? Get on the Chow Train, and Ill show you.To make a donation, go to  www.thechowtrain.comKerry Thomas ( Caldwell ) was in severe accident Friday, July 10th while brewing her favorite beer (Obligatory Double IPA ) at  Edge Brewing Co in Boise, ID where she\\'s an award winning Brewmaster.                  Kerry is currently being cared for in the Burn Center at the University of Utah Hospital. She has suffered 2nd and 3rd degree burns on 30% of her body. She will require surgery and skin grafting. While it\\'s difficult for the doctors to know how long her recovery will take they are expecting her to be hospitalized through the month of July. Despite this hardship Kerry remains positive and looks forward getting back on her brew stand. It goes without saying this will be a financial hardship on the family. All of your contributions and warm wishes are deeply appreciated.My name is Christy Nixon. Andrea Ludden and I have been best friends since our freshman year at The University of Texas. I currently live in Austin, TX, and I\\'m trying to help out from far away.My dear friend, Andrea, her father, Rolf, her brother, Alex, and Pancho, their dachshund lost their home in the fires that swept through Gatlinburg, TN on Monday, Nov. 28. Everyone is safe, but their entire home was lost. Andrea hoped they would be able to find at least a few buried items in the devastation, but the house doesn\\'t even have a floor - they can see straight through to the basement. The fire left absolutely nothing. The family\\'s primary source of income is their jewelry making business, Earth and Sky Jewelry. While they were able to save a few pieces of jewelry, most of their inventory was destroyed. Andrea dedicates herself to helping others in her community through the local Rotary club. She told me that she is usually the one helping, she\\'s not used to asking for help. The family does have insurance, but they are doubtful it will cover everything they need to rebuild their lives. There is also no guarantee of when the insurance funds will become available. They have immediate concerns, like a rental house and basic food and clothing. They will also have long term needs, like rebuilding their house and replacing all their basic household items.Andrea is already taking steps to bring her community together in the tragedy. Despite her loss, she is already thinking of others, using her connections to start a community outreach program. The family is in immediate need of financial assistance for rebuilding and replacing their lives. They will probably still be rebuilding for a few years. Anything you can give would be greatly appreciated! Thank you, ChristyVery early Sunday (04/10/2016) morning, the Curtis-Veillux family woke to their house on fire. Thankfully for working smoke detectors, Steph and the five kids made it out without harm. Sadly, the house was an entire loss, along with everything inside andthe family dog Cotton. John, who was out of state at the time of the fire, rushed home to be with his family. This couldn\\'t have happened to a nicer couple and family.

Businesses in Lopes Square suffered a major setback when fire broke out in one building and spread to two others. Provincetown\\'s volunteer fire department along with Police, Rescue, EMS personnel and other fire departments responded. We are truly blessed to live in this wonderful community with an amazing fire department. Our community turned out to provide food, water and other needed supplies. We are working now to raise funds to help the fire department purchase more life saving equipment, help to provide support for those immediately impacted, and funds to establish a emergency food canteen/rehab unit that will provide food, water and aid to firefighters during a fire emergency on the Lower and Outer Cape. The Provincetown Business Guild, Provincetown Chamber of Commerce and Provincetown.com are working together to help our friends, neighbors and first responders.This GoFundMe campaign was setup by Steven Roderick, a partner in provincetown.com in conjunction with the Provincetown Business Guild and Provincetown Chamber of Commerce. Steve Roderick also serves as Treasurer of Lower Cape Ambulance Association, a 501c3 public charity organized in the state of Massachusetts. Steve Roderick has no relationship with any of the other organizations or beneficiaries. These 3 organizations came together to raise monies that would benefit the following: individual employees who were directly affected as a result of the Memorial Day Weekend Fire in Lopes Square Provincetown (Surf Club Restaurant/Tatiana\\'s, the Coffee Potand the Red Shack; the Provincetown Fire Association on behalf of our volunteer fire department; and Provincetown\\'s other first responders (Provincetown Police Association, Provincetown Rescue Squad & Lower Cape Ambulance) all of whom were present at the fire.A representative from the Chamber and one from the Provincetown Business Guild along with Steven Roderick will review requests from all of the affected employees. Lists of employees will be provided by each of the employers. Each employer has already been contacted and each employer has indicated neither they nor any family member who may work for that needs funds. So all of the employee portion will go directly to their employees. The committee of 3 will then determine the percentage to employees and the percentage to first responders. At that time, checks will be written and distributed to all beneficiaries. Employee checks will be delivered to each employer for distribution. Checks to the first responder organizations will be sent directly to each organization at their legal place of business. A report will be generated indicating the total amounts raised by the campaign, will list expenses charged by GoFundMe and the credit card processing fees, the list of each check and amount distributed. No monies will be kept by Steve Roderick, provincetown.com, the Provincetown Chamber of Commerce nor the Provincetown Business Guild. Copies of reports will be available for review once the campaign has ended. Note: no personal information about employees will shared per Massachusetts Written Information Security Laws. Questions can be directed toSteve RoderickWe have set up this fund to help with Mary and Emily Barkes memorial and to help with expenses for her daughter Sarah and her hunsband Billy who survived the fire. They have lost everything. Their family required two incomes and now they have one. Please make a donation. Anything and everything will help. If you can\\'t give please say a prayer for Sarah and Billy.

The hope is that the citizens will be able to legally overturn the Countys approval of this text amendment.The citizens are not against development! The citizens are against the County putting urban development in an area that cannot accommodate that population growth. The County did not extend urban services to the newly zoned high-density lands. Instead, the people of the area will remain with rural services and infrastructure that must now support urban population (e.g. Rural roads to support urban traffic. Delayed emergency response times. Limited police to service the area. Limited firemen to service the area. Limited public services for special need populations. Etc.) The quality of life for citizens in this area will decrease! Additionally, the area currently serves as a major wildlife corridor for the FL black bear and other protected species. The habitat for these animals will be destroyed and they will have no where to go.Please donate $5, $10, $15, $20, $30to help fund this community fight! All donations are used towards the legal fees.

Always seen with a smile on their face and lending a helping hand. Sadly, sometimes bad things happen to good people. Last night Kattie & Shane went skating to the beach and as they were leaving Shane was struck by a motorcycle. This happened on the 16th block south on A1A, just up from their home. He was airlifted to Halifax and endured hours of surgery for major trauma all over his body. He has many broken bones, almost lost his right leg and had internal bleeding. He is now stable and in an induced coma. Shane is the owner and operator of Platinum Pool & Patio Screening LLC. He and Kattie have two young boys and Kattie works part time as a CNA. With the situation they are in the last thing Kattie needs to worry about is their finances. But the sad truth is no matter the situation, bills do not pay themselves. I ask that everyone please say a prayer and if you can please make a donation. No amount is too small. I believe in our community and I know that together we can help the Kitchens family, not only financially but by having faith as well. Please share with your friends, ask people to pray for them with you. Shane and his family have a very tough and long road ahead of them but they are strong people and with our support I know they will be just fine.Rudy Blanco was only 8 years old when he left his home behind in Cuba, stealing away on his grandfathers shrimping boat with his parents and sister during the Mariel boat lift in 1980.They landed in Key West, then headed to Miami, where his grandfather and uncles lived. They got their green cards but spoke no English when they arrived in America.They lived under a bridge in Miami for a year before earning enough cash to afford a small apartment. His dad worked for a condo association while his mom cleaned houses and hotel rooms.In the Keys, he met and married the woman of his dreams, a pretty Taylor County girl named Shelly Ferguson. They went on to build a life together, start their own small business and raise their son and daughter. On May 9th however, after reporting for his annual check-in with ICE in Tallahassee, Rudy was taken into custody without any forewarning. Rudy is currently sitting in a detention pod in Wakulla County awaiting deportation back to Cuba, a consequence of a scrape with the law 20 years ago, coupled with the policies of the new president.Their son Noah, a master welder who graduated from high school last year, is helping to keep the familys remodeling business going while his daughter Hannah, who serves in the U.S. Coast Guard, flew home to help however she could but the family worries how theyll make ends meet if Rudys away much longer.The Blancos have hired an immigration attorney, and theyre selling off assets to prepare for whatever comes next. Shelly is meeting with as many people as she possibly can to plead his case. It is evident that Rudy has an exceptional character based on the letters that have been written. He is always willing to help and recently during Hurricane Hermine, he volunteered his time and money helping the victims. He went house to house at his local beach helping residents salvage what they could. But the family is stuck in limbo. Theyve been told Rudy could be detained for anywhere from a few months to a couple of years and beyond the emotional devastation, financial costs are accumulating. The money raised will go to help cover the travel expenses to Wakulla (one hour away, where he is being held,) and to support the family without Rudys income. *This gofundme was created for Shelly & Rudy Blanco by myself (a family friend) and all proceeds go directly to them. Thank you all for the generous donations and prayer during this time.Hey friends,\\n\\nI am in a crazy situation where I am being charged $100 a day to have my car in tow yard on top of $1500 in parking violations, a current $700 tow fee, and my main source of income being driving my car.Basically, to see my car again I will have to pay for more than two thousand dollars and I have no idea what to do. So a couple of people suggested I create this and see how many people would be willing to help.#FreeTheCarMatthewThree innocent children were saved from their abusive parents. The five year old has suffered physical and emotional torture. Let\\'s raise some funds to help these kids get the medical and emotional support they need and deserve.I do not know this family but my wife and I work in the human services field and feel we can personally do more for those who suffer abuse. My wife has Fillmore County contacts whom she can directly hand donations too at the end of this campaign. We intend for the funds to be used however the kids need and at the discretion of their social workers or who is in charge of their care.We do not intend to keep any of the funds for future purposes. This campaign is devoted solely to the children in this case.Sadly, the wonderful Doucette family had a house fire yesterday and lost everything, including their loving pets. Devin was taken to the hospital with 2nd degree burns and is out now recovering. Thankfully no one else was in the house so no other injuries. This family is just now starting on their long road on trying to get their life back. Barbara and Moe are avid members of the Old Orchard Beach commumity and are ALWAYS helping in any way they can. So many of us are hurting for them as no one deserves to lose everything. I am doing this so we can get them some clothes, food, place to stay, etc. Anything you can do would be more than greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your generosity!!!My name is Jack, and I\\'m a father of two young boys whom I love dearly. I worked as a public high school teacher for 15 years and loved it, but an injury on the job has left me unable to work. I am now at the point where I may soon be forced to move away from my sons, and it breaks my heart.In May 2007 an extremely brutal fight broke out in my classroom, and when I attempted to intervene , among other injuries, one of the two students picked me up and threw me across the room to the floor. Officers came in shortly after and took the students out of the room, and I thought I was fine, though definitely banged up a bit. I went home and rested that night, but the next morning I took two steps and hit the floor: I was in unbearable pain and unable to walk. The young man had crushed three discs in my spine. A little over two and a half years and 13 procedures later ended with having an \"Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion\" - a fancy way of saying that I have rods, screws, titanium cages, and cadaver implants in my lower spine. It was so severe that the surgeons had to go in through my abdomen from the front, lay my organs outside my body, and literally hammer and chisel out the damaged material from the inner part of my back. I was on medical leave for almost 8 months. My surgeon was phenomenal, and I can walk now, but the damage was so severe that I have permanent nerve damage in my lower back and left leg. I am always in pain, though the level varies. After continuing to work for 7 years after the initial injury, I have reached a point where I can not stand for any length of time, cannot walk long distances, cannot sit for any length of time, and can\\'t even sleep much - as whenever I move the slightest bit to get comfortable, I feel a nerve pinch and am awakened by the pain. I simply can\\'t find a position that doesn\\'t hurt.My spinal surgeon says that he\\'s done all he can do, and I will be in pain for the rest of my life. I didn\\'t sue the school - at the time, I thought it was best for my students not to take more funds from a county that was already faltering (typical teacher, I guess, thinking of the students first). Besides, the county agreed to cover initial medical fees and I got lots of \"We\\'ll take care of you\" sentiments, though none in writing. Since I waited over two years, I can no longer make a claim.As if that weren\\'t enough, in 2010 I had the first of 15 eye surgeries for a bizarre series of retinal detachments in both eyes. I am now completely blind in my right eye, though an excellent retinal surgeon has helped me maintain almost 20/40 vision in my left eye.I am thankful and grateful to still have as much vision and mobility as I do, but the fact is my level of pain and lack of mobility has left me unable to work. I filed for disability, which I\\'m told I will eventually receive, but it has been over 17 months and my retirement savings, as small as it was, has been completely used. I am at imminent risk of becoming homeless, I have unpaid medical bills for my vision, have no insurance, and will be unable to support my children in less than a month. I found out last week that my disability hearing is at least 14 months away!I may be asking for too little, to be honest: my goal is to be able to pay rent and utilities for at least a few months. I resisted coming to Go Fund Me for a long time, because I\\'m so used to pulling my own weight, but I\\'m no longer in a position to do so. I have gotten to a point where I\\'m desperate for help. Any help will be greatly appreciated by both me and my sons.Thank you!The Ta\\'ase Family is one that is near and dear to so many. Their family home caught on fire and it has been considered a total loss.The family of 9 will have to start over completely, from basic necessities like shoes and clothes, to furniture, and everything else found in a home.For people who constantly give so much of themselves, let\\'s return the favor by helping them.Update -\\n\\n\\nHello all -\\n\\n\\nTony and I haven\\'t done an update here on our GoFundMe in about 5 months. We kept thinking that any moment now, we\\'d be triumphant successes rising from the ashes of defeat, with only a singed tail feather or two. Unfortunately, that day has not yet come, although we still remain convinced there must be a pony in the towering pile of poop.\\n\\n\\nWhen last you heard from us, we were just about to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure on our house...and that happened!! Yea!! And so for the last few months we have been (just barely and with help) making those payments, our first mortgage payments, and our other bills. We cut our expenses, including giving up Tony\\'s studio space. I continued to look for a job, and we put our efforts into running Tinplate Studios as well.\\n\\n\\nThen...the darkness came...or more specifically January and...job prospects withered and died and the business tanked. I blame That Man...you know the one. And we need to make our bankruptcy payment next week, and the coffers are empty.\\n\\n\\nNow...as I said...all is not lost...not absolutely...not yet. I have two jobs circling out there that I really truly believe are close to offers *and* we have our biggest show coming up in two weeks - Emerald City Comicon. Finding enough money to buy supplies for that is, unfortunately, an issue as well.\\n\\n\\nSo here we are again. On your doorstep, hats in hand, asking for help. We understand this is not a sustainable lifestyle choice...to keep doing this. We are already looking into selling the house - a tricky prospect while in bankruptcy, but must find a way to survive just a bit longer to give that a chance to succeed as well.\\n\\n\\nAs you well know...we have stuff for sale!\\n\\n\\nThere are many fun new things up on  www.tinplatestudios.etsy.com\\n\\nThere are also starting to be things up on my Etsy shop -  www.dejaviews.etsy.com\\n\\nNothing in our house (vintage collectibles! steamy costume bits! shop fixtures and housewares!) is safe from a priced-to-sell-tag and we\\'ll try to get those up on Facebook first just as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\nWe are humbled and grateful for your support. Your good wishes shine a light in what seems to us to be overwhelming darkness and you give us strength to go on.\\n\\n\\nAnn and Tony\\n\\nHello friends, family, acquaintances, fans, and kind strangers \\n\\n\\nYou last heard from us through this venue about 6 months ago, when so many of you, so generously, helped us by providing funds to allow us to pay some bills, catch up on our first mortgage, and put a temporary tarp over what was left of our roof. (That\\'s where the initial $4,885 went...and why it says we want such a big honking number - we\\'re trying to raise $5,000 now.) I got some temporary contract work, we did a few shows for Tonys business, Tinplate Studios, and we squeaked along until now. What we were not able to do was make a couple of past due payments on our second mortgage, and the mortgage holder, Washington State Employees Credit Union (WSECU), is now foreclosing on our house. The foreclosure sale is set for September 9th, in less than 2 weeks.\\n\\nWeve been working with the Urban League for the last several months to try and negotiate some sort of modification with WSECU, but they have been unwilling to do so. Because they are a credit union, they are not bound by law to do Foreclosure Mediation. Although they told us, in 2012, and again in 2015 that they had written off the loan, and did not seek payment from us during that time, we did start a reduced payment plan with them in late 2015, and we fell 2 -3 months behind on that. Were current on our 1st mortgage.\\n\\n\\nWSECU now appears to be willing to possibly consider making some arrangements that could postpone or forestall the sale of the house. They want money right away for their legal fees and towards our arrears, and then perhaps they would be willing to make arrangements for the balance. They want the money tomorrow. We dont have it. Its possible we may be able to negotiate a few more days.\\n\\nSowhat were hoping for is to raise enough money to buy us some time. We dont want to lose our home  I grew up in this house. My parents bought the house in 1947, and I raised my family, the third generation of Ravenna residents, in my childhood family home. I even wrote a book about the neighborhood, with a number of pictures of the house! \\n(Check out my Author Page .)\\n\\n\\nHeres a bit of background on us and our situation -\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'ve found your way here, you probably know us (or at least had a passing moment of thinking who are the dashing duo in the great hats?!)\\nbut you may not know our current situation. Myself (Ann Wendell) and my husband, Tony Hicks, are romantic/creative partners in adventure, living in our 100 year old house in the Ravenna neighborhood of Seattle. We met online about 13 years ago, and after falling madly, truly, deeply in love, decided we should meet. Tony came to visit me in Seattle and never left (as a native Seattleite, I was allowed to sponsor him...even though he\\'s from California.) I\\'m an author, local historian, and recruiter/business researcher and Tony is an artist, creating sideshow gaffs and cryptozoological wonders, natural (and unnatural) illustrations and sequential art, disturbing jewelry, and Steampunk bodgery as Tinplate Studios . \\n\\nSo...here\\'s the scoop. We\\'ve gotten ourselves into a bit of a pickle. We have woken up to smell the cat food in our bank account. We\\'re broke...flat out busted...skint...tapped out...poor as church mice, as Job\\'s turkey, as a cabdriver in Venice. How the heck did this happen?!?! Well, the last 2 years or so have been filled with our very own Series of Unfortunate Events (and frankly we were already in a pretty deep hole due to such fun life experiences as the aftermath of a messy divorce, unemployment, and cancer.) We were unprepared for the big blows - the unexpected loss of my job and Tony\\'s diagnosis of Sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease. He was flat on his back for months, and I was taking care of him. Unfortunately, he is still not back to being completely healthy, and he struggles every day to have the energy and stamina to continue working. And thus began the cascading Dominos of Doom where part of your roof blows off, your 80 year old furnace needs repair (and somehow to be filled with oil before the cold hits), as does your car (which is how you get to shows where you could vend and make money...if you could...but you can\\'t), the utilities and electricity still need to be paid, and even though my job search is in high gear, offers are just not pouring in.\\n\\n\\nWe are lucky to be covered for healthcare (Thanks Obama!!) so we still have a steady supply of antidepressants coming in. But we now face the prospect of literally having no place to live. This is how we would use the money were asking for now  staving off the foreclosure sale of our house. If you can help us keep a roof over our heads (even though it is now a large plastic tarp) for just a bit longer until we have steady money coming in, it would mean the world to us.\\n\\n\\nOther ways you can help -\\n\\n\\n1. Buy things from us! \\nTony\\'s Etsy shop is  www.tinplatestudios.etsy.com . (It may be several weeks processing time, but he promises it\\'ll be well worth the wait.)\\nAnn\\'s Etsy shop is www.dejaviews.etsy.com (This will soon be filled with treasures such as vintage hats, clothes, jewelry cocktail sets, tea pots and salt and pepper shakers.) You can also buy Anns books from her directly (Images of America: Seattles Ravenna Neighborhood, and Images of America: Frederick & Nelson.)\\n\\n\\n2. Let Ann know about job leads! \\nHere\\'s my LinkedIn profile to get an idea of what I can do -  www.linkedin.com/in/annwendell .\\n\\n\\n3.

All the wonderful things you already do! Thank you so much for all your support!\\n\\n\\nKeep those Facebook pictures of baby hedgehogs rolling in. We need them now more than ever!My name is Shauna, I have been friends with Jessica Padgett for 20 years. We grew up across the street from each other and a few years ago became neighbors again after we both bought our homes from our parents.Jessica Padgett33, of Whitehall, PAwent missing on 11/21/2014. Sadly it was discovered that she was a victim of homicide. Herthree children were everything to her. This fund will aid the family in caring for their basic needs duringthis difficult time. Her husband and his mother are the only people that will be able to make withdrawals from this account. There is a separate password needed to make the withdrawl. Our hearts are broken with this loss but we want to do everything we can to help her family take care of these kids. The family wishes to keep the children\\'s faces out of the media so their picture was not posted. Thank you for your donation! http://www.wfmz.com/news/news-regional-lehighvalley/da-missing-lehigh-county-woman-found-dead-stepfather-charged/29943728To my Theta Xi brethrenLast week I had the honor to reconnect with pledge brother Aaron Garrett, BE 554. Aaron called to let me know that he had been in a car accident and wondered if he could have his car towed to my house. Of course, and thus was the beginning of 4 days underneath a car that had certainly seen better days. Aaron\\'s \\'94 Toyota Camry had bent/busted three rear suspension tie-rods, cracked his windshield, popped his hood and trunk out of alignment, banged up the rear quarter panel, and blew two air bags--which incidentally, knocked him back so hard that it broke his seat and must now be propped up. Needless to say, getting the tie rods out was going to be a bit of a chore, but the car really is toast. Oh, and by the way, I was at work most of the time, so he did most of the car work himself.After going to the local salvage yard (auto stores don\\'t carry this stuff for 22 year old cars), we managed to get the tie-rods and re-install the new/old parts. We were both pleased to find that the car was still drivable and that there were no other discernable problems. A day later I followed Aaron back down I-5 to his home in Davis and we parted ways.I cannot tell you what it has meant to get to spend so much time with an old friend. The real blessing, though, was talking about our lives and sharing what we had learned. Despite different experiences, the conclusions we discovered about this world are so similar.If you do not know, please let me share with you Aaron\\'s situation. Almost 30 years ago Aaron was in a horrible industrial accident, where he was basically crushed and barely survived. He has since spent the majority of his adult life on heavy pain medication and lives on disability payments. Our once hard-working, strong friend has quietly lived his life in immense pain and incredible humility. Aaron would never complain about his situation, nor ask for this help, but it is clear to me that he certainly could use a hand right now.Our conversations meandered about life, our past, God, and the place where each of us is in our life. I could clearly see that every waking moment was a struggle for him and am inspired by his humble perseverance. Imagine working underneath a car while your body is screaming to just maintain some semblence of normality.They really don\\'t make TX men any better. Not once a complaint, not a whine about his struggle, not a request for any kind of handout. \"It is what it is\", a phrase we both seemed to recite repeatedly. Aaron could easily be angry about his situation. Rage about how this life has been so unfair. Be miserable in the ridiculous amounts of pain meds he has to take--just to be able to get up in the morning. I quickly realized that his stay with me was a greater blessing to myself, than to him. I can help you fix your car, but I don\\'t believe I can inspire you to live a life in testament to God. I hope (and pray) that we will be able to rally around our brother and do something that will at least help him maintain his mobility. Aaron would never consider asking any of us for money, it\\'s just not his way. I do know that he is safe, has a place to live, and with his limited means, continues living a life of real honor. Any money donated will go to helping him buy a new car and living expenses.YITBTom Lowe, BE 555My name is Carlo Bellario I am a professional stand up comedian/actor.. I am here on Go Fund Me today for assistance with a incident that occurred to me on November 16th of 2015.In between comedy gigs I sometimes take on acting roles. I joined a group on Facebook that posts casting calls. So I saw a post for a movie called Vendetta Games looking for henchman type bodyguards for a drug dealer. So I submitted for the role and got casted. I was to report to the set in Woodbridge N.J it was a small independant film produced by a college student. There was no pay but I was to receive a copy of the film & credit on IMDB... So the scene called for me and another guy to be in a simulated car chase scene and I was to be shooting at the car in front of me. So we filmed the scene in a residential area of Woodbridge, and as soon as we returned from the shooting the scene , the set was surrrounded by police cars. Apparently residents in the neighborhood phoned the police and told them that there was a two guys driving around waving a gun out of the window. Now I understand that residents did not realize we were shooting a movie and understand why the police were called, and I cannot fault the cops either due to the fact that they are getting a call and have no idea what the situaution is.When the police arrived we attempted to explain to them that this is a movie shoot, and that the gun was a prop. After several minutes of questioning everyone the police had determined that the producer & director neither had a film permit nor did they have a permit for the prop gun which turned out to be an air soft pellet pistol. I was the only one arrested that day for possesion of a handgun, and now face up to 5 years of prison,. I spent 4 days in jail at Middlesex County Jail until my family was able to post bond for me. The producer of the movie told my family that he would indeed bail me out but when he found out the bail was 10,000 he declined to help and left me there and left my family frantic as to how to arrange bail and get me released. He ignored my family\\'s phone calls & subsequently my family had to lay out over 4,500 thus far for the bail bondsman and other expenses.So I am humbly asking that anyone who is in the entertainment industry, to please contribute as little as $1... I understand that this time is tough for everyone financially. But if you are unable to donate, please consider sharing it with others who you may feel can help, so i can accquire the necessary money to retain an attorney and to recoup what members of my family have given thus far, and the expenses incurred by the bailbondsman that have left me and my family financially distraughtAs actors we all want to work and get ourselves exposure but we also need to hold the industry to higher standard as well and serve as a valuable to not let what happened to me happen to other actors.I have several attorneys who want to help and see me through this situation but it will involve a lengthy legal process which will incure a huge amount of fees which I completely understand,.I am highly embarrassed that I am here asking for help like this but I am out of options and my friends, family, and peers are my last hope.If anyone knows of an attorney who is willing to take the case PRO BONO please contact me.Due to the nature of this charge I cannot leave the state or travel as I often do for my comedy gigs.Thank You for taking the time to read my story.THANKS & GOD BLESSCarlo BellarioJust a quick Edit... We are now using any extra money for Dexter to repair his house, get him a safer vehicle, remove some very large overgrown trees, and get him Central A/C for his house. If you still donate money it is more than welcome as we will use all of this up on those items for Dexter.On June 16th, 2016 \"DJ\" - Dexter Johnson was driving down Avenue of the Cities in Moline and the tailgate on his truck came undone. His commerical mower fell out on to the road and he realized this a couple of blocks away. He then turned around to go back and get it and when he got back to the area near 48th St. his mower was gone.\\n\\nDexter is in real need of more than just a mower he needs a front door, bathroom toilet redone, and his truck is constantly failing and needing to be fixed. Any extra money beyond the mower will go to these other things he desperately needs.\\n\\nI have always helped Dex get the important things he needs, but I have also been asked by many to let them help Dex in some way. Well this is that chance to help him, I will make sure he gets the things he needs the most and keep people informed of what we have been able to do for him.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know who Dex is please take a look at this video about him:\\n\\n https://youtu.be/HvRY_L2DGBU\\n\\nThank you for considering Dex...\\n- TC\\n\\nTerry ChristopherThis is Lucy and Hugo, they are siblings who have Spinal Muscular Atrophy! They use an electric wheelchair to get around. Each chair weighs over 300 pounds and they need a special vehicle that can be equipped to fit not only one chair but BOTH wheelchairs to get around. Recently Lucy and Hugo\\'s WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VAN got STOLEN! They need the van to get to doctors\\' appointments and for Hugo to go to work! Using the CDT Paratransit service is not a reliable source for Hugo to get to work, since they\\'re usually not on time, and this would make Hugo late for work on a regular basis. Using public transportation is difficult during the winter, since they get really cold and their muscles tense up. They already have bad circulation and the cold makes their hands stiff which makes it hard for them to drive their own chairs after a while. This can be dangerous when crossing the street to get to and from the train/bus stop. The family is in complete shock that their van was stolen. The van was specially converted to fit both wheelchairs by having the two middle seats and the passenger seat REMOVED. This is presumably a reason that the culprits stole the van due to the spacious interior to commit other illegal crimes. Whatever reason anyone had is completely inexcusable and WRONG, but now Hugo and Lucy are left stranded. These type of vans can easily cost $35,000+.The van was found by the police but it was completely burned. Hugo\\'s Dad said it looked like they set off a bomb in the middle of it. The windows that didn\\'t break were smashed in with bricks. It\\'s crazy to think about. Hugo\\'s Dad said he felt like crying when he saw it as he couldn\\'t believe that people could be so cruel.Hugo and Lucy did nothing to deserve such a heinous thing to happen to them. They both have the kindest and generous souls you will ever meet. Please donate what you can to get Hugo and Lucy back to the independence they once had!Thank you, MoiraWe are hoping to extend some extra kindness to help the Albitz family, Jon, Aly, Nelly and Myles, who lost their house last night in a fire, as well as their beloved dog Belle, who didnt make it out of the house. Everyone is ok but their house is nonsalvagable, as are most of their possesions, and the kids have lost all of their personal belongings, toys, and clothes.While many of their losses will be unreplaceable, we felt donations from others could be extremely helpful to assist in easing some of the initial and immediate financial burdens of this tragedy. If you would like to help and are unsure how, a donation of any size will certainly extend love and support to these amazing people and help them to begin to slowly rebuild. Thank you for the kindness in your hearts.Emmas futurePlease read our story and help us share Our gofundme page Emma is a 1yr old baby girl who lost her mother at the age of 29. Emma needs your help for her future. Everyone is asking how they can help....by sharing our gofundme page and for your support ,love & generosity so emma can have the things that she needs in her future , With the love & support of her family who will be caring for Emma as God has called her mommy to be her angel from above ! May you all please help Emma and family to make this possible . I want to thank you all for reading our story & share our gofundme page .Thank you all My name is Bill Smith and I am a chef in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. I have many friends who are immigrants. Some of theses people are employees, some are former employees. Almost all of the families have mixed documentation. They are worried that loved ones may be deported. I want to be able to put people on planes if they feel that they need to leave the United States. I\\'m not sure exactly how much we\\'ll need and I\\'m not sure when I will need it. This is a contingency fund. There are eight families that I know that could be affected. Thirteen children under the age of 16. I have gotten everyone\\'s travel documents in order. I\\'m afraid that there may not be much notice so I want to be ready to go at any time. I might also need to help with living expenses before people go if people are suddenly out of work. There may also be legal expenses. I thought if there was any extra cash, I would divide it up among these families if they in fact leave. Most of them have been here so long that they no longer have homes in the places where they came from.My plan for using the money is this: If I buy plane tickets, I will do so on line using my own accounts. If bills need to be paid , I will write checks, again from my own account. I will keep careful record of all the expenditures, that all donor will be welcome to examine. If everyone leaves and there is any nmoney left, I will just give it to the families, probably by sending them money orders since they will by then be back home.Madie Hart\\'s bright smile, warm personality, and unwavering love for others were met with tragedy a few days ago when she was horriblyhit by a car.Madie passed away at 7:21 a.m.on March 30, 2017.

Since then they have had to overcome MANY obstacles to re-build and get back into their home. They have moved four times, battled insurance companies, banks and even a contractor lawsuit.On November 15, 2016 they finally settled the lawsuit, their house was almost complete and ready for them to move in. Expected move in date was only days away. However on the morning of Wednesday December 7th a pipe under the kitchen sink broke flooding the whole main floor and their basement where they had just moved all their belongings. Things that had survived the fire and had been in storage were ruined. Needless to say they will not be moving in anytime soon, extensive damage to the main floor has to be gutted and redone.That brings us to today A day when they were supposed to be waking up in their house for the first time in almost two years is now a day of sorrow as this nightmare continues. Once again they find themselves taking pictures of damaged belonging, dealing with insurance companies and contractors all over again verse enjoying and preparing for this holiday season.We want nothing more for them to enjoy this holiday season, which also includes Dave and Angelas Birthdays. So we have stared a GoFundMe in hopes we can all bring some holiday cheer back into this dark time. With this money we will get them a tree, some presents and put them up in a hotel or house, something they can call their own for at least a week or more depending on what is available and affordable.In this time of giving please consider offering even a small donation! We would be more then grateful! Its the least we can do for them.We want nothing more then to be back in our home and have normalcy back into our lives. ~Angela EmeryThe Emerys do not know we have set this up. It would be Holiday Surprise!Thank you for your support!Sincerely,The Seddons, Murphys and MichaudsOn a sunnySunday afternoon, in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, my sister Olgui\\'s home was engulfed in flames. She is a humble beautiful lady, mother of two boys and a grandmother. She recently lost her lifetime husband two years ago, who lost his battle with cancer. He left behind thier home that she cherished so much because theyraised theirboys in this house and there are so many memories. She lives on the first floor of her home and her elderly in-laws live above her. Thankfully, they all walked away without injury however they have completely lost their home and belongings. Please prayfully consider a donation to help my sister and family with replacing necessities like clothing, furniture, appliances etc.My closest friend experienced a horrible tragedy today. Sarah Donnelly\\'s house burned to the ground today with her 8 pets in it- 4 cats, 2 dogs, a foster puppy only 4 weeks old and a chinchilla. Sarah was not in the house at the time but did have to helplesslywatch firefighters battle the blaze that tore her house down, and know that she could not help her pets inside. I cannot imagine this ever happening, it is truly a pet owner\\'s worst nightmare. On top of losing her 8 pets, Sarah also lost everythingshe owned today. Nothing in the house can be salvaged, and it will most likely be bulldozed. If you know Sarah, you know she has dedicated her life to helping, caring for, and saving animals. She is the director of local shelter Peaceble Kingdom and has raised thousands of dollars to help animals in need. She has donated countless hours of her life to help care for animals. Please find it in your heart to help me help her get back on her feet, any amount would help. Thank you all, and love you all.Last year, Dylan Elise took a chance on life and moved nine thousand miles from New Zealand to the United States in order to persuehis life long dream of becoming a professional drummer.\\n\\nTragically on August 27th while on tour in California with legendary Blood Sweat and Tears,Dylan recieved a phone call informing him that hishome away from home in Boston, MA had burned to the groundalong with all of his possessions; his $30k custom-built DW and Paiste drum kit included.Please help Dylan get back up on his feet..On May 3rd my father was riding his motorcycle to work when he was hit by someone who was driving recklessly and turned directly into him.

Thank youLast night at approximately 10:30 pm a fire started in my sisters appartment complex. It rapidly spread in the building. My sister grabbed 2 of her 3 children and was able to get them out safely. The third, Keegan, who just turned 4 last month died in the fire.

The thieves made quick work of all our laptops, luggage, and a few musical instruments. This fundraising effort is aimed to help us replace our clothes, toiletries, five computers, a pair of violins, a trumpet, and a host of other personal and work items that are not covered by our insurance so we may get back on our feet and continue doing what we love.As most of you know, my friend Shane Dutil\\'s house burned down last night. This morning he put up a post saying that the house is a total loss. Ifyou know Shane - then you know he\\'s the type of person that will always reach out to help you when you need someone. On that note, this is me trying to help him in every way possible to get back on his feet. His family already experienced a tragic fire a few years ago with the store \"D&D Meats\". I\\'m asking you to please open your hearts in aiding Shanewith any amount of donation you can provide at this time. Anything you can give will help..

My house caught fire and is a total loss and Tim Tim didn\\'t make it. RIP my little buddy. I tried so hard to find him before I couldn\\'t take the smoke anymore. Porter is safe and sound. At this point i\\'m just shook up and not sure what to do. Tomorrow is another day I guess and I will go from there. There is no doubt that I will need help cleaning up and going through stuff and etc. I want to thank all the fire department that showed up. I really don\\'t know who they are because I am so dazed. But thank you for risking your life trying to save my place.\" - Shane.Friends, Family, and Community: Please Help us in Raising Money to BRING SHERRI HOME SAFE.

We are overwhelmed with gratitude for the love & support that we have received over the last fewdays.\\n\\n\\nWe also just wanted to share a little more about who we are & what happened on August 27th. The day that everything changed.\\n\\n\\nMy dear husband, Adam, is a full-time firefighter/paramedic for the Houston Fire Department as well as the Channelview Fire Department. Yes, you heard right. My hardworking husband works96 hours a week so that our children can be raised by & loved on by me, their momma, all day.\\n\\n\\nFor the past year & a half we have renovated our home out of our own pockets & much of it with our own two hands. We had big dreams & plans of paying off all of our debt with the equityin our home which would allow my husband to quit one job & get to spend more time with his 3 girls.\\n\\n\\nWe were weeks away from putting our house on the market when Hurricane Harvey hit just 4 days ago.\\n\\n\\nAround 11:45pm while the storm raged outside I anxiously watched the water collect in our street, pour over our sidewalk & into our driveway. I had never even seen water pool in our street much less flood. This struck some fear in me.\\n\\n\\nI stayed up to watch the news & monitor the water levels until it stopped raining around 1:30 a.m. That\\'s when I decided it would be a good time to try to rest. I laid in bed feeling heavy with fear for 30 minutes. All the while there was only light rain.Thinking, \"SURELY the water has gone down, I will go take one last look & it will give me the peace of mind I need to sleep for a few hours.\"\\n\\n\\nWrong! I walked out to find that the water had risen so high it was inches from being in our garage. I knew we were going to flood at that point & ran to wake Adam.\\n\\n\\nWe immediately began putting everything we could on top of countertops, furniture & folding tables.\\n\\n\\nLiving in a one-story house meant the attic was our only refuge (aside from sitting on the roof).\\n\\n\\nWe knew that we would need a way out if it rose too high, so we grabbed an axe, crowbar, hammer & hacksaw & put them in the attic first. Followed by plywood so we wouldn\\'t have to balance on the beams, flashlights, water, diapers & wipes, important documents,medications, a pack \\'n play to contain the kids, some folding chairs, bug spray, sunscreen, extra clothes & food.\\n\\n\\nOur youngest has a rare life-threatening food allergy condition called FPIES (Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome), so as water was pouring into our house around 2:30 a.m. we were boiling potatoes & eggs to make sure we had enough safe foods inthe attic for Hazel should we be there for a long time.\\n\\n\\nOnce we had everything we could think of (around 3:30 a.m.) we grabbed the girls & dogs & I went up to the attic with them. Adam continued to grab everything he thought may be useful to us.\\n\\n\\nJust before joining us in the attic, Adam shut off the main breaker so we wouldn\\'t have to worry about electrical currents in the water/electrical fires.\\n\\n\\nOur neighbor, Bobbie called. She was crying. They had a few inches of water in their home & didn\\'t know what to do. I instructed them to do just was we did. Go to the attic with tools to get on the roof, food & water, shut off the electricity & then Iprayed with her & tried to assure her we would get through it.\\n\\n\\nBy 4:00 a.m. we had between 6 & 8 inches of water in the house.\\n\\n\\nPresley was scared of the attic & kept asking to get in her bed. It was heartbreaking. We just kept assuring her we were safe & prayed together as a family.\\n\\n\\nThe water slowed down some so we tried to rest.\\n\\n\\nWe actually had called 911 when the water first started rushing into the house, because we knew things weren\\'t looking so good based on the rate the water was rising. At 4:08 we called again. We were put on hold at one point & told we were already on thelist. I asked how long they thought it would take & the dispatcher said, \"I don\\'t know. We just don\\'t have the resources. Someone was just rescued out of a house with 12 feet of water in it.\"\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s when we realized it would probably be a while.\\n\\n\\nSo we prayed and we prayed and we prayed some more. We thanked God for each breath we had been given. We thanked Him for our children. We prayed for rescue & we prayed that the glory would all be His.\\n\\n\\nAround 6 a.m. we were exhausted & feeling helpless. The water was about 18 inches deep in the house. No sign of rescue. Adam sent out a desperate plea to the guys from HFD for help. We cried. And then Adam decided to do something about it.\\n\\n\\nHe got busy cutting a hole in our roof so we could get out & hopefully be spotted by rescue.\\n\\n\\nOnce he finished our\\'s he went next door & cut a hole in their roof.\\n\\n\\nFor the next few hours Adam went around looking for help & looking for anyone he could help.\\n\\n\\nI stayed in the attic with the girls. God gave me an overwhelming sense of peace that we would be rescued, but you can\\'t help but think about the alternative in that situation. I decided to sing songs of praise to God as loud as I possibly could & I wept.I wept for my girls.\\n\\n\\nNothing can prepare a parent for the agony of knowing your children are in danger & you can\\'t save them, because you\\'re in need of saving, too. I kept looking at their angelic faces & telling them how much I loved them & how precious they are.\\n\\n\\nJust before 7:00 a.m. the sun came up. We could hear boats. In fact one spotted Adam while he was out in the water.\\n\\n\\nBy 8 a.m. the water is probably 2.5 feet deep in the house & I finally had a chance to look out on the roof. I couldn\\'t believe what I saw. Our entire neighborhood was engulfed by the creek. My van was halfway submerged & Adam\\'s Civic wasn\\'t even visible.\\n\\n\\nBy 8:30 I was spending more time on the roof looking for rescue boats. We saw several, but the people closest to the creek were priority.\\n\\n\\nFinally around 9:00 a.m. a boat passed & we waved & yelled out to them that we had babies. They asked how many & the ages & immediately came to our rescue. I went into the attic to get everything we needed to take with us.\\n\\n\\nI heard someone climb through the hole & assumed it was Adam. I called out to him & looked up to see a Friendwood firefighter. My heart nearly leapt out of my chest. We were really being rescued! My babies would be okay!\\n\\n\\nI crawled the girls over to the escape hole & they got them down into the boat. Then came the dogs & then came myself, with a select few necessities.\\n\\n\\nWe went next door for my husband & the crew to rescue our neighbor. Once she was safely in the boat they ferried my husband across the street so he could help an elderly neighbor get to higher ground.\\n\\n\\nHe stayed with her while we were boated to dry land.\\n\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until we got to the Click2Houston van that I realized our neighborhood was one of the worst in Houston (at the time). Considering we weren\\'t in a flood zone & never flooded I just assumed it was widespread devastation everywhere.\\n\\n\\nShortly after I was interviewed.\\n\\n\\n https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.60.2/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/2031081/uiconf_id/36217061/entry_id/0_x4pxcwj8?wid=_2031081&iframeembed=true&playerId=media-preview_4_0_x4pxcwj8&entry_id=0_x4pxcwj8&flashvars%5BstreamerType%5D=auto\\n\\nWe spent that night with friends who took us in, clothed & fed us.\\n\\n\\nWe are now staying with my parents until our housing situation is worked out. By the time we were rescued there was 3 feet of water in our home & we believe it rose even more after we left. Just about everything is destroyed. We had no flood insurance,because by all historical accounts, there was no reason to.\\n\\n\\nWe are prayerful that God will provide & restore everything that we lost. We have a long road of recovery ahead of us, but we have been so blessed by the kindness shown to us in this most trying time & feel nothing, but gratitude for another day of life.Please continue to pray for all of those effected by Harvey.\\n\\n\\nGod bless you,\\n\\n\\nJess EllisEarlier this week our sweet Amber was injured in an accident while en route to transport a baby to the ICN. I think a lot of us had forgotten that transporting these tiny patients puts the nurses who are selfless enough to do it in harm\\'s way. SomethingI don\\'t think we will ever forget again.While Amber has lots of support in place, I think the best thing we can get started with to help keep her spirits up and stress level as low as possible will be to raise some funds so that she and Christian only need to focus on her recovery.We are so lucky to work in a place that isn\\'t just a work place. We take care of each other, we support each other, and we help each other when we are hurting. Please know that all well-wishes and offers for help are so appreciated by Amber, Christian, and her family. She is dealing with a lot, both physically and otherwise, and I think at this point, the kindest thing we can do is provide this support while also respecting her privacy. After talking to Christian, they are ok with sharing this further than the ICN, so feel free to spread the word so that we can offer them as much help as possible!Thank you all so much for helping our gorgeous girl!Just a few years after graduating from The University of Georgia I had started realizing lifelong dreams; that is when I began experiencing symptoms I thought was a pinched nerve. It was strange that two Emory neurologist couldn\\'t diagnose me and passed on to the third. You can imagine my shock being told at 26 I would be dead before 30 from ALS. The last 28 years have been filled with challenges, but this last one has thrown me for a loop. Having a caregiver poison me was totally unexpected to say the least. This has created a financial impossibility temporarily. My budget can afford a live in caregiver, which I\\'m searching for, but I am forced to hire an agency (much more expensive) until a permanent caregiver can be hired. I was referred to an excellent agency that is charging me $13.50 an hour, which is cheap for an agency. While I negoiated a good rate agency that is $324 a day to stay alive. Blows my weekly caregiver budget in two days. I\\'m not worth it beyond what I can\\'t pay for.. I humbly ask for a handout. I am sorry. I thought I had made myself financially independent to fund my existence I just didn\\'t calculate someone poisoning me. Thank you so much so very much for your consideration. I desperately desire the opportunity to complete my autobiography hoping it will encourage others. Wishing you all the best!David JayneHello, my neighbor Amanda Wrobel lost her house and most of her fur babies to a fire today. Amanda is in ICU with burns to her hands and face from trying to rescue her pets. One of her dogs was unharmed but two of her dogs had to go to the emergency vet with burns. The rest of her dogs and cats didn\\'t escape in time. Her house and everything in it is a total loss. I\\'m hoping the community can pull together and help her get back on her feet. Any donation helps no matter how big or small. Please put the state you are donating from so we know how far this has reached and where all of this love is coming from Update on Amanda.... She has burns over 40% of her body and is in a medical induced coma because of the amount of pain she is in. She has a long road ahead of her. The two dogs that went to the vet will be ok but they are keeping them for a few days to make sure the burns don\\'t get infected. I am amazed by the amount of support this community has provided in just 1 day. Thank you all SO much! Please keep sharing this page and keep sending prayers her way!Hello everyone.My family is in dire need of your love and support. I\\'m going to go ahead and state that I don\\'t know what my sisters medical expenses will be, or my nephews, but even this money could help them to just survive and live for the next couple months.I\\'m going to start by this;My sister is 26 years old, freshly graduated from nursing school with a little boy named Kaiden, who is 4 years old. She is also 5 months pregant to her boyfriend of 3 years Mike McLaughlin. I am so heart broken to say that while they were heading to North Carolina this past Tuesday, May 2nd, 2017,  for job interviews, they were hit by an 18 wheeler. Mike did not make it. Aleshia is bruised, has a broken elbow,  a broken hand, facial contusions and road rash all over her body. Kaiden has two broken arms, a terrible torn up foot that will need plastic surgery, and has a laceration  that has been stapled on his head. Mike and Aleshia\\'s unborn child is doing very well, and fighting hard like his daddy would want him to.  There may be physical damage, but there is so much more emotional trauma.I know no amount of money or donations can fill the void my sister is feeling, that Kaiden is feeling, or that mikes child will feel, if you cannot donate, even kind words would be so appreciated. Please keep the McLaughlin family in your prayers, as for they need help just as much as we do. Thank you all for just taking the time to read this. Thank you all and God bless.On December 7, 2016, my sister Mckenzie and brother-in-law Colton\\'s home burned down. We thank God that everyone including pets are safe. ALL their belongings have been lost, including all personal affects, wedding mementos and both their cars. Mckenzie and Colton literally only have the clothing on their backs. We are asking and praying that people who see this would be willing to donate so that they could begin to rebuild their lives. Clothing donations will beaccepted at my parents home in Flagstaff (please contact me for their address). Any dollar amount will help. If you are unable to donate we ask that you would please pray for this beautiful loving couple and my family in this time of need and Christmas season.Funds will be handled by our loving parents Kim and Levonne Wilkin and used to replace items not covered by insurance and given to Mckenzie and Colton for all and any needs.This is the home of Officer Michael D. Martin, Linden NC. Whole home burned to the ground while away to the beach for our father\\'s birthday. Ourfamily was planning on having a dinner to celebrate the Christmas Holiday but we were met with this sight upon return home. PLEASE SHARE YOUR SUPPORT all help is appreciated.\\nThank you and God Bless\\n~The Martins.My name is Emily Olguin. I am a mother of two amazing kids. 2016 has been one of the hardest years for me and my little family. I was let go from my job in November and had finally found myself a new job, but I have not received my first payroll yet. I have always been a very hard worker and always put my kids above all my priorities. Well, this morning I was awaken by my car alarm... My car was being towed away. It has been repossessed. Along with the car being taken away, my kids Christmas presents are in the trunk of the car. I have 10 days from today to come up with the past due amount and additional unknown towing fees or my car will be sold at auction. I have no pay stub to go and get a loan. I have no parents or family to borrow from. I am asking if there is any way I could have some assistance from anyone out there to help me get my car out of repo before December 26th. I am willing to work it off. I honestly just feel so lost and confused. Anything will help and I am truly grateful and appreciate any help!Taylor Strayhorn lost her dad when she was in middle school.

       "  'This is Khobi - he\\'s a 9 month old cockapoo who belongs to my brother and his girlfriend.  He has struggled with going up and down stairs, not being able to jump on the couch, running and just playing around with other dogs.Khobi recently fell down the stairs and as a result of an x-ray, they found out he has hip dysplasia in both of his hips, and needs surgery. In addition to repairing his hips, the surgery will also remove arthitis in his hip area, which is causing him a great deal of pain.  Without pet insurance, this surgery is about $3k a hip, and without it, Khobi\\'s pain will not only continue to increase, but he will get to a point where he will no longer be able to walk on his hind legs, nevermind run around or play like the other dogs. Khobi is the sweetest little boy and he loves to be part of the fun, but unfortuantely cannot partake like the other dogs can. If you are able to contribute any funds at all to help with Khobi\\'s surgery costs, it would be greatly appreciated! No amount is too small, and every bit helps.  It breaks our hearts to see him struggling and we cannot wait to have Khobi feeling better and jumping around like the playful little dog he was meant to be. Thank you so much!It has been an emotional roller coaster of a day. We are sure that most of you have met Max here whilevisiting Moto-Vated. -And as most of you can relate, Max isn\\'t just our \"pet\" he is a family member, and best friend to our 6 year old, Xoey. Last night Max wasn\\'t acting like his spunky self and we took notice. This morning he was still lethargic and was gagging, and slobbering profusely. We rushed Max to the Emergency Animal Hospital. The veterinarian ran tests and came back to us with the horrible news. Max\\'s stomach has flipped. This is a fatal situation for a dog of Max\\'s size. The vet told us we only had a few days left with Max if we could not afford the emergency surgery which totals $4,200. Our minds were flooded with questions and thoughts \"that is impossible\" and \"how will we tell Xoey\" \"should we let her tell him bye\" Our hearts were shattered at that very moment.After much consideration we have decided that \"anything is possible with God\" and we can not let a member of our family go. Not yet. Max means so much to us and we will do whatever it takes to save him. If you are able to help in any way at all financially , we would more than greatly appreciate it. If you are not able to help financially, your prayers are just as greatly appreciated as well as needed. We hope to update you all very soon on Max\\'s condition. Thank you all in advance for your thoughts, prayers and donations. Donnie, Amanda and XoeyMy name is sumo. On Valentine\\'s day my back started hurting me and the next day I couldn\\'t walk. I have a slipped disc and I\\'m in a lot of pain. I lost all motor skills in the rear end of my body. I can\\'t even pee. My mommy and daddy just took me to the hospital, and it costs $9,695.00 for my surgery. My parents already paid $3,500.00 but they need help paying the rest.

My pups are my whole world, and I am doing everything imaginable to find my babies and get them home!The search for B&Z has not been easy, and we could use some help covering some costs. We had a separate reward fund, but we could use help covering new costs, such as hiring expert video analysts to look at the surveillance video footage and the fees for placing ads in newspapers. All donations will go toward our efforts to get B&Z home, and any leftover money that remains when B&Z are found will be donated to pet rescue organizations. Thank you again for all your support and love in finding my fur babies--I know one day soon we\\'ll get them home! <3UPDATE: THANK YOU EVERYONE! We were able to reach our goal and exceed it as well! This helps us big time because it covers his first set of surgery and starts his rehabilitation. Although he may require a bit more later on it is defintely taking stress off knowing he is covered for the first half!

He was able to move his pelvic limbs and push off to advance forward. Crepitus was present in both carpi, both elbows, both stifles, both tarsi and both hips. We discussed the severity of Chance\\' multiple issues, poor prognosis to return to function (pelvic limbs have better prognosis than thoracic limbs), and need for extensive therapy (surgery and rehabilitation) for at least 3-6 months if not longer. Love and Second Chances Rescue has elected to repeat radiographs tomorrow and depending on the extent are considering surgery with Dr. Dearmin. I advised to continue passive range of motion, massage and tickling pelvic feet to initiate movement of the limbs, and to stop swimming until suture removal. Once the sutures are removed, Chance should return to see me for further rehabilitation therapy.UPDATE 04/11/2014: Chance after his first set of surgery.TREATMENT/SURGERY/REHABILITATION ESTIMATE:Below are the estimates of what his treamtent, surgery, and rehab cost maybe. This is based off of 1-2 surgeries (he may need another depending on recovery) and 3-6 months rehab estimate.VIDEO: Here are some videos of Chance in the early stages.\\n\\nThis was the first video sent to us when Chance was still at the shelter, he was so tiny and helpless!\\n\\nAdorable video created by Alix Vincent one of our amazing volunteers!Connie Hobby\\'s beloved dog, Suri was hit by a car last night.  Both hips were fractured and Vet School at MSU gave Connie a quote of $5-6000 to repair.  Connie is in the process of trying to secure a loan from the bank.  If you know Connie at all you know what Suri  and all her pets mean to her.  If you can contribute any amount,  those of us who love Connie and Suri will be very greatful.   Please keep Connie and sweet Suri in your prayers.CALLING ALL ANIMAL LOVERS, your help is MUCHMUCHMUCH needed..My (neighbor &) good friend\\'s cat was hit by a car today. The driver was speeding down Pennsylvania Ave, and didn\\'t even break when he hit Bella. It fractured her skull and split her jaw, which subsequently sent enough pressure to her eye socket to push out her eye. She is alive, which is a heaven\\'s blessing. The tiny girl is barley a year old. The surgery is figuratively not going to cost a fortune but it is a pretty penny, at least for a recent college graduate. The cat\\'s owner, Mike, is most likely going to choose one of the two payment plans offered to help curb the financial pressure of the surgery.On September 11 Focus and Sammee accidentally got in to a bottle of ibuprofen (large amounts are fatal to puppies). We came home from paying bills to find them on the floor with the chewed up bottle, Sammee still had the bottle hanging out of his mouth, the top completely off and the bottle empty .We had to rush them to their vet where they received $1300 worth of testings, charcoal to induce vomiting and blood tests on their kidneys and internal organs . After that the vet told us this is an emergency situation and they HAVE to be seen over night (for the whole weekend) to observe and esentially run a dialysis IV drip on them constantly .Obviously that is costly and CT doesn\\'t allow payments, you have to pay now or they won\\'t do anything about them. I hate asking for help, but this is essential to my little family\\'s well being .They are my whole worldThe above are the estimates for each dog from the ER and the description of each procedure.Zara was not her name when BARK brought her in as BARK Aussie #270. We renamed her Zara because it means princess or to blossom, and this girl is a dog who deserves to be a princess and we want more than anything to blossom.Zara is a two year old Australian Shepherd who is located in Tallahassee, Florida. BARK got her from her owner, who advertised her on Craigslist. We made arrangements for the owner to leave her at a local vet\\'s office for her foster mom to pick up. What we did not count on was that Zara would spend a week at Oakwood Animal Hospital before she could leave.You see, Zara was near death when she came in on July 9. She had not been fed regularly and weighed 17.4 pounds, when she should have weighed at least 35 pounds. Zara was anemic, had severe diarrhea and hookworms. Her body temperature was close to 90 degrees F when it should have been 100.The vet was not sure she would survive the first couple of days. Zara needed two blood transfusions as well as IV nutrients and fluids. She was too weak to leave the hospital for a week. Zara also has heartworms and will need to be treated for those once she regains her health.Zara is now in a temporary foster home, but we still don\\'t know the extent of her physical problems. The vet is ruling out health issues methodically, which means her bill is already over $1,000.Help BARK help Zara. We want so much to give her the great life she deservesso that she can forget the lifeof hell she has been living. Making a difference one Aussie at a time.Hello, my name is LuLu. I\\'m 1year and 5months old, I\\'m a Miniature Dachshund little girl. I\\'ve been sick for awhile and doctors recently found out that I have some intestine problems. I told it could be one of these three diseases, Inflammatory bowel disease, Intussusception or Cancer. I\\'m scheduled for more tests and need to have a biopsy to find out which one it is. My tummy is big and swollen and I don\\'t have much energy lately. Mommy is working so hard to cover these medical expenses but there very costly and it\\'s getting very hard for her to afford so I\\'ve decided to ask my friends for help. It doesn\\'t have to be a large amount, just few bucks, whatever you can give will help me and mommy a lot and if you can\\'t help finacially please help by saying a prayer for me and share this page and spread the word to your friends.Thank you so much.Love, LuLuLuLu The Dachshund DiaryMy name is Charlie, I\\'m doing this because I am trying to help my friend Rachel. I met Rachel in 2005. My wife and I run a cat rescue shelter and Rachel, Dr. Rachel, was a young vet just starting out. She was great. We loved her right from the beginning. It wasn\\'t long before she started her own practice and in no time she had built it into a thriving business.  A terrible thing happened on June 23rd, 2014. A fire gutted her new clinic. She lost everything. This was a terrible blow to her and a horrific blow to all of us who count on her. She had insurance, but like most of us the coveragewasn\\'t enough. She has been able to rebuild for the most part, but she is still in financial trouble. If I can\\'t help her get through this next year or so I am afraid she might lose the business. This would be devastatingfor our shelter and for everybody in the community that depends on her.  She does so much for everyone, for those who can pay and for those who can\\'t. Please help me save the Appleton Veterinary Clinic. Anything that you can do will help her keep her head above water, and with a little luck she will get through this. Thank You,Charlie DiercksPrairie Winds Feline SanctuaryWe are a community coming together to mourn the loss of a brave military service dog, who deserves the honor to be laid to rest with a military funeral and burial. This soldier was found fatally wounded by his owner and friend Matt Bessler (also a military war veteran) after Matt returned home from a hunting trip. Major Mike is a former military combat dog that had served two tours of duty in Iraq. Please help us fund a funeral that will do this military war veteran the respect he deserves.Any extra donations will be distributed to a military based program that honors and supports military war veterans.I have been contacted by gofundme for validation purposes and to make sure that the donors are not being taken advantage of due to the size of this campaign and the national attention of the story. Which is absolutey fine and helps to reassure the purpose of this account.Here are the questions asked with my answers:1. Who you are: my name is Jessica Campbell2. Where you\\'re from: I was born and raised in Frannie, WY.  I now reside in Cowley Wy and own and operate a business in Powell,WY. Now these towns are about only 15 minutes apart.3. Your relationship to the parties you\\'re raising funds for: Matt and Major Mike (more Matt then Mike but Mike was always welcome) both attended and trained at my gym on and off for the the past 1.5-2 years.4. How the funds will be spent (be specific as possible): the funding will be spent on funeral services, necropsy (animal autopsy), an other support and any other costs that Matt may have in association with the shooting incident and the funeral for Major Mike (military honors, etc.). Any and all left over funds will be donated to an organization for war veterans that Matt works with and will be of his choosing. I will update every one every time there is a change or where the funds are spent.5. How you intend to get the funds to those in need: I do not have access to the funds. That is why I chose gofundme, these funds will go directly to Matt as needed for use and then to the organizations of Matt\\'s choosing.Please follow the link below to read a recent article written in the Washington Post telling the story of two amazing soldiers who went through hell together both in Iraq and back home here in the U.S.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/07/02/a-decorated-soldier-and-his-beloved-combat-dog-both-returned-from-iraq-with-ptsd-and-found-support-in-each-other/Meet Finn.  Finn is the sweetest 4 year old Lab a girl could ask for.  Last Wednesday night Finn was up all night with a uncontrollable vomiting.  He was rushed to his vet first thing Thursday morning, given meds, and spent the rest of the day resting at home.  We had the same experience Thursday night. After 3 consecutive days in the vet testing blood & doing X-rays we were stumped.  Finn was rushed to the ER in Charleston early Sunday morning when he still hadn\\'t eaten any food or drank any water since Wednesday.  He has been in the ICU for the past 4 days.  The doctors have conducted ultrasounds and more blood tests.  Still stumped.  Finns medical bills have exceeded $9000 to date.  As many of you know, Finn is the most important thing in the world to me.  He IS my world.  I am beginning to struggle with keeping up with the vet bills, however I will not give up on sweet Finn.   Any contribution would be greatly appreciated.My girl, Littlemisshope, needs some help. She has been moving a little slow lately and after some x rays she has a problem with her hip and will need a total hip replacement. She has overcome so many challenges in her short life and will over come this one.

We have organized 2 searches but have not found him. Our next course of action is to use scent dogs but they are very expensive - any donation helps!Chase has a mental disability that would make him very disoriented within 3 days without his meds . we also know his food is very limited time is very crucial!! Thank you for anything you can do.  See the Facebook page \"Central Oregon readiness project\" for more informationKnox and I were instantly bonded from the moment we met at PAWS less than five years ago. He is a very well behaved and intelligent hound/terrier mix who loves babies, small children and small dogs. He is sensitive, extremely inquisitive and a fast learner. Everywhere we go people are always commenting on his good looks and charming personality. Some of his favorite activities include: meeting neighborhood kitties at an attempt to make friends, playing with his stuffed wiggle worm, and snuggling under the cover early in the morning.As some of you already know, this has been a difficult year for Knox and I. But we have been trucking through together. Recently it has become more difficult with his recent diagnosis of osteosarcoma (bone cancer). This is an extremely aggressive form of cancer that appears suddenly but we are lucky enough to catch it in its early stages. While there are a few options in treatment, we are choosing amputation followed by a few chemo treatments as per recommendation of Knox\\'s Oncologist Dr. Clifford at Hope Veterinary Specialists. There is a stress on acting quickly (this upcoming week) to have the best outcome and chance of living a happy and somewhat normal rest of his life (he is only 5).With your help Knox will be able to have surgery, receive  Chemotherapy, and follow up X-rays and physical therapy. The breakdown of cost is approximate and as follows: -surgery: $5,000-chemotherapy treatments: $3000-follow up physical therapy and exams: $4000Any amount of funding that exceeds the cost of Knox\\'s needs will go to PAWS and other no kill shelters in the area.I don\\'t know how to convey into words how thankful and appreciative I would be of your donation. Knox is like a child to me. I want to give him the best opportunity in a bad situation and I am unable to do so without your support. Thank you!I lost my beagle on 8-13-14. I wanted to do something in his memory. I am a huge advocate for spaying and neutering so I thought I would make a fund in his name to help adopters who adopt from shelters with the cost of spaying and neutering. I am on a mission. Will you help me with my endeavor?Top 3 Reasons to Spay and Neuter1. It helps to reduce companion animal overpopulation. Most countries have a surplus of companion animals and are forced to euthanize or disregard their great suffering. The surplus is in the millions in the United States. Cats are 45 times as prolific, and dogs 15 times as prolific, as humans. They do not need our help to expand their numbers; they need our help to reduce their numbers until there are good homes for them all.2. Sterilization of your cat or dog will increase his/her chance of a longer and healthier life. Altering your canine friend will increase his life an average of 1 to 3 years, felines, 3 to 5 years. Altered animals have a very low to no risk of mammary gland tumors/cancer, prostate cancer, perianal tumors, pyometria, and uterine, ovarian and testicular cancers.3. Sterilizing your cat/dog makes him/her a better pet, reducing his/her urge to roam and decreasing the risk of contracting diseases or getting hurt as they roam. Surveys indicate that as many as 85% of dogs hit by cars are unaltered. Intact male cats living outside have been shown to live on average less than two years. Feline Immunodeficiency Syndrome is spread by bites and intact cats fight a great deal more than altered cats. http://www.aspca.org/about-us/faq/pet-statisticsKiki is basically like my child. Today on 5/31/17 we woke up to find her home mangled and bloodied.  Whenever we got her to the vet to find out the worst news. Apparently a couple of kids got ahold of her and either put fireworks into her mouth or kicked her with a lot of force.  Her skin is separated and her jaw is broken. With surgery, meds and other expenses it comes out to almost $2000. Were trying our best for a payment plan but even that is still tough. Please share and even donate a couple of dollars if you can. I can\\'t stand to see her go....I really can\\'t. Even now writing this I\\'m lost and broken. I just hope in your heart you will help. Thank you.Yesterday (5/3/17) 68 puppies and dogs were rescued from a puppy mill in Crown Point, Indiana. The Lake County Pet Adoption shelter has taken them all in and needs monetary donations for medical treatment as well as food, blankets, cleaning supplies and towels. Please help in any way that you can.  The animals are a part of a criminal case and will not be adopted out just yet, so this will be an ongoing expense. All profits will go directly to the shelter.Our beautiful baby named phoebe is 4 years old. We were enjoying a nice day together yesterday when these two dogs attacked my baby, I got them off of her but the damage was already done. We thought we were going to lose her. We rushed her to the emergency veterinarian clinic being it was sunday and our vet was closed. They took her back. Her ear was ripped in half ,sooo many rips on her neck, back, head. The doctors had to call another doctor into the clinic bc the damage was so much. They rushed our baby into surgery with three doctors taking up 6 hr to complete. We went home an waited for the call when they were done as she had to stay the night. When we picked her up this morning it just broke my heart to see her the way she was when we were just playing the day before. We had to take her to our regular veterinarian when we picked her up as she is having to get fluids an bandage changes for the next few days. An of course all this is adding up so fast an is going to be hard to tackel alone. So im not expecting much but anything will help at this point for our baby. Thank you so much for taking the time to read about our baby an i pray she has a fast recovery. God bless.Cloud is a grey and white Siberian Husky. She is five years old. In February 2014, almost by chance, we discovered that she has cancer. The tumour is in a gland and has spread to her lymph nodes and possibly her spleen. Although we work, pet insurance has been beyond us due to circumstances beyond our controland we are also desperately trying to get our two Autistic sons into University in a climate of severe austerity where they have little or no help. We also didn\\'t expect such a young, lively little dog to develop a cancer. If you can help in any way, no matter how small, you will give a little animal the chance of a long and fulfilling life. Even if you cannot help yourself, please, please share. We are desperate and our hearts are breaking.It might be useful to add a breakdown of estimated costs. These are via our vetinarian.Surgery, Biopsy and CT Scan - 3-4,000Chemotherapy - 2,500Radiotherapy (if required) - 500 per session, approximatelyAdditional surgery would be around 4,000 if needed.In the event that we do not reach our target all funds kindly donatedwill be used for Cloudy\\'s treatment. Thank You.Manny crossed over the rainbow bridge early Christmas morning. I will be making a donation to Peace Love N Rescue Angels in his honor. My name is Karen. I am a special education teacher, working for a not-for-profit agency. My dog\\'s name is Manny, a yellow lab/pit mix and he is 83lbs of love. I adopted Manny from Bobbi and the Strays, a rescue group. When they rescued him, he was only 43lbs. On September 20 he was diagnosed with cancer in both anal glands and it has spread to his lymph nodes. There were a few different treatment options. I have decided against surgery, IV chemo, and daily radiation as it is just too invasive and the side effects are extreme. For the amount of time it could potentially give us, it is just too much to ask of my sweet boy. I have decided to give him chemotherapy in pill form. The pills alone will be $550 each month, providing the medication helps. There will also be monthly visits and tests to the oncologist. Another $500 monthly. I have already spent over $3,000 in doctor visits, tests and medications to get to this diagnosis. Radiation treatments could be $4000-$5500 if I were to pursue it. Giving Manny both chemo and radiation could give us 6-12 months. I have to hold off on radiation due to the cost. I simply cannot afford it. I honestly cannot even afford the chemotherapy, but I have to do something. This sweet boy of mine is my baby, my child. I love him with all my heart and it is killing me to have to consider the cost of treatment. Trying to figure out how to pay for all of this has led me to reach out here. I know how tight finances are for everyone and have been very hesitant to ask for help. Yet, here I am sucking up my pride and asking. ALL funds will be used to pay for Manny\\'s medical bills (medications, tests, doctor visits). I will do my best to update this page regularly to be as transparent as possible.I would be eternally grateful for any donation, no matter the amount. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I will do my very best to pay it forward when I am able. Any remaining funds will be donated to Peace-Love-N-Rescue Angels, a group which is helping pets and their families with medical and other expenses, including Manny and me.Sarah Caridi and her family awoke last night (9/11/16) to find their home engulfed in flames. Fortunately they were able to get out of it without injury, but the house was destroyed, with all of their possessions. As most of you know, Sarah and Chris have two teenage kids and a dog. They are now staying with relatives.Money cannot undo this or replace the sentimental value of what was lost. This fund will help them begin to rebuild their lives.Ivan MillerRory is a 10 month old service dog who was recently diagnosed with cancer in his nose, where the bone meets his brain, and in both sides of his nose.When I got Rory, it was love at first sight. I\\'ve had him since he was 7 weeks old, when he started training to be a service dog. He\\'s so smart, he flew through all of his classes including puppy star, CGC, and the service dog public access test.Two months ago, he started having discharge from his nose, so we took him to the vet, thinking there was an object he snuffled inside. They put him on an antibiotic and prednisone in case it was just a sinus infection. That didn\\'t work, so he was put under anesthesia for a sinus lavage. Nothing came out of the nasal flush, but Rory\\'s nasal discharge continued. We had our vet refer us to Metropolitan Vet Specialists, who gave us the bad news. They scoped him and gave him a CT scan, where they were able to see the mass and bones involved.Without chemo, Rory is expected to be with us for only a few short months (3 to 6 months were her exact words). I\\'ve sold my computer and collectibles already, but am still swimming in vet bills. I\\'ve already maxed my credit cards trying to diagnose and treat my poor boy, and my friends are asking if there\\'s a fundraiser for him, so here I am, asking if anyone would consider donating, and sharing his link around.Today One of my biggest fears happened. My best friend got out while I was in the shower and got hit by a car. I was 5 minutes to late. When I heard she got out I sprinted the neighborhood calling for her, Turned the corner and I see My poor girl, bloody, and on the concrete in shock. My first reaction was \"shes dead, this cant freaking be real\", instantly started moarning for my pup. Then thats when she looked up at me and thats when I knew, I needed to get to the animal hospital ASAP. We put her on a blanket and rushed her to the hospital. She was breathing very faintly, I could see the shock in her eyes. Blood was gushing from her head, nose, a contusion on her lip, a broken tooth, and her inner thigh. I showered her with love as she looked at me with her crystal blue eyes, Comfortying her as I knew that shes going to be in a lot of pain when the shock wore off.We brought Nala into the animal hospital on a stretcher, tears running down we hurried her to the back. From there we waited for the Vet to assess her condition.After the waiting game, we finally got the details on her state of well being.Nala is suffering from some internal bleeding, as of right now this isnt life threatening and is being monitoredover night. This being the least of the worries, she also broke her hip bad and is going to need surgery. They said if she doesnt get surgery she wont be able to walk, hike, Mush, and shes going to have complications going to the restroom and they strongly recommend putting her down.My options are very slim guys, I already Got my Care Credit maxed out for this and my only other option besides this GoFundMe is Putting her down. I cant do that. Shes 3 years old, the most sweetest girl, and full of life. If you have Met nala, Im sure you know her to have the sweetest little kisses, and she loves to snuggle. Nala has Traveled many states with Ohana and I (her mom). We just have to much to see to let her go this soon :\\'(With Nalas condition, she would be heald in the hospital until Thursday. November 3rdwill be the soonest the surgeon can get her in to work on her.Im not one to ask for help from people. I work hard to make a living. Unfortunatly given my position I do need Help from My friends, Nalas friends, and community. But in return I am Printing Tshirts with her on them to help raise money. Anyone who donates $20 or more will recieve a Nala Tshirt. All the funds that are donated Will go to paying off all of Nalas medical funds. $5000 Is the estimated cost for her bills.This means more than anything to me guys. I dont have a bunch of cool toys, nice things, I have My dogs. My pups are my life, We do everything together, and I dont want to have to cut my girls life short.Thank you everyone in advance, Much love,DallasHelp Winston live out his final days with style! #WinstonsBucketList I never knew pain like this before. Mike and I have had the worst week of our lives. Our sweet kid Winston was diagnosed with one of the worst most deadly forms of cancer and we are left feeling helpless.Winston has been diagnosed with terminal Hemangiosarcoma and has been given a few short precious weeks to live.My husband and I welcomed Winston into our Denver, CO home in May 2011. We were 28 and 30 years old. We would be getting married in October 2011. We knew would always have Goldens, because I said so ;) Mike is from Nebraska and I am from Colorado. We swapped places during college. I went to the University of Nebraska and He went to Colorado State university. We have been married 4 yrs and just celebrated our 10yr \"best friend- aversary.\"We met Winston when he was 3weeks old and fell in love instantly. He was born March 28th, 2011. We took many visits up north to Fort Collins between meeting him and getting to bring him home. We knew he was meant to be in our family.Winston is now a 5 year old sweet, handsome Golden Retriever. He is an only child and the love of our lives. He is the most loving, loyal and amazing dog in the whole world. He is basically a Unicorn. He is more than a dog, he is our baby and my companion.He is well known in our neighborhood, whether it be sitting outside the grocery store, long walks or a trip to the gym. Everyone seems to know Winston. He is recognized by his sweet demeneor, kind personality, big head and even bigger heart. We want to give Winston the ultimate bucket list. We want to make the last few weeks of his life be as great as he is. We have friends and family across the country who are devastated and want to be a part of his last few weeks. We thought ok, lets allow all of these amazing people whom we love and those we don\\'t even know help to make his last weeks here with us special.So, we can\\'t sit back and do nothing. We can\\'t cure him, but we can make the time he has left with us truly amazing. We want to raise awareness about Pet Cancer, we want to comfort others who are going through this or have been through this. We want to give our friends and family peace around all of this. My husband and I want to find peace with it all, and most importantly we want Winston to be happy.We will use any of your donation money to pay for your bucket list item if needed. Please keep in mind we will have to do something local here in CO. No flying for Winston. Anything left over from your donation we will donate to Pet Cancer Research and the Golden Retriever Rescue Fund.We will document Winston\\'s adventures here as well as a facebook page, Link to follow shortly. He can also be found onInstagram @WinstonTheRetriever .Winston is pure JOY! We can\\'t thank you enough for being part of this unfortunate path we have found ourselves on. Thank you!Mom and I playing in the snow! How this all happened:On Tuesday May 10th, 2015 we had a vet appt. that would forever change our lives for the worse. Winston was having a limp in his back right hind leg as well as being incredibly lethargic. He had been having a small cough for the past couple weeks. Nothing excessive. Sounded like he was hacking up a hairball. He usually follows me around the house and is always by my side so his lethargy was incredibly concerning. Mike and I never hesitate taking Winston to the Vet. he loves it actually. I thought it was a pulled muscle and needed some pain meds and a little rest. No big deal. I was wrong...very very wrong.Our vet performed an overall physical exam and informed us that she thought it was an urgent situation that we needed to see a Veterinary Neurologist. We headed to our local animal hospital with prayers that we wold be able to see a neurologist that evening and we were preparing ourselves for a costly MRI and potential surgery. Anything for our baby!The ER vet on duty did another exam, Winston had a brief meeting with the Neurologist on call and she noted delayed neuro responses and sensitivity on his spine. Signs that were consistent with Disc Disease. Best case scenario a little inflammation in his discs treated by steroids, worst case..invasive back surgery.Not a great prognosis but not life ending. The ER vet administered some pain meds for Winston and performed a hip x-ray to ensure there were no broken bones or any other spinal issues that could be viewed on radiographs.We were informed it was not urgent and we scheduled a full neuro exam and an MRI in the morning with the doggy neurologist. Winston was loopy all evening from the pain meds but seemed to be moving on his leg a bit better.Mike had a late night flight to WY we decided he should go since I would just be taking Winston in for his MRI in the AM and he would be home by 4pm the next day. Just in time to pick up our sweet Wincy-Bear from coming off the anesthesia.Wednesday - May 11th 2016:Winston was putting weight on his back leg and seemed more like his normal self. Happy go lucky! The Neurologist performed a complete exam and we were about to proceed with the MRI and possibly surgery depending on what the MRI showed.The Neurologist decided to run a quick set of chest xrays to make sure that there wasn\\'t an infection. I thought his small cough for the past two weeks had been a sign of allergies and drinking water too fast. I even just stocked up on Claritin since he gets allergies really bad this time of year.Then it happened....... the neurologist brought the films back into the exam room and there I was alone..by myself listening to the doctor tell me that Winston had metastasized cancer in his lungs.There I was feeling like my heart had been ripped out of my chest and my child was hurting. I needed someone with me and my best friend Michelle was there in a matter of no time. I have never prayed for a person or a dog to have lymphoma. How did I end up praying for this? But I was praying for Lymphoma. Lymphoma was a best case scenario. Winston would need to be put on some meds to get him to lay still for is Abdominal Ultrasound. The goal of the ultra sound was to identify the source of the cancer so they could biopsy it and we could treat Winston with chemo.Many dogs who are diagnosed with Lymphoma can live a normal healthy life with chemo and surgery for several months and years. This wasn\\'t the case for Winston. They can\\'t find the tumor, blood work is normal, lymph nodes are normal. It\\'s all NORMAL!So we move down the crappy list again to Hemangiosarcoma. Worst case scenario possible.... We made an apt with the oncologist for Friday May 13th. Friday the 13th.... great! May 13th 2016We met with the oncologist she confirmed what we already knew. Some form of Malignant Heamgiosarcoma. Our prognosis was 1-3months. Months???? We wouldn\\'t have a 14yr old Golden. We won\\'t even have a 6yr old golden.We can\\'t find it but we know it is there and he doesn\\'t have long. So what? What now?Chemo round one. It was suggested that we start chemo immediately as his lung x-ray showed it was a fairly fast moving and very aggressive cancer. No time to spare. It is unsettling to treat a cancer we can\\'t even find. Putting drugs into your dog, praying it works.We proceeded with chemo and felt like the oncologist left us with several questions. What about alternative therapies? What about tea? I don\\'t know. What else can we do? I have to be able to do something.Winston seemed to handle the chemo very well. We played fetch all evening and he was even eating normally. We saw signs of lethargy and he couldn\\'t run as long as normal. But he seemed happy. He is always happy. That is the thing I love the most about him. He smiles...literally smiles!May 17th 2016.It\\'s my 33rd birthday today. This will go down in the history books as the worst birthday ever....hopefully, because I can\\'t imagine anything worse.Our first oncology appointment didn\\'t sit well with Mike and I. Yes, we were getting confirmation of the absolute worst outcome for our 5 yr old Golden. But it was the bed side manner? Lack of awareness? The yelling about our terminally ill dog across a waiting room while we are both holding back tears? It didn\\'t sit well.I needed another doctor. I made an appointment with another oncologist in town. Best case scenario: his lungs have cleared up. We were holding out hope this was some bizzaro fungal infection, or a weird case of bronchitis. With my medical knowledge consisting of whatever I learned on Greys Anatomy, I knew I was grasping. What can we say, sometimes blind hope is the only thing you have.I needed a doctor that would help me create a plan. A plan on what to feed him, what supplements, what could make his time left the best it could be.This doctor was kind and compassionate. Honest and realistic. Her presentation, the way she explained his condition made us feel so much better. It wasn\\'t what she was saying it was how she was saying it.We ran another x-ray. (insert blind hope). The x-ray showed that Winston\\'s lungs had not cleared up but actually appeared worse than they did 6 days before. The chemo and steroids appeared to not be working. We didn\\'t expect chemo to cure him but keep the cancer at bay or stop the spread.Based on these new x-rays Winston\\'s prognosis has deteriorated. He has been given 3-4 weeks. Possibly less. I can\\'t begin to tell you the pain and utter heartbreak we are feeling. May 18th 2016Winston came home with us 5 yrs ago today. It has been the best 5yrs and he is my best friend. His breathing was a bit labored today and his energy level seemed diminished after chasing a few balls. He could normally play for hours. Snow for days! I am a true Colorado dog. I am covered in snow balls!!! It is AWESOME!Dad and I have snuggle time too. Mom calls me her Golden Bear. We are in Vail. It\\'s one of my favorite places in the world! I am so patient with my parents. ;)You have to drag me in from the snow. I could chase snowballs ALL DAY! I own this house. I sit where I want. Mom puts glasses and hats on me sometimes. I don\\'t mind. I sometimes sleep sitting up. I am honest to a fault. I stole 99% of these tennis balls from our neighbors front yards. I genuinely smile and pose for photos. I can\\'t help but not smile.

On Friday 6/16 Susan\\'s (now ex) boyfriend scalded her in an extremely hot bath while Susan was at work. He said and did nothing, even discouraged her from taking the dog to the vet.Macy has been in veterinary ICU since then on IV fluids, antibiotics, and morphine. She has second degree burns on her face, head neck and leg. Both eyes are ulcerative and she will be seen by an eye specialist Tulsa or Kansas City. She seems to be able to see a little but vision prognosis is unknown.Tomorrow she will be released to a local veterinary hospital - length of stay to be determined. The probability of kidney failure has declined, but the risk of infection is still high.Macy\\'s expenses to this point are estimated at $3,500 so far. If you would like to help Macy and Susan, any contribution would be helpful and appreciated. Thanks, Carol#helpmacyRiver is a five-year-old Rottweiler. She has a brain tumor that is producing spinal fluid and pressure that debilitates her coordination and strength. She is not in pain. She is alert and responsive. However she has to be carried outside and held up to go to the bathroom. Sometime she eats on her own, sometimes we feed her with a syringe. Of all the animals I\\'ve ever owned,  River is the closest to being human. Up in till April  this year she had the spirit and energy  that I could only envy .  Cornell diagnosed her with this brain tumor and they think she could live many years if she had radiation therapy called the digital knife.  We have already spent about $3500 and the surgery/radiation is another $10 to $13,000 .  I have spoken to someone who has had this procedure on their Yorky,. It\\'s over a year later and the dog is completely normal . Some of you may think that\\'s a lot of money for a dog, and it is, but life is a life some of you may think that\\'s a lot of money for a dog, and it is, but life is a life!  I\\'m asking for everyone\\'s help to save rivers life and her quality-of-life. Try to think of this as if it was your loved one...She wears  the vest now because of it\\'s a handle, I can hold her up, and if she falls, it\\'s good protection .Our friend, Amy Estes, is facing the unthinkable for any of us that have ever had a beloved pet. Scroll through her social media accounts and her love for her two cats is evident. Harrison has just been diagnosed with cancer and will be having surgery in the next few days and I\\'m hoping we can help ease the emotional pain by lessening the financial burden.Chloe is an 8 1/2 year old rescued cocker spaniel with a great joy of life. She was born with the medial patella luxation that slowly became in need of a surgical fix. She is my fourth rescue and the best dog who ever owned me. The surgery and associated costs are about $4,500. She is being treated at VCA Animal Specialty Group on Kearny Mesa Road in San Diego California USAShe had demodectic mange when i first adopted her from the El Cajon Animal Shelter in California. She was 1 1/2 years old and the mange was so bad that she could not be spay or get vaccinated until we cleared it up. It took two years but we got her in good health and now her coat is beautiful. She is funny, smart, athletic, sensitive, loyal, intuitive and kind. She loves little kids and people, even the mailman brings her treats!I am a (starving) journalist in San Diego who loves my job and loves Chloe even more. I hate even asking for help but I must give my Chloe the opportunity for a healthy life, without pain and I\\'m unable to do this on my own. Chloe and I are grateful for any help you can provide.Late last night, one of our rescue kitties named Buttercup was struck by a hit-and-run driver in front of our home. She is now receiving trauma care for shock and a shattered pelvis. We are currently caring for nine rescue cats and the cost for emergency care is overwhelming our budget. If you can help in any way, even in the smallest amount, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.My name is Mallory Poirier, I\\'m starting this fundraiser on behalf of the Benson Family and their amazing dog Hank. The Benson\\'s are wonderful people, they rescued Hank in 2015 at the age of 10! He was adoptedfrom a shelter in Pittsburgh where he was living after being found as a stray. Hank was found emaciated, had fur loss over his entire body due to skin infections. After being examinded by their Veterinarian, it was also determined that Hank had severe hip dysplasia. At the time they were able to keep Hank comfortable using anti-inflammatory and pain medications. A little over a year after his adoption, Hank had a mass removed around his throat areawhere the vet found a 22 caliber bullet lodged in his neck. This poor guy has really been through a lot! He now lives a peaceful life with two other dog brothers, Bear and Tripper. Anyone that meets Hank would not be able to deny how happy he is to have a new life with the Bensons.Hank now faces new challenges though...He is no longer responding to his medication and his hip dysplasia causes him severepain. Their veterinarian has given them two options, hip surgery...or euthinasia. The Benson\\'s would do anything for their dogs, so they have opted to have the surgery. The first hip replacement surgery is scheduled for February 16th, 2017. The cost is tremendous and I would love to see the community come together to help this amazing family. They have already done and continue to do so much for their rescue dogs. No donation is too small, and if you can\\'t donate, sharing this on your Facebook would also be very helpful! Let\\'s give Hank some extra years with the family that so selflessly brought him into their home. Thank you in advance!Four years ago I rescued Brody from a shelter when he was 2 years old. Since then he has become my best friend and family. He is my life. Five months ago Brody was diagnosed with mast cell cancer in his lymph nodes. He has had surgery to remove multiple growths and has undergone many months of chemotherapy treatment. Sadly Brody\\'s cancer is no longer responding to the chemo treatments and new growths are forming. Brody was recently seen by oncology specialists at New York Animal Medical Center. The Doctors there recommend starting radiation treatment as soon as possible as his last chance to beat his cancer. I have exhausted all of Brody\\'s pet insurance and then some, spending $3500 thus far. Brody has way more fight left in him and is still full of life. I\\'m asking for help to get him the care he needs and to extend the life of my best friend. Every little bit helps and will be greatly appreciatedThank you from Brody and friendsLast night our baby Clive (2 years old) fell through the screen window of our 8th story apartment. He landed on a wooden fence post and has suffered serious injuries including fractured ribs and a complete tear of his belly from back to front. He is very lucky to have survied the fall. The cost of his overnight at the hospital is already several thousand dollars and he will need surgery, which will be an additional cost reaching into multiple thousands of dollars. It has been a very hard decision for us to go forward with this but we could not bare to put down such a young, helathy and loving animal. He is looking at surgery for this Thursday (6/22) if the next few days go as planned. We are reaching out to all of you for help with his surgeries and medical bills. If you have ever had the opportunity to meet him you wold know he is one of the sweetest most affectionate cats out there. Thank you all for sharing and supporting this cause. We would not be coming to you all for help if we did not really need it. The surgeon will have a more accurate estimate of costs in the next couple of hours and we will update the goal as need be. Stuart and I appreciate any contribution you are willing to make.Thank you xoxoStuart and RileyPlease help me in raising money to save Rontu\\'s life! My poor puppy got hit by a car yesterday and has sustained  serious injuries. Injuries that only an expensive surgery can fix. I am faced with somehow  making that happen or putting my poor boy down. Rontu is my pal, my cuddle bug, my protector and my constant shadow. He is the adoring guardian of my four little girls who love him tremendously. He takes his role as the  guardian of his princesses very seriously and always accepts being dressed up, dragged around or laid on with such loving good nature and grace. When I\\'m sad, he\\'s always there to comfort me. He gives the best hugs and he never minds dancing with me, no matter how bad my dancing is!I can\\'t imagine not having his shadow by my side...If anyone can help me raise the funds to put him through surgery I would be so greatful! I don\\'t want to loose my friend just yet. Help me save my puppy!I\\'ve never been the type of person to ask for help or even $2. So this is very uncomfortable for me but people have given me the courage to set this up and I just couldn\\'t bare doing absolutely nothing for Cali considering she is so healthy and she has a fighting chance to beat this cancer. Any amount would be appreciated beyond belief. We will be starting her chemo treatments in the next week. This has been very hard for us, not to mention the other drastic events that have happened along the way. \\nCali is my four legged baby and if I can help her, I must. She\\'s been there through wonderful and tough times and I think she truly helped me get by. If anyone knows this pup, you know all she wants is for everyone to be happy and let her lick your face. She\\'s not a normal dog, she\\'s a cat, a human, a deer, and she\\'s the most precious thing I have ever owned. Any donation is a great donation. We appreciate everyone\\'s support they have given us. We love you all.I thank you first of all for taking the time to click on this link and hopefully help me save my dog Mila\\'s life. Previous to June 27th of this year 2015, my baby girl who\\'s only 4 years old was happy, playful, energetic, super hyper, loved running and to know her is to fall in love with her as many of you have without even ever meeting her, now she\\'s a ticking time bomb.I had taken her to a private boarding on June 23rd and was to pick her up at 4pm on June 27th. She had been to this boarding many times before with up to 14 other dogs at times ranging from all breeds, pitbulls, shepards, wolf dogs, little dogs etc. without incident. She is my documented companion animal, very loving, sweet, cuddle buddy and thinks she\\'s a 60lb lap dog.I got the call from the owner of the boarding at 1:30pm just almost 2 hours before I was supposed to pick her up. He said there had been a \"situation\" and Mila was injured and it was serious I needed to get over there asap. At this moment I didn\\'t have a vehicle but I was there within 30 minutes. When I got there I first saw the dog who attacked Mila and that dog had one injury to its forhead. I was brought around to the side of the house to where Mila was to find her stapled up and full of wounds, scared and shaking. The owner who is not a vet had taken it upon himself to staple her up without my permission. How he stapled her up I till this day do not know whether it was humane or not. He refused immediately to pay for any vet bills or give me any information to contact the owners of the dog who attacked Mila. I never signed any paper work of any sort including releasing him from any liability. By the time I got home I looked and documented every bite and wound she had and she had over 25, till this day I still find more I missed. She had wounds all over her body literally, arms, feet, hind legs, back, right side, left side, face, ears, behind her ears, armpits, chest, belly, between her hind legs and her neck. I don\\'t know how one dog (Mila) could have almost 30 wounds and one dog (other dog) have one. Well, I\\'ll tell you she\\'s doesn\\'t know how to fight, I know rare for a pitbull but that shows you the character of my dog and nobody must have been watching them for that long of an attack to occur.Since the attack my Mila is a completley different dog! She\\'s been not only super traumatized by the attack but also serverely ill from complications relating back to the attack. Within a week from the attack she got servere edema in her neck the size of a tennis ball (caused by a bite or punture wound to the neck) and what we thought was kennel cough, we now know was a misdiagnoses. Her edema has spread through out her entire body, between her 2 last vet visits which was last week she gained 4lbs in water wait over 3 days. Her health was rapidily deteriorating. Her last vet visit was this past Sunday July12th in which the Dr. took an x-ray of her lungs, which we found fluid between her lungs and chest cavity. The Dr. said \"Do Not Take Her Home, you will wake up to a Dead Dog\", she was slowly dying drowning in her own lil body. He sent us to West LA ASEC Emergency Hospital where that night they drained 880ml from her right lung which was already partially collasped due to the pressure of the fluid and 400ml from her left side. They kept Mila overnight in the ICU. They did alot of extensive tests and all her major organs are healthy, heart, kidneys, bladder, white/red cell count etc. So how this fluid got there is unknown but what is known is until we figure out how she\\'s filling up with this fluid, it will keep filling up and keep needing to be drained, its just a matter of time. Which today July 16th I think it already started to fill back up because she\\'s showing the same signs as she did this past Sunday. So why I need your help is to continue being able to drain the fluid out of her chest cavity so she dosen\\'t drown in her own body and do more extensive tests to try and find the source of how the fluid is getting in there. One therory is due to the massive trauma from the attack and the servere edema, her heart couldn\\'t keep up with all the fluid and got backed up pushing fluid into her chest cavity. But now that its happened its going to keep happening until the Dr.\\'s figure this out. And we all know vet hospitals aren\\'t like people hospitals, even thou they knew my dog would die, without any sort of down payment this past Sunday night they would have sent me home and my Mila would be dead.I\\'ve had my own health issues, almost losing my left leg to compartment syndrome with a mrsa infection the end of last year, which most of you followed and I thank you for the love and support you showed me. Fortunately, through 4 leg surgeries they were able to save my leg and I\\'m still recoverying from that. I thought about doing a gofundme account for myself last year but you know what I can make payments or arrangements to pay those debts (which are huge) but my dog can\\'t and vets won\\'t accept payments or arrangements; that\\'s why this is an urgent matter of life and death for Mila. That\\'s why I am starting this account. I hope that you find it in your heart to help me save my dog Mila\\'s life. I just want my old Mila back, it breaks my heart to see her so lethargic, in pain and suffering.I thank you in advance for every and any penny, nickel, dime, quarter or dollar you can donate.Thank You..Evita & Mila PadillaBefore reading why we currently need your help, please click on the link below. The link below is an article written by George\\'s ex-girlfriend, Esther,for a magazine. It will tell you about what Pinky has been through and how George andEsther rescued her. After reading the stubbydog link, please come back to this page to read about our cause. This story and cause is very real and we\\'re running out of time. If you would like, please message me on facebook with any questions... http://stubbydog.org/2012/08/pinkys-homecoming/Pinky currently has a cancerous melanomatumor in her jaw. She has had many treatments (nutritional, medicinal, holistic and homeopathic) to erradicate the tumor and stop the cancer from spreading which has been very successful. She has responded fabulously with zero signs of metastasis although unfortunately the tumor in her jaw is back. Fortunately, Pinky\\'s oncologist is very confident that with one more advanced RT treatment andCAT scan (to first digitally map the tumor), he will finally erradicate the tumor. This new procedure usually costs $10,000, but the doctor believes in its success so much and also understands Pinky\\'s Dad\\'s financial position, that he has agreed to charge half, only $5,000 (the cost of the CAT scan + RT). Cutting the cost in half helps prove Pinky\\'s oncologist\\'s confidence and optimism. We are all now very optimistic that through digitally mapping the tumor and re-focusing a new advanced RT treatment, this time, we will finally eradicate the tumor in her jaw for good. Its also important to reiterate that there is zero signs of cancer anywhere else in her body so killing the tumor in her jaw will greatly extend her life and rid her of the pain she is currently experiencing. The problem is that her Daddy has used all of their savings for her medical bills so far and cannot pay for this final treatment. She will die without it and she is such an important member of the family that we all cannot bear to lose her. So as George\\'s extended family, we are all stepping in to help any way we can. The tumor is currently starting to purge through her gums, so we have very little time to help.I am including pictures of Pinkyso you can see how wonderful and full of life she is. George takes her everywhere with him... even to his office. Everyone loves her where ever she goes. She is gentle, loving and good with kids. She absolutely ADORES her \"daddy\" and doesn\\'t want to be even an inch away from him.The money will pay for the RT treatment, Xrays, medications, office visits and the required CAT scan.We will be beyond thankful for any help we can get to save Pinky. Please understand that this is a real situation and we are good people, its just that our backs are up against the wall because of time. Pinky will not make it another month without the treatment which it would take us far longer to save for. Pinky\\'s daddy has also already maxed out all his credit cards and even Care Credit for veterinary care. A friend told me about this site, and I couldn\\'t believe how many good people are willing to help a stranger in their desperate time of need for a good cause. There is no time for our family to save the money for this treatment because Pinky will not survive that long! But you have our heartfelt promise to pay this kindness forward when we are able to save the money. We will continue to follow this site and help others as we have been helped. Your contribution/donation today will in fact help end Pinky\\'s pain and save her life. Please help our family save Pinky, our pretty girl.THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!Please share this page with your friends and family.For information about Pinky... http://stubbydog.org/2012/08/pinkys-homecoming/Pinky pics below...We love you pretty girl <3Emergency: Help purchase hay to feed rescued farm animals at Maple Farm Sanctuary for the fall and winter!Maple Farm Sanctuary (MFS) is a non-profit sanctuary in Mendon, Massachusetts, that rescues and provides a lifelong home for abused, abandoned, and unwanted farm animals. We were founded in 1998 by former dairy cow farmers who had a profound change of hearttoday, we are home to over 100 rescued animals including cows, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks, and llamas.As temperatures begin to drop, hay will be the main source of food and nutrition for many of our rescued animals. Unfortunately, New England recently experienced its worst drought in over ten years, so MFS was unable to grow our own hay.MFS must now purchase 3 trailer loads of hayat $6,000 each. In addition, we need shavings to serve as soft bedding for the animals this winter. With the help of compassionate animal lovers, we are seeking to raise $20,000 to purchase hay and shavings.As you can see in the video above, your gift will make a difference for so many animals, from tiny chicks to boisterous goats, lazy but lovable pigs, gentle cows and llamas, and many stately elder residents.100% of money raised towards our goal of $20,000 will be used to purchase hay and shavings. Any money raised above our goal will be put towards the myriad other expenses a non-profit sanctuary incurs, including general repairs and maintenance, veterinary costs, and additional food and nutrients. Please make your gift now to ensure that our animals have nutritious food in their bellies, warm bedding to lie down on, and a safe and loving home for life!We have the deepest and most sincere gratitude to everyone who donates - even the smallest bit counts. Our animals say \"Thank you,\" too!Tico, My four-legged son was viciously attacked on his 25\\' journey from his domicile to the vehicle we were going to meet my dad in by Nick Craven\\'s 80-90lb. pitbull, located at 825 Crossley, Detroit, Mi. 48209; whom according to the owner did not know was out unsupervised or restrained in any manner with two other pitbull\\'s whom don\\'t exhibit the same behavior. This one has attacked two who survived and one belonging to the neighbor Daron Colbert... Whom I found out yesterday did not. I have been denied Veterinary Care Credit ad I was placed on SSI and SSD for my own infirmary with cancer and don\\'t receive enough income to qualify. I am in dire straits as a result of this and he is the reason that I have motivation to get up and do and not give in to my own problems. I love this dog and need help saving him and myself too. Tico was seen by his wonderful Veterinarian at the Lincoln Park Pet Care Clinic on Southfield Rd. whose only concern was to do triage, stabilize and get me out of the facility and to a clinic who is equipped and capable of treating him... Not a concern about getting paid where I was referred to Affiliated Veterinary Emergency Services on Southfield whose first question was what my budget is or how valuable to me is my dog/son to receive their services... Based on the commitments for yet rendered mechanical work, I told them 500 and at 7pm without having received the cash as promised to give them they discontinued treatment and pushed us out the door with a $491.00 bill and a refusal of further service til that is paid and approximately $400.00-$500.00 more up front for him to receive the blood and fluids in an oxygenated incubator.This past Friday, June 3, 2016,while Aaron and Mallory were working on their farm, training horses and clients, they looked across to see smoke coming from their home. Running to the house, they unfortunately were not able to save Roo, their dog who chose to stay inside. While they were able to move their camper, which had some clothes in it, Mallory\\'s car was parked next to the house and burned as well. While they are incredibly thankful that they are ok, the devastation of Roo and countless ribbons, trophies, photos, etc from Aaron\\'s riding career as well as items from Aaron\\'s late mother cannot be replaced.The rebuilding and replacing of their home will be such a long process and there are immediate needs that we want to help meet. Aaron has given his life to being the best horseman he can and both he and Mallory have the biggest hearts and give so much to others. It\\'s our turn to give back to them in their time of need. Thank you in advance for giving.Sharon van der WaldeAround noon today, Saturday 5/27, I came across this brown and white pit who I have been calling buddy. Buddy took a nasty blow to the face via train down on campbell street here in Sandusky and was abandoned by his owners. X-rays show that his organs and bones are intact, he has a small fracture in his jaw and a large laceration above his eye.He was rushed to the Animal Emergency hospital in Lorain and has been receiving treatment since. Fluid IV, pain medication and sedation, x-rays and blood work have been administered and when the swelling goes down he is to have surgery to get his eye closed back up. The staff here has been nothing short of amazing, treating this little guy to the best of their abilities and showing him a whole lot of love.Buddies owners had been relatively indifferent throughout this process and had left him to die. In a conversation with the Lorain Sheriff it was revealed that one family member had purposely released him in hopes that he would be struck by a car. The owner then stated they will not be making it to the animal hospital due to \"anxiety\" and that Buddy should just be put down instead of saving his life.There are several more details that are less than savvy and the animal hospital chose to involve the police. Control of buddy was ultimately relinquished to me giving me full right to make decisions on his behalf. Buddy was able to stand and although the extent of his head trauma is still being reviewed, the vets were highly optimistic and surprised with what his x-rays showed. This guy was not ready to give up!He was extremely malnourished and obviously neglected prior to this accident, but a full healthy recovery is expected.This situation was truly humbling in so many ways. I am asking for donations to keep Buddies treatment going and help him on the road to recovery. Any little bit will help. He has a ranged estimate for his stay between 1600-2222. This does not include any follow up appointments. Any proceeds that exceed his bill will be directly donated back to the Animal Emergency Hospital.Once Buddy has made a full recovery he will be accepting visitors and could potentially be adopted into a caring home! At no point through this ordeal did he seem agressive, but thankful and submissive. He was great with myself and the vets. Lily and I are excited to get to know him and welcome him cautiously into our place for his recovery.Please spread the word! It is important to keep in mind that although dogs are \"property\" in the state of Ohio legally, we should respect the unconditional love they provide. These creatures should not be used as a status symbol, to complete a persona, or entertainment through violence.With utmost thanks and respect,CodyFor the last week Elvis has started exhibiting strange behaviors. Walking backwards, refusing to walk at all, only turning left. Yesterday (Friday) I took him to see our vet. She did a check up and a blood panel and everything showed him to be perfectly healthy. The recommendation short term was to watch and see if issues increased or decreased being that some conditions causing these symptoms go away on their own.In less than 24 hours this has turn into a nightmare. Mike and I came home to find Elvis standing in front of the door esentially screaming. We rushed him to the ER and have been told the most likely scenario is a brain tumor. They need to do an MRI to verify but won\\'t be able to do that until Monday. We have brought Elvis home and he is currently next to me on the bed snoring. To be bluno, we\\'re poor. A few hundred dollars is something we can scrape together but not thousands. Elvis means more to us than life and we will do anything to help him. I know it\\'s a lot of money but if anyone can help us, help Elvis, please do. Elvis is a great little man. Please help.Please help us, help Brutus. This poor dog has had to face more than his fair share of pain and suffering and does not let it get him down. As a baby he was left out in some extreme temperatures and sustained frostbite on his feet. The cruel \"breeders\" decided the best option was to chop off his toes with an axe or other crude obect. Brutus was left mamed and crippled and due to the poor way in which this was done, he is in pain every day of his life. He cannot run and play like all puppieswant to do, he can barely walk. He has to be carried over any hard surfaces or up and down stairs. He was taken in by a family who loves him very much but are not equipped for the challenges that face Brutus every day. We are raising money to correct the wrong that has been done to this amazing dog. He has had a consultation and is a prime candidate for prothetics. Please check out Orthopets in Denver, CO to see the amazing things they are doing. Please join us and together we will give this dog the life he deserves. One that is not full of pain and suffering. Together we will see this gentle giant run for the first time in his life. He will play, he will no longer be trapped in a body that was purposely and cruelly disfigured. Brutus is pure heart! Please follow his journey on Facebook at Better Paws for Brutus. We will share all his updates, and you will be part of this amazing story as it unfolds. Please support our cause and please encourage everyone you know to do the same. God bless.This weekend the animals at the Deland Middle School farm were brutally attacked by some stray dogs.  This has happened a few times but not to this extent.  A day old goat and her mother were killed and other students animals were severely injured.  These animals are raised as school projects and are a loved and cared for by the students, parents, and advisor.  Some of these animals are \"Blue Ribbon\" show animals that are expensive to care for and replace.  The cost of medical care for these injured animals are more than this organization can realistically afford.  Please help these kids get their animals healthy, and  get the animals that lost their lives replaced.  These kids work very hard and are devastated.Updated 12/19: As a result of being featured on Channel 13 last night, an anonymous donor directly donated $1,000 to VCA. We are completely overjoyed and humbled. There are no words to describe how amazing this is. As a result, I am returning our goal to $5,000. Channel 13 Feature on Sgt. Mabel! PLEASE CONTINUE TO SHARE!! Updated 12/18: The final bills are in and just under $6k. I have raised the goal to exactly $6k to account for the 5% gofundme charges and the 2.9% fee the money handling processor charges. I have all receipts for your review.Last night I arrived at VCA to a police car, two vet staff, and a distraught disabled army veteran helping load her belived service dog Sergeant Mabel out of the car and onto a pet gurney for emergency care. Sadly, Sgt. Mabel got out of her new yard and was struck by a car and seriously injured. God spoke to me clearly and said, \"Her. Help her.\" Once inside, Mabel was rushed off for evaluation and it became clear very quickly that her soldier mom wasn\\'t at all prepared to handle the burden of what was to happen financially to get her best friend and service animal back on her feet. I tell this not to elevate myself, but because I\\'ve learned to follow the voice when I\\'m told to go and do. Trusting fully that it would all get worked out I handed my credit card to the front desk staff and said do what you need to do. After a long night where I learned much about both Sgt. Mabel and her mom, the initial diagnosis and cost estimates came back. The news is positive-or at least repairable-but the costs are going to be incredible. Mabel needs two surgeries to surgically put her elbow and hips back into place as they are badly dislocated. The cost of last nights stay in ICU is estimated to be around $2,000 (I paid the $900 deposit) and the surgery estimate is between $5,000 and $7,000. I\\'m happy to provide them to anyone who would like to check them out. These costs are simply not something Sgt. Mabel\\'s mom can bear and I am committed to keeping my promise to help get Mabel back on her feet and back on duty-whatever it takes. I pray that you find it in your heart to join me in this profound leap of faith and donate to Mabel\\'s care. Mabel is needed and loved and provides comfort and protection for her mom both emotionally and physically and I will cover it all of that\\'s how it ends up. I just know in my heart that there are others who will help, so any amount is deeply apppteciated. God bless you and thank you. Mabel\\'s mom is mortified by the need to ask for financial help, but humbled and grateful. Thank you in advance and God bless you.Thursday night we got the call that no \"parent\" ever wants to get. Our child is in the hospital and is under going life threatning surgery. At midnight on Friday morning Rupa was put under to address severe bite trauma on her stomach, chest, back, and hind leg. This surgery lasted nearly 4 hours with positive thoughts coming from the doctors, her \"parents\", friends, and family. Since the surgery Rupa was transported from the Green Bay animal hospital to Appleton for observation. Her blood glucose and white blood cell counts were and are the major issue to this point. Last night she was given a dose of plasma to hopefully see an upswing in those numbers. We found out this morning it\\'s working! Rupa\\'s doctors declared that she will have to go in for surgery for a second time this afternoon, Saturday. She has fluids building up where the laserations were closed up. Rupa may also need a CT scan to check for nerve and spinal damage. She will be on many different antibiotics for several weeks as well as pain meds to help ease her while recovering. As dog parents this is something we never thought we would have to go through and are at a complete loss. While this fight goes on back in the states, Amber and I are in Mexico waiting for an emergency flight back home to help deal with all of this. So far we believe the cost to be closing in on eight thousand dollars. This bill must be paid up front, no questions asked. We have maxed out credit cards and have reached out to family. Absolutely anything will help. I believe in going back to our roots where leaning on people when in need is an okay gesture. We are leaning for Rupa.Now this isn\\'t our blood born child but Rupa is our happiest mammal in the morning, travel the country with us, would do anything to make us smile \"child\". Anyone that knows rupa understands the unconditional love she shares. We are asking you to help us fight for a pup that is not even four years old and has been tested time and time again yet still loves no matter what. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you all for at least taking a look at this post. Positive vibes from all of us!Ryan, Amber & RupaSave a Throw-Away DogNone of my dogs will go hungry tonight, but everyday is an increasing struggle. All of these loving animals have a sad story to tell, but Im here to focus on creating a happy future once they arrive on my doorstep-surrendered by owners who choose not to care for them anymore. I have been saving throw-away dogs, neglected, abused, ignored and untrained, and making them happy, healthy and ready to be on their way to a better life as an alternative to euthanization. Unfortunately, I have reached full capacity at my facility for quite a while, and since there are far more canine guests than homes to place them, I am struggling to maintain the level of care, they deserve. I must keep a dog for as long as it takes to find the right adopter, so I now turn to you for help in supporting our cause. Im Frank M. Allison from Rocks Positive K-9 Training. I have trained dogs for over 30 years with a specialty in behavior problems that include anti-social dogs. Many of these relinquished dogs can be rehabilitated and placed into loving homes, but unfortunately, some can never be adopted out and I will support them in my facility for their lifetime. One hundred percent of all donations will go to the dogs to provide food, veterinary care, and a clean, safe environment. All of these dogs are kept at my facility full time recovering from whatever theyve been through, while repairing their mind frame through training and socialization. For the first time in my 30+ years of training, Im turning to the caring public to join my fight to provide these poor animals that didnt deserve their fate, a new lease on life. Every dollar for the dogs will be greatly appreciated and please be aware you have my heartfelt gratitude. For those of you who can see your way to a $75 or more donation, we would be honored to send you a copy of my training book Allisons American Way of Dog Training as an additional thank you if you would supply us with your mailing address.Hello and thanks for visiting this link. This morning (3/9/17) our dog Gunner was hit by a car that drove off and left him (practically for dead). He had a collar on (with all of our information), but the people left him behind. After taking him to the vet, they\\'ve informed us that he\\'s broken both of his legs on his right side and he blew out a shoulder. After being referred to specialist, the total surgery bill comes to around $5000. My family loves our dogs as we love each other. Gunner is a member of our family. We won\\'t allow money to get in the way of providing for our boy, but the cost is quite steep. Our family would appreciate any form of help, whether  it\\'s a small donation of $1 or any amount that you can offer. Again, Gunner is our family member. He lives with us, goes to work with us, and goes on any trip that we can take him on. If you\\'ve been around him, you know that his heart is as golden as his fur coat. Any kind of assistance is more than appreciated. Again, we are trying to raise a total goal of $5000. Even  $1 helps. Thank you all so much for reading, and even if you can\\'t donate, a prayer for our sweet boy is welcomed as well. Thank you for reading. I rescued Fred in June of 2015. I picked him because he wasn\\'t what most may consider to be \"cute\".. plus his breath could scare cockroaches away. His jaw was broken, completely sideways, and his tongue hung out. Fred was previously abused, and was used as a BAIT DOG in dog fighting. Yet in the 2 minutes within meeting him, I knew I had to have him. I\\'d never met a more loving, affectionate pup until those moments. I first started by treating his heartworms (which the rescue told me he did not have, and then later admitted that they\\'d never even tested him for heartworms.) Next on my list was a dental cleaning. I knew my little best friend would feel so much better with a clean mouth! That was the beginning of a downward spiral. That day, Fred had 11 teeth removed, partial jaw removal, and also an unexpected mast cell tumor removal (which is cancerous.) I paid $500 that day. A week later, Fred\\'s stitches came out, leading me to pay $150 for another visit. A month later Fred started bleeding from the mouth, and acting strangely.. I knew something was terribly wrong. I took him to the vet.. and they said they didn\\'t see anything but charged me $70 and sent home some pain meds. Two days later, the strange behavior got worse. I called the vet again. They referred me to a specialist. I was told that it was urgent and needed to be seen the following day.. right before Christmas. That day, Fred went in for a consultation and three hours later came out with half his mouth removed and left me with a $3,000 bill. Fred\\'s dental emergency has gotten me in way over my head. He had multiple issues that needed to be addressed that were not expected. Exposed nerves, removal of all but 3 teeth, root rot, a punctured tongue, broken jaw, & teeth going into his nasal cavity were only some of the issues. The $3,000 surgery alone was hard to stomach but now there are other little road bumps popping up. Some might call me stupid for spending this much on a dog, but my intentions were to pay for it myself and I can admit that I bit off more than I could chew. All I wanted was to save this dog, Fred, my best buddy. There was no need and no talk of putting him down, because he\\'s too young and the specialist told me countless times that when this blows over he will live a much happier, healthier quality of life. I\\'m actually embarrassed that I\\'ve had to resort to this because I told myself I\\'d never resort to this.. and I don\\'t expect to raise much but I figure it\\'s worth a shot. If you choose to help me, I thank you, and Fred thanks you. On a beautiful Monday evening, July 10th, my neighbors Elyse and Zach Smith were taking a pleasant stroll near The Castaways with their rescued Afghan Hound....STELLA. They were almost home when they came upon a man running with a Pit Bull. Elyse and Zach paused to let them run by however, once the Pit Bull had passed the Smith\\'s, the Pit Bull turned around and began viciously attacking them with Stella taking the brunt of the attack. Zach made every attempt to intervene as he cuffed Stella\\'s neck while they both attempted to push away the Pit Bull. Elyse and Zach suffered multiple bites to their arms, hands and legs and suffered dislocated and broken fingers... All the while....the man who was running with the dog DID NOTHING! Once the Smith\\'s were able to separate the two dogs, the man and the Pit Bull ran off leaving them screaming for help and bleeding. A good Samaritan stopped to help, and they loaded Stella into their car and rushed her to the Emergency Vet. Stella underwent emergency surgery that evening. Stella\\'s leg is shattered in three places and has severed tendons, muscles and arteries. This will be the first of many surgeries and urgent care for her. I am reaching out to the community to ask that we help support the Smith\\'s with the unsurmountable (and unexpected) costs they will be facing, as a result of this tragedy. Any amount is so very much appreciated and will help offset the ER and operating expenses. STELLA\\'S STORY...She and some other puppies were turnedover to Afghan Hound Rescue of Southern California, Inc. 9 months ago.The rescue coordinator brought Stella to Zach and Elyse for foster care as a puppy, and they immediately fell in love with her. They had just rescued Lenny (Afghan Hound) from China, and they knew they had to keep Stella in their lives. Stella is a certified therapy dog and volunteers with foster children and teens monthly. Elyse teaches a training g class for free a few times a year to help people certify their dogs so they can volunteer in our community. She is amazing with kids...quiet, patient and so so sweet.Stella was rushed to the Central Orange County Emergency Vet on July 10th where she went into her first surgery. The next day she was transfered to Veterinary Specialist Services Orange County (VSSOC) where they stabilized her and Stella\\'s vet Dr. Sebestyen performed a several hour long surgery reconstructing her leg with titanium plates, screws and bone putty fusion.

My heart continues to beat but I don\\'t feel alive. My children wake up on Christmas Day. But their father was killed the night before and I don\\'t know what to say. How do I explain to my children that their father will no longer be coming home. Last minute gifts was what he wanted for his kids on Christmas Eve. Josh has more gifts than jade. \"I have to get one more gift for jade\" is what he said. Tyrone always went to the Extreme for all 4 of his kids on Christmas. Last minute gifts. \"This will be the greatest Christmas ever\" is what he said. He would spend hours putting up the tree. Making sure the decorations were in place and the lights shined brighter than the neighbors. \"People will drive by our house and stop their cars to look at our tree\" is what he said. Last minute gifts. He would set up the train set around the base of the tree and eat most of the candy canes before they were hung. Smh. I think at times he was more excited than the kids. Who would have ever thought these last minute gifts would cost him his life. What type of person would take a life in front of a child. My children are fatherless because of a thoughtless act of rage. Something that could have been totally avoided just by walking away. Tyrone was an awesome father, a thoughtful son, a caring brother and a loving husband. Tyrone Griffin Jr was stabbed to death on Christmas Eve at the Hayward target buying last minute gifts for his children whom love him dearly. God has taken one of the greatest gifts I\\'ve ever received. Even though you blessed us with your short time on this earth, I truly thank God for you Tyrone cause you were more than our \"last minute gift\"On August 29th 2015 Jamie was coming home from Costco with his daughter, Eilee, when a tree fell on the car. Both were taken to the hospital. Thankfully Eilee only had a few bumps and bruises, but Jamie was taken from his family too soon. Jamie was a wonderful guy with a goofy sense of humor that delighted his daughters, and a love for his wife that was steady and strong. His passing was abrupt and unexpected, leaving behind 2 young daughters and his wife, Jen. Jamie was the sole breadwinner of the family. Please consider donating to help his family financially through this unimaginably difficult time. Money will go towards funeral expenses, food, and basic necessities. We can\\'t help their grief or pain, but we can help lightened the financial burden, leaving Jamie\\'s loved ones with one less thing to worry about.My dad, Gilbert Arias, passed away very suddenly earlier this week at the age of 46.

In the morning, Marjorie Catone went to wake the baby who lit up every second of her life- the little light filled spirit who made everything worthwhile.  And in that moment, everything shattered. Nicholas simply did not wake up.  In the face of a terrible, tragic loss, there is nothing you can say to ease the despair of a parent who has lost a child.  \" I am so sorry \" never feels like enough. For Nick and Marjorie, and their beloved daughter Madeline, the world has fallen in.  Although funeral arrangements are made, many people have asked what they can possibly do to help. As their friend, I have started this Memorial Fund to offset the cost of arrangements that no parent should have to make, and in lieu of flowers, ask you to donate to.A scholarship for the care and education of Nicholas\\'s sister Madeline will be founded with any remaining funds.For those of you who know our son Jeffery each of you know how sweet and precious he really was.

She fled to America at the age of 18 to escape Islamic extremism and the persecution of Christians that followed the Iranian Revolution.Benneta initially settled in New York City, eventually moving to California and marrying her husband, Arlen Verdehyou, a police officer. They moved to Rialto, California and had three children, now ages 10, 12, and 15. Benneta graduated from Cal Poly, Pomona with a degree in Chemestry. She accepted a position as an inspector for the San Bernardino County Health Department where she has served for many years. Benneta was proud to work for the people of San Bernardino County. She loved her job, her community, and her country. Her greatest love, however, was for her husband, her children, and her large extended family. Benneta left the house Wednesday morning, excited to attend her Department\\'s annual meeting. It is the ultimate irony that her life would be stolen from her that day by what appears to be the same type of extremism that she fled so many years ago. This is fund will be used to benefit Benneta\\'s children, as they and the family adapt to life without her.Lori\\'s 18 year old son Devin Alexander was tragically killed in a 2 car accident outside of Pillager on Tuesday January 10th.

Errin and Chris were two individuals who found the joy and beauty in every moment they lived. They found happiness in everything they did - from watching their children grow to walks in their neighborhood. They were two of the most gracious people I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. They were kind and generous, opening their home to their friends and treating them as family, without question. If you ever needed anything, Errin and Chris were the people you called. They would give what they could and help in any way they knew how. Errin would give the shirt off her back. Chris would drop what he was doing to help the ones he loved. The two of them together were beautiful; their relationship full of laughter and light. Together, they brought Theodore and Ariella into this world. The four of them together was a sight to be seen - a family so full of love and light. Errin and Chris were amazing parents, doing everything for their children.Chris was an Infantry Staff Sergeant who served with honor and dignity at his base at Joint Base Lewis McChord. Prior to being stationed at JBLM he was a member of the Old Guard in Washington D.C.Errin was a dedicated wife, mother and friend who\\'s presence will be missed every single day. She was known to be able to make anyone smile and she loved her family and friends tremendously.Ariella was the most spirited child. She was funny and smart, vibrant and headstrong. She was a light all on her own, one that shone so brightly when you entered a room. She was nurturing in her ways, with a lot of sass and strong will to go with it. She was unlike any other child I\\'ve ever known. She was a beautiful little girl, who just shined brightly with the love from her family.The youngest of all her friends, she was always able to keep up with the big kids.Losing them suddenly has knocked the breath out of everyone that loved them. Chris, a dedicated solider, husband, and father. Errin, one of the most amazing wives and mother. Ariella, a child that was meant for greatness. We all mourn the loss of the three of them.Car accidentschange lives, and in this case, it took the lives of these three wonderful individuals, and left Theodore without his parents and his sister. We are all in disbelief, but stand united with Theodore and the rest of the family.Unfortunately, the funeral costs for Errin and Ariella are not covered by the military as they were not enrolled in family life insurance. This go fund me was created to ease the burden on Leesa, Chris\\'s mother, who is responsible for the services. Any donation big or small will help.This fund is going directly to the family to help them with any unexpected expenses and anything else they may need at this time.We ask you keep the family in your thoughts and prayers. And thank you in advance for any generosity towards this loving family.Thank you.Ps.It\\'s not an easy talk to have with your Soldier but please, look into the Family Group Life Insurance which is available at an affordable rate to Soldiers for their families.Please help. We are reaching out for our friends and neighbor, who lost their two young boys Daniel and Jacob (Paul) on Mother\\'s Day in Pinewood Springs, CO. This tragic accidental drowning has been widely aired and many are asking what they can do to help. This family is devastated and as their neighbors and friends we can help with funeral expenses that are of course unexpected. We love them and want to help in any way we can. These boys were my son\\'s best friends. Our hearts are all broken and it was his idea to try to help in this way for the family. We appreciate any help you can offer so we can ease any burden from the family. All money is going directly to the family.On October 3, 2015,Officer Peter Cormier of the North Hampton Police Department died unexpectedly at his home.

Her son Matthew was at her side and held her hand as she passed.The cancer not only took Donnas life, but left her with nothing. Sadly, she did not have life insurance. Her parents are deceased and Matthew is her only child. As next of kin, her son is responsible for her funeral. Unfortunately, he is not in a financial position to put his Mom to her final resting place. We are asking you for any help you can give for Donnas cremation, memorial and interment expenses. A memorial service is being planned for February. Updates on her services will be posted on Facebook and this page. Any donation is extremely helpful and greatly appreciated. Donna was and always will be a charismatic and positive soul, that lit up every room that she entered. She always had a smile on her face and is best known for her upbeat attitude and non-stop jokes. Especially throughout the past few months when she was ill. We are at a loss for words, and the world lost a great soul but God has definitely gained an angel. Donna will be greatly missed by all who have known her on this road of life that we are traveling. Things will never be the same without her wit, sense of style, sense of humor, and ways of caring. We appreciate your thoughtfulness, support and prayers during this difficult time.Michelle Lampert Murphy (Round Rock High School Alumni) and husband Pat Murphy (Anderson High ATX), lost two of their three children on September 5th, 2014.

Friday afternoon, the day after Thanksgiving 2016, our son, Conor, had a few friends over to go to the trampoline park, eat pizza, and spend the night. While they were waiting to go to the trampoline park, they went to the next cul-de-sac to wheel around. Conor was on his longboard, and came down the hill. When he turned the corner, he hit some wet leaves and skidded. When the leaves ended, so did the skid, launching Conor off his board. He hit the back of his head on the road and was knocked unconscious. His friends called us and 911 at the same time. Conor was taken to the local hospital and then to Connecticut Children\\'s Medical Center in Hartford. At the hospital, they performed a CT scan which showed a skull fracture and two brain bruises. He didn\\'t break anything else, just the most important part! The trauma staff and neurosurgical staff were confident that Conor\\'s injury was recoverable given a few days. But although his CT scans showed the injury was stable, Conor\\'s cranial pressure never stabilized. After 6 days, Conor required surgery to relieve his pressure. He nearly died on the way to the operating room. The neurosurgeon was confident the procedure was successful. It didn\\'t work though, and a second surgery was required.  In this surgery, the neurosurgeon saw bruising all over Conor\\'s brain, and stated that it was more consistent with high velocity impact rather than a skateboarding accident. His injury was massive head trauma, and it was inevitably unrecoverable.At 4:26 PM 12/5/2016, Conor passed away peacefully at Connecticut Children\\'s Medical Clinic. 14 Years 7 Months 2 Days will never be long enough.We did not have life insurance for him, and we have no more family savings while Whit has been unemployed, trying to shift careers. He was only 14 years old and shouldn\\'t have been taken from us. We don\\'t want him to be forgotten because he was so full of life and had SO much potential.We know entire communities rallied for his recovery. People we didn\\'t know prayed for him. Multiple schools in the region held days in which the students dressed up for Conor, like Conor did. He dressed up for school, wearing dress shirts and bow ties 2-3 times a week. And we cannot tell you how much that support has meant.He was an outstanding cross country runner in only two years of running. As an 8th grader in his first season of cross country, he took 22nd in the state. And as a Freshman, he lettered on a strong Ledyard Connecticut cross country team this year. We want to build a fund to help a cross country runner or more to join the High School team, or to help the team directly itself. Please help us create a fitting memorial for a beautiful boy.In April 2016 a movement was started in North Dakota with the Sacred Stone encampment. After news spread of the approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline, hundreds and then thousands of Indigenous people and Indigenous allies from across the globe came together to pray peacefully and bring attention to the disgraceful work of Energy Transfer Partners and those who approved the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Today, thousands are living at the encampment and they will not leave until the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline stops. Winter is coming and it\\'s already getting too cold to camp which drives people away from the encampment.We stand with Standing Rock and the Sacred Stone Encampment and were here today to help those at the front lines stay warm so they may continue their peaceful acts of protection. ABOUT THE MOVEMENT: After the failed Keystone Pipeline, a new and virtually regulation free Dakota Access Pipeline was approved. Energy Transfer Partners was awarded the right to build a pipeline. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) will be built on top of several burial grounds and sacred sites - some of which have already been decimated by Energy Transfer Partners employees back in September. Energy Transfer Partners plans to build the pipeline under the Missouri River which is the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Reservation and several outlying communities. If this pipeline were to burst or leak  drinking water would be contaminated - potentially all the way down the Missouri River to the Mississippi and on into the Gulf of Mexico. As weve seen time and again, theres no pipeline thats completely secure. Billions of dollars (in some cases taxpayer dollars) have been spent on cleaning up messes left behind by oil companies. Leaks and spills have ravaged communities and their water supply in the wake of these spills.CALL TO ACTION: It is time to stop looking to oil and fracking companies to solve our energy problems. It is time to rethink energy use, respect the earth, and importantly, its time to support the Indigenous people who have relatives in the ground where this pipeline is to be built. It is time to respect Native holy sites which are now being destroyed by big corporations which seem to care more about money than respect for our earth and the generations to follow.We have been working with a group of people within the Sicangu Camp (a camp within Sacred Stone) who have dedicated their lives to this encampment until the day this pipeline is stopped. They plan to stay no matter how cold it gets and no matter how much money they lose from their day jobs - its that important. We reached out to our friends at the front line and asked them what would help them the most as they brave the winter. Tents and warmth were their first concern, so now weve organizing, researched the best possible wind and weatherproof systems, and figured out how to get it to Standing Rock. THE ACTION: Our goal is to raise funds to purchase ten large wind and weatherproof tents, woodstoves to be used inside the tents, firewood, and hand cranked laundry machines for the encampment. With these weatherproof tents and woodstoves, peaceful protectors will have a space to gather, sleep, eat and keep warm during the frigid cold North Dakota winter. (Check out the video to see how durable these tents really are!) Keeping clothing clean is difficult as winter approaches. Having a hand-cranked washing machine wringer will help those who are camping stay clean. This will be funded last, as warmth is the priority.THE PLAN:A tent, wood stove and piping can be purchased for $1549/unit. Every time we hit this threshold of $1549, we will send a tent and woodstove out to our friends at theencampment. The tent/stoves will be purchased from Cabelas in Rapid City. Each time we deliver two tent/stove units, well raise another $600to send a load of wood. Once we are able to supply the camp with the warmth of tents, stoves and wood, we\\'ll send the washing units. Cost breakdown: Tent/Stove Package 12 x 20 wall tent with woodstove = $1,549/unit including tax.10 tents including stoves units = $15,490(includes tax).Firewood delivery$600 per load (load = 1 ton trailer 16ft long stacked 5ft high)5 loads x $600 = 3,000Wash stationsIncludes clothes wringer, 1 gallon bucket for hot water, 5 gallon cold water container/rinse station = $282/unit including tax2 washing units = $564 (includes tax)Delivery chargesFREESubtotal: $ 19,054Go Fund Me 8% site cost: $ 1,525Grand total: $ 20,579If you feel compelled to stand with those on the front line, but cannot be there in person, please donate and know that youre supporting the movement. If you cannot donate at this time, please share this page and lets get help to those standing at Standing Rock.Once we have tents on the ground, we will send updates with photos so you know they\\'ve arrived and you can see your donation in action. Please help us spread the word. Every little bit helps. Thank you for your support!For transparency purposes, the tents are being purchased by Joyce McPherson and funds will go to her for the purchase of the tent/stove/washing units and she will pay the person delivering wood. We are then having members from theSicangu Camp pick-up the tents/stoves/washing unitsat the Rapid City Cabela\\'s (closest store possible) and deliver them to camp. We are happy to provide receipts for all transactions. If there\\'s any funding above and beyond our goal, it will go toward more tents - or what ever is the most practical for the campers on the ground. Please email us if you would like to see receipts or with any other questions.Sandra Bland affectionately referred to as Sandy by many who knew and loved her was a vibrant, outspoken and intelligent 28-year-old young woman. She entered this world with a mission and purpose; and from that day forth she made a tremendous impression on others with a trailblazing spirit of activism, advocacy, and an uncompromising passion for equality until she departed this world. A 2009 Prairie View A&M alum, Sandy had recently returned to Texas to begin a new employment opportunity with her alma mater. On Friday, July 10, 2015, Sandy was pulled over by a Texas State Trooper for failure to signal before changing lanes. The traffic stop escalated to an unlawful arrest at the Waller County Jail. On Monday, July 13, 2015, Sandy was found dead in her jail cell. The circumstances surrounding her death are at best unclear and given the information shared by Waller County officials to date, is very disturbing. Sandy was a precious daughter, cherished sister, niece, cousin, Soror and dear friend. Laid to rest peacefully on Saturday, July 25, 2015, she will be grieved for immensely by all those who had the pleasure of understanding the blossoming of a young woman discovering her voice which resonated with those who truly relished in the moments to listen to her speak her truth, a truth anchored in God and love.Sandras untimely death has garnered national attention and reignited social awareness regarding racial disparities within community policing specifically amongst African American citizens. Now that she has been laid to rest, the real battle begins as we seek to understand #whathappenedtoSandraBland while she was in police custody for 72 hours. Although the family continues to grieve, all efforts are being made to seek out the truth. If Sandys story has touched your heart, we ask that you join us as we move forward in pursuing #justiceforSandy. We thank you for your commitment to social justice and for standing in solidarity with our family.Please be aware that this fundraising message is approved by Sandra Blands family on behalf of her mother, Geneva Reed-Veal and her sisters Shante Needham, Sharon Cooper, Shavon Bland and Sierra Cole.#sayhername#sandyspeaks#sandySTILLspeaks#whathappenedtosandrabland#justiceforsandyThe loss of a child is the most devastating experience a parent can face-and missing the child never goes away.

Dayans earliest riders will remember Muddy Creek when it was just a 6 stall barn with no arena. Students traileredin for lessons that were held, weather permitting, in the middle of the pasture. The invisible ring was lighted by the headlamps of their cars. Dayan had the determination and the vision to see the bigger picture.For 54 years, Dayan has taken kids who could not financially afford to go to horse shows and taught them the value of hard work and strong character. She was a coach, a role model, and a disciplinarian to guide them in the right direction as individuals. At MCF, it has never just been about teaching kids to ride horses. It went far deeper than that. It was about how they spoke to their parents, how they treated their horse and treated each other. As a child, you dont recognize that. What you realize as you mature, though, is that you were also at MCF to learn how to be a decent human being. She gave these children responsibilities and taught them how to be good people. She gave kids who did not have the means to ride or show horses the opportunity to do it when everyone else said no. Dayan showed them that horses are not just for the wealthy, they are for people who want it so badly that they are willing to work as hard as it takes.Dayan has never looked down on anyone due to physical, financial, or other hardships. Throughout her career she has partaken in therapy whether it be for children, handicapped adults, or kids who had difficult upbringings. She was able to temporarily erase those hardships by helping them step out of that box. She had a student show on the national level who had been told she would never walk due to her physical disability. She taught a terminally ill child who adored one of Dayans trusty lesson ponies. When she became too sick to come out and see Magic, Dayan said without hesitation then well take Magic to her. Those who witnessed it will never forget the feeling of watching that little girl come outside to see the pony that she loved so dearly munching on grass in her suburban front yard.Dayans life has come with many of her own hardships. She has fought and won against breast and ovarian cancers, had twoknee replacements, two titanium shoulder replacements and a ceramic hip replacement. Through it all she has continued to fight and keep the farm alive for everyone. For many people Muddy Creek is not just a farm, its a family.Dayan has welcomed those in need, both two-legged and four-legged, for over half a century. She has made mistakes, but her heart has always been in a place of giving. Now, she needs help. Muddy Creek is under imminent threat of foreclosure due to delinquent property taxes. There is no safety net here. Should the property be foreclosed, It is unclear what will happen or where she, and the horses, will go. Should we successfully raise this money, Muddy Creek will continue to serve kids and horses for many years to come. Through the Current Agricultural Use Value (CAUV) program, beginning this year all future property taxes will be significantly reduced to a level that Dayan can support ongoing. The delinquent taxes owed total just under $27,000. By July 8th, 2016, $9,695 must be paid or foreclosure will be filed. The remaining taxes will be owed on a payment plan. We aimto raise the full $27,000 that is owed. ALL money raised will go directly to the tax bill. Should we raise more than $27,000, additional funds will be put directly towards maintenance of the barn.As you all can imagine, it is extremely difficult for Dayan to ask for help. She has always been a strong and independent woman dedicated to giving back to the riders under her charge. This is our chance to save Muddy Creek and ensure that Dayan\\'s legacy will not end here.Notice anything unusual about this photo? These children fromKitula village in Uganda have to walk miles barefoot everday to attend class, yet there is no school. Please help join me in my campaign to raise $1,500 so we can help buildthem a permanent school building and therefore abrighter future through education.Where? At the end of this month I will be travelling for two and a half weeks to Uganda to work with school children (4 - 12yrs) in and around Kampala.I will be traveling with two large suitcases full of LEGO bricks graciously donated by the LEGO Foundation in hopes of introducing learning through play.What?With the money that we raise we will be able to build a school building that will help enhance the lives of hundreds of children who deserve the right to a brighter future through education.As thereis currently no school in this impoverished rural village, we will be giving a chance to many kids that have been neglected.Why? Education is the key to poverty reduction as it increases access to economic opportunity and serves as a pathway to empowerment. Children are more likely to control their own destinies and effect change in their communities when they have access to education.Why Donate?Many times when asked to donate you don\\'t get to see the impact of your donation or can\\'t trust that the money is getting to where it should. By donating to this compaign, I will personally be taking the money to the village myself and documenting the progress of the workshopsand building of the school. https://www.footstepsinternational.org/Last December, I told you about the EPA\\'s decision to consider regulating flight pollution for the first time in history. The decision was made, laws are being crafted, and now on August 11th, 2015 the U.S. EPA will have a public hearing in downtown Washington D.C. on these proposed regulations.I registered to speak at this hearing and a Harvard lawyer from the EPA called me to inform me, repeatedly, that since I was the only registered speaker I probably shouldn\\'t even come:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxFhSk620dwNonetheless, I let them know I would attend the hearing and now there are other people registering to speak! I started thisGoFundMe to help me attend and record this historic hearing. I humbly ask you to let me represent you at this hearing, please support my efforts by donating immediately as time is very short.  https://www.gofundme.com/jimlee-epaI also intend to record this hearing and upload it to YouTube.This is what I plan to say at that hearing: In advance of the Paris COP21 conference this coming December, the Obama administration is \"acting on climate change\" by imposing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations on jet emissions. This stunning reversal comes after this administration\\'s previous efforts to kill similar legislation in the European Union. [1] The EPA is attempting to say that six greenhouse gases emitted from jet planes are a \"threat to human health\" under the Clean Air Act while doing nothing to address ongoing lawsuits over leaded aviation gasoline or the real health concerns of stakeholders (every human) worldwide: cancer-causing, heavy metal fuel additives, trade-secret chemicals, and aviation-induced cloudiness (AIC). [2]The EPA claims the authority to regulate aviation emissions under the Clean Air Act 231(a)(2)(A), a law that should protect us from the aforementioned poisonous pollution. However, the definition of \"pollution\" is being perverted to mean \"climate change gases\" in what can only be called a violation of the spirit of the law. Read it yourself: The Administrator shall, from time to time, issue proposed emission standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of aircraft engines which in his judgment causes, or contributes to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. [3]Here is the EPA\\'s sorry explanation: The Administrator is proposing to define the air pollution\\'\\' referred to in section 231(a)(2)(A) of the CAA to be the mix of six well-mixed GHGs: CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. This is the same definition that was used for the finding for purposes of section 202(a). It is the Administrator\\'s judgment that the total body of scientific evidence compellingly supports a positive endangerment finding that elevated concentrations of the six well-mixed GHGs constitute air pollution that endangers both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations within the meaning of section 231(a) of the Clean Air Act. [4] As you can see by the wording in the Clean Air Act and the EPA\\'s verbal ninjitsu, lead, barium, and trade-secret toxic chemicals clearly present a greater danger to public health than greenhouse gases, no matter how much climate science you pile up. Furthermore, Material Safety Data Sheets of aviation fuel and their additives almost always contain the same warning: \"DO NOT DUMP IN WATER.\" Yet raw fuel-dumping [5][6] or burning these dangerous chemicals and then dumping them in water is somehow safe? Finally, despite great efforts to find bio-accumulation or bio-magnification studies on precipitated aviation pollutants, none seem to exist.The EPA and Obama administration are ignoring the global outrage over the most visible climate change concern from airplanes: CLOUD CREATION.Do a search for the word \"chemtrails\" and you will see millions of concerned citizens who \"Look Up\" and wonder \"What in the World Are They Spraying?\" [7] Despite what you may think of the myriad of maladies attributed to these clouds, the global outrage is nonetheless clear. What is surprising part is that they are right to be concerned and so should you.The EPA\\'s claim that CO2 is a greater threat to human health than contrails is based on erroneous IPCC data that downplays the effects of contrails on our climate. The IPCC\\'s last assessment of contrail radiative forcing only accounted for \"linear contrails,\" meaning that any contrail that spreads out and turns into cirrus clouds was not accounted for: Because spreading contrails lose their characteristic linear shape, a component of [aviation-induced cloudiness] is indistinguishable from background cirrus. [8] The warming impact from cirrus clouds was therefore excluded from the Radiative Forcing (RF) and Radiative Forcing Index (RFI) figures of the research discussed on this site. Yet to get an accurate estimate of total warming impacts from aviation, cirrus effects should be included. Although uncertainty remains about the precise nature of aviation-induced cirrus-caused warming, we do know how cirrus clouds form, and that they have a warming impact. According to some researchers, this warming impact could be very significant. [9]How significant is the heat-trapping contrail conundrum? Contrails formed by aircraft can evolve into cirrus clouds indistinguishable from those formed naturally. These \\'spreading contrails\\' may be causing more climate warming today than all the carbon dioxide emitted by aircraft since the start of aviation. [10]Scientific understanding of how jet plane contrails turn into cirrus clouds is severly lacking but rapidly evolving. The latest research shows that cirrus clouds are filled with metal aerosols from human sources. It seems to be aluminous silicate material, which is quite common at the Earths surface. The metallic particles are also very variable. The big one that weve found is lead. ... comes from things like tetraethtyl lead in fuels ... still used in some light aviation.  So thats probably the biggest metal that we find, or the most frequent metal that we find. But we find a whole host of different metals, actually. [11][12]The following is from the IPCC\\'s own literature regarding metal particulates from aircraft exhaust: Aircraft jet engines also directly emit metal particles. Their sources include engine erosion and the combustion of fuel containing trace metal impurities or metal particles that enter the exhaust with the fuel (Chapter 7). Metal particles -- comprising elements such as Al, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ba -- are estimated to be present at the parts per billion by volume (ppbv) level at nozzle exit planes (CIAP, 1975; Fordyce and Sheibley, 1975). The corresponding concentrations of 107-108 particles/kg fuel (assuming 1-mm radius; see below) are much smaller than for soot. Although metals have been found as residuals in cirrus and contrail ice particles (Chen et al., 1998; Petzold et al., 1998; Twohy and Gandrud, 1998), their number and associated mass are considered too small to affect the formation or properties of more abundant volatile and soot plume aerosol particles. [13]Translated, this basically says that the last time someone checked (1975) aluminum, titanium, chromium, iron, nickel, and barium were \\'estimated\\' to be a small percentage of jet exhaust, and even though we find metal in contrails and cirrus, (as of 1998) we think soot is probably what is making them.The fact is, metal particles are making cirrus clouds: It would seem that you would have to change all of the aerosol in the atmosphere very radically to get a big effect on the clouds. But because mineral dust and metallic particles are such a small amount of the particulate matter  just a percent or two  it means that you only have change something about a percent or two of the particles to get a big effect on these clouds. [11][12]The latest research would seem to cast doubt on the IPCC\\'s assumptions and require serious consideration when addressing the real climate change impact of aviation.High altitude metals are likely coming from leaded AVGAS and jet exhaust. Small changes in atmospheric metal have large impacts on cirrus cloud creation. Cirrus clouds trap heat and likely have a greater climate change impact than CO2.As a result of these recent findings, I strongly encourage the EPA to consider expanding the scope of possible endangerment to include metal particulates and cirrus cloud formation from jet exhaust.If the EPA complies with the spirit of the Clean Air Act, they will protect us from metal aerosols attributed to Alzheimer\\'s, Autism, Cancer, and a plethora of other debilitating illnesses. If the EPA is truly concerned about aviation-induced climate change, they will regulate the production of contrails and cirrus clouds which change our climate our climate to a greater extent than the sum of the six greenhouse gases named above.It is the mandate and duty of the EPA to protect citizens from industries that concern themselves with profit and dollars per gallon and not with our well-being or their environmental impact.Regulating heavy metals and aviation-induced cloudiness will be meaningless without proper verification. For example, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) members sign a binding agreement to only use certain chemicals in their gas tanks, but as we all know, agreements and regulations are useless without proper verification.Therefore, I request that MANDATORY, RANDOM testing of jet exhaust be immediately implemented. This is the most important step the EPA can take to follow the spirit of the law, do its due diligence to protect us from harmful pollution, and get real-world data to improve future regulations.Most of the data behind this endangerment finding comes from research in highly controlled environments where most variables are known. We need real-world verification of non-ideal situations where fuel fouling [14] or improper maintenance end in vastly different exhaust particulates.To achieve random testing, I propose that the EPA randomly attach a trailing probe to both foreign and domestic flights, then collect and analyze the results to determine real-world exhaust constituents. Alternatively, ground-based LIDAR observations [15] may be possible over fixed, high-traffic areas. Either way you choose, we need verification and protection.In conclusion, the EPA should expand possible endangerment to include metal aerosols and cloud creation, create a verification system that includes all ICAO members, protects us from aviation pollution, holds violators accountable, and commits to better scientific accuracy for future determinations.------------- HEARING DETAILS ----------------DATE: August 11, 2015 - 10:00AMLOCATION: William Jefferson Clinton East Building, Room 1153, 101 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004.REGISTER:The last day to pre-register in advance to speak at the hearing will be August 6, 2015.

I am donating every single penny raised during the month of November to DestinyRescue.org to fund 10 (or more) rescues. Destiny Rescue doesn\\'t just raise awareness or lobby for anti sex-slavery, but they actually send trained professionals into brothels to actually rescue these children. It only costs on average about $1500 to rescue one child. If it was my son there is no amount of money I wouldn\\'t pay to rescue him.With my beard and your money, we can rescue some children.So would you join me? Every penny that is raised will be donated weather or not we hit the goal. But I pray that we surpass the goal so that we can rescue even more children.Now here are some photos of my beard journey for your enjoyment.The day I decided to grow my beard out.Beard before the beard.Truth!Awe look how cute my beard was back then.I mean my son. Look how cute my sonwas back then. Yeah, that\\'s what I meant...Don\\'t ask...Glamour shots with my beardThis is when I got my hairs did.Yes... that\\'s Kirk Cameron with me my wife and my beard making silly faces.I am cycling from Michigan to Texas SEPTEMBER 1, 2013 to raise awareness forSelf Help for Independence in Michigan Equalizing the DeafBlind (SHI-M=DB),a non-profit organization located in Jackson, Michigan. Their goal is to better the lives of Deafblind citizens through technology, Support Service Providers, workshops, trainings, and social events.SPREAD THE WORD! Can YOU help!?We are Mary Beth and Dan Reardon, but these days we are better known as Mema and Pappy. We are setting out on a great adventure to start on foot in California and walk our way across the country back home to New York.We are using our life\\'s goal of crossing the country to help kids with special needs cross their own boundaries.Our walk will raise public awareness and financial support for inclusion programs like Athletes 4 Autism (A4A), which helps kids of all abilities learn how to make friends, stand up to bullying, and improve physical fitness while learning to play recreational sports.These fun and fundamental programs are completely free to families, which means the overhead costs to \"get every kid in the game\" need to come from somewhere. That\\'s where we all can come in.The whole idea of walking across the country started many years ago. It was a thought: kinda crazy. Now, we are 60 years old-- both retired-- and the thought returned. We have always been responsible in raising our family, but now with grown kids who have families of their own, it is our time to fly and be free; to explore and learn again.Our feelings of gratitude for where we arein our lives is overwhelming, so we wondered: \"how do we combine our desire for fun and adventure with our desire to somehow give back\"? As we tossed the ideas around, and our kids and grandkids got involved, it didn\\'t take us long to know who we wanted to dedicate our adventure to. We have been inspired by Lilly and the Steiner family, and their journey in the world of Autism. We are not the ones to speak on behalf of Autism, but to be inspired in the ways we have, check out the Steiners\\' blog: http://theautismresearchfoundation.org/category/michelle-and-lilly-steiner We are making the plans and trusting that this journey will work out just the way it is suppose to.Will you help us help Athletes 4 Autism?Our starting goal is $50,000.00, which will provide free sports programs to kids with autism and their typical peers. These sport programs adapt to the special needs of each individual child, while encouraging typical kids to understand autism from first-hand experience. In the process, kids actually begin to appreciate their differences and become friends because of them not in spite of them.All donations will be mailed directly to Athletes 4 Autism\\'s parent charity: The Autism Research Foundation, a 501(c)3 tax-deductible non-profit dedicated to helping all families experiencing autism, just like Lilly\\'s.P.S.

According to UN Resolution64/292, the United Nations General Assembly explicitly \"recognized the human right to water and sanitation and acknowledged that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realisation of all human rights. The Resolution calls upon States and international organisations to provide financial resources, help capacity-building and technology transfer to help countries, in particular developing countries, to provide safe, clean, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all.In November 2002, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted General Comment No. 15 on the right to water. Article I.1 states that \"The human right to water is indispensable for leading a life in human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights. Comment No. 15 also defined the right to water as the right of everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable and physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.\"Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza are denied this right every day. The Maia Project (Maia means water in Arabic) is dedicated to bringing clean, safe drinking water to the children of Palestine. Over 90% of the water in Gaza is not potable. The health and well being of virtually every Palestinian child and adult is affected by the shortage of clean, safe water. For those who are unaware, the water crisis in Gaza has been an ongoing issue for decades.Numerous military attacks on the Gaza Strip have devastated Gazas water infrastructure, destroying wells and causing incredibly expensive damage to Gazas water and waste treatment facilities. Additionally, the Siege affects Gazas ability to maintain it\\'s sanitation and water treatment facilities, as no one has access to the necessary building materials and spare pipes and parts.As a result of all these assaults, the water in Gaza is polluted with untreated sewage, agricultural chemicals, and is brackish from seawater. Gazas water contains high levels of nitrates, chloride,fluoride, and other pollutants that cause significant health problems, including parasitic infections, kidney disease, heart disease, damage to the nervous system, cancers, weakened bones and teeth and a life-threatening type of anemia.Clean water is something that many of us take entirely for granted; if you are reading this right now, access to water is most likely not a concern dictating your everyday life. This is a matter of basic human rights, and we hope we can gain your support in making sure that everyone has access to clean water. Thank you for your support!

Thank you so very much for your support! #nodaplHello and thank you so much for visiting my fundraising site: \"Rod\\'s Challenge For Children\"! One of my favorite quotes is, \"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\". Mahatma Gandhi had this right. This webpage has information about how I plan to use my skills to help build better childhoods for kids who require medical technology to sustain life. Please take a couple of moments to educate yourself about possibly donating to my cause. Please CLICK HERE  to download the flyer and help promote this fundraiser. THE TARGET: I aim to raise $25,000 USD to support The Medically Fragile Children\\'s Foundation of Northern California (MFCFNC). Donations accepted through this website will incur an automatic 5-7% processing fee, which is taken out for administrative costs by this hosting website. Note that 100% of the collected donations will go toward supporting the MFCFNC (field trips to concerts, games, etc; efforts to facilitate family visits; and general connection with childhood experiences). Travel, guide/registration, and fundraising-incidental fees are solely being covered through personal/private funding. THE CHALLENGE:I have enrolled in an expedition on September 14, 2013, called \"The Three Peaks Challenge\" in the United Kingdom (UK). This adventure includes hiking up/down the largest peaks in Scotland, England, and Wales within a 24-hour period (including driving time). Here are the 3 peaks:1) Scotland, Ben Nevis (4409 ft) 2) England, Scafell Pike (3209 ft)3) Wales, Snowdon (3506 ft)In an effort to make this fundraiser more meaningful for potential donors and for the children we serve, I aim to complete this challenge WITH a ventilator (life support) and ventilator battery, totaling 20 lbs (9kg), in addition to the water and supplies I\\'ll already be carrying.   THE STORY:As many of you know, I am very adamant about supporting anything that enhances the well-being of children, especially when it comes to kids with disabilities/special needs. As a former boy scout, camp director, programming director, etc. I have had the privilege, as a camper and staffer/management, of knowing the importance of remaining connected with peers and the community. Camping opportunities (residential/day) hold a special place in my heart, right next to these children who have disabilities that limit their true potential and opportunity to live as happy as a life as they can. Every child, regardless of their situation, deserves the RIGHT to as many \"normal\" childhood experiences as possible.Just in case I have not shared my most wanted goal in life, here it is: To build, from the ground up, the FIRST (there may be a similar program in existence, but am unsure) hospital:camp collaboration in the United States. This would be a on a plot of land, where on one part, a camp would exist. The camp would have loads of adaptations (ramps, adequate power for medical equipment, pools, etc.) to make it as accessible as possible, both in the cabins and in the program areas. Programs would be ran by instructors who share a desire to do something wonderful for these children. On the same property, there would be a small hospital where children have access in case a medical emergency occurs. There would beds reserved for kids that are there on a long term basis and beds for respite care, who come from other hospitals in the state, but would have full access to the outdoors/programs, all within close proximity to medical support. In the summers of 2006 and 2007, I had the privilege of leading efforts to provide day-camp experiences for about 15 children, who resided in hospitals. In 2010, I spearheaded a group of about 12 hospital interdisciplinary team members, comprised of nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists, social workers, PT/OT/SLP\\'s to pave the way for 8 children to spend the night at a camp, AWAY from the hospital. We even worked with an electrician and property manager to modify the cabin\\'s electrical infrastructure to ensure that there was adequate, reliable power to support all of the medical equipment. The children had a blast engaging in programs with their counselors, peers, and nursing staff. Unfortunately, for 2 of these children, it would have been their first and only time to have spent the night outside the walls of a hospital... I have been so blessed to have met and worked with so many wonderful, amazing, inspirational, and talented people in my life. It is those people that have offered to run programs such as adapted surfing, horseback riding, outdoor living skills (setting up a tent), etc. that drive me to want do so something to contribute to humanity. It is my true hope to not only serve these children, but to provide a foundation and conduit for these amazing colleagues of mine to use their talents in a truly meaningful ways.This is where I draw my happiness and motivation in life; service to the community and making better childhoods for kids.THE CAUSE: In 2011, for my 30th birthday, I had the honor and privilege raising funds for The Children\\'s Trust - Tadworth, a charity in the United Kingdom that supports children with medical and special needs. As a result of overwhelming donor support, including Ninja Star Sushi Bar/Restaurant in San Jose, over $3000 USD (2000 GBP) was raised for this absolutely worthy cause.Currently, I serve as President/CEO of the MFCFNC, a non-profit (501(c)(3) (pending)) supporting children who require medically technology to sustain life. It is our purpose to connect these children with as \"normal\" as a childhood as possible. I want to use my involvement with the MFCFNC to help achieve my aforementioned goal of building a camp/hospital collaboration at some point. The MFCFNC\\'s existence revolves around \"Building better childhoods\". This is what we do: MFCFNC Mission Statement:The mission of The Medically Fragile Children\\'s Foundation of Northern \\nCalifornia (MFCFNC) is to serve children (up to 21 years of age), who \\nrequire medical technology and intervention to sustain life, and connect \\nthem with the innate experiences associated with growing up, just as \\ntheir peers without such limitations experience. The MFCFNC supports \\nchildren who reside in Santa Clara County, and its surrounding areas, and are consumers of \\nMedi-Cal\\'s \"pediatric subacute care\"/ \"pediatric day health center\" \\nprograms or similar services.If you would like to download a copy of our current Annual Report, which includes more detailed information about our Board, cause, past initiatives/events, and financial accountability/reporting, please visit our website at:  http://www.mfcfnc.org.***NOTE ABOUT DONATIONS /\\nTAX-DEDUCTIONS***:\\nThe MFCFNC currently carries a \"Charity\" status with the State of\\nCalifornia (Click\\nHERE for our Franchise Tax Board Determination Letter).

Unfortunately we lost our house almost completely. The brighside is that we are all okay and no one was hurt. If you know my father Alvaro Rico, you know that the house and his belongings is what he worked for. Every year we would place christmas lights and would enjoy seeing the joy of peoples faces. He is devestated and close to retirement. My siblings and I want to do everything we can to try and rebuild the house.All donations will go directly toward the purchase of backpack beds and warming items for the homeless living on the streets.Since as much as 20% of street sleeping homeless have suffered hypothermia or frostbite, our goal is to be able to purchase 100 backpack beds and related warming items, one for each unsheltered person in Cleveland we know of (a numberof whom are veterans, shelter-resitant, or often live in abandoned buildings), to help save their lives while living on the streets. These amazing waterproof and windproof backpack beds(winner of 7 International product design awards) can roll out to turn into a long mattress / tent-like sleeping area, to help keep the homeless warm and dry. Click on the videos down below to see a live demo in action, just how profound an impact it can have on someone who is homeless, and how these backpack beds can serve as an excellent tool for homeless outreach teams by helping them build a rapport with these clients in an effort to ultimately try and help get them housing and off of the streets.While our group often puts together backpacks of items (clothing, personal care, and food) for the homeless, we wanted to see if we could go one step further and get those individuals backpack beds to help keep them safe and warm this winter and beyond.

While attending, I had the opportunity to visit several unique places in Senegal and became aware of the disparities adolescence and youth face within the varying educational programs available. Mr. Waly Faye (liaison in Senegal) and program director at the West African Research Center (W.A.R.C.) has (in addition to directing us through the Study Abroad program) been a resident of the Niombato village who helped identify the need of a touring library in coalition with the Niombato Students Association. Mr. Faye as the president of Participatory Action for International Development (PAID) has described to me his broader plan to support literacy and education for middle and high school aged students. Within the broader plan is a specific plan to support a travelling library that will be accessible primarily to middle and high school students without fees or charges. The main goal is to allow people, particularly students of the community to have access to resources of knowledge and media outlets such as internet, books on their syllabus, general books, articles etc. The library will be settled in the easily accessible village of Karang in which Waly is a member of. In addition to the library center in Niombato there will be a touring part in each of the four villages with local middle schools hosting several of the books for two months before giving it back for another one. The initial phase that consists of locating an area, identifying its needs, and implementing a plan to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of the area based on the communities assets has been designed and implemented with the work of Mr. Faye and his position in the community. The second phase of the program, which encompasses fundraising, outreach, project analysis, book drives, and grant seeking has begun and will continue until the third and final development phase. This final stage, which will begin upon arrival in Dakar and begin with the purchasing of the requested amenities in addition to the development of the library in Niombato (Building shelves, tables, chairs, basic library/classroom development). I will be personally working with Mr. Faye from this point forward to deliver the books to the village as well as complete the final phase of the project which includes installing the library with the help of the Niombato Students Association.  Although some books may come from the United States there are large second hand book markets in Dakar that will be used primarily to purchase the books and materials required to create and sustain the project. The books received here will be used as additional books that will help develop the library beyond the needs of the students\\' basic course curriculum. Based on an analysis conducted $3000 will cover the three phases of the project, which will then be allocated to them as follows. Budget:Computers/E-Books:::::::::::::::.$1,200Travel/transportation::::::::::...$950*Shipment of books::::::::::::$500Tables:::::::::::::::::$200Chairs:::::::::::::::::$125Bookshelves::::::::::::::..$200 *International travel expenses will total an estimated cost of $1,500 - $1,600. While transportation costs are included and state an amount lower than this the budget will include a portion of this amount in addition to an estimated $70-$150 transportation costs of delivering the materials to Niombato.**Interested in donating books?

I was told to lay low and to let my body heal. Which for me is not the easiest thing to do.With my abundance of time and my need to occupy it, I taught myself to arm knit blankets.Hospitals are not the most happy of places, as some of you can imagine. Most of the people that were also patients looked like they needed some happiness and a little bit of hope in their lives. I am hoping to raise money to buy yarn so I can arm knitsome blankets for the people who need a little pick me up at the hospital.This means so much to me because of people like you. Throughout my illness, I have had friends and family reach out to me and pick me up when I needed it the most. I\\'m hoping to share the hope, love, and positive vibes to others who really need it as well. My goal is to make as many blankets as I can throughout the holiday season to spread a few smiles.update 3/7/17: We are so thankful for the support and generosity of shown here!

BitCon) adopted Rick Swydens non-profit organization Hotdogs for the Homeless as its charity of choice. Rick started this incredible organization as a way to reach out to the less fortunate by way of providing a weekly meal that many depend on. Alongside the meals come socks, toothbrushes, and other supplies that are often seen as staples by the fortunate among us, but as luxuries by some below the poverty line.The event is a 24-hour meet-up where we play video games live on the web to raise both funds and awareness for this important cause! There are various challenges, competitions, dares, sales, and auctions all along the way. RGS members who cant make it to the event can tune in via the web, as well as help raise money in the month prior to the game-a-thon.We will begin taking donations August 1st. This years stream goes live at 7PM, Friday September 4th. Last year we raised $4,500!All of the proceeds from our game-a-thon will be donated directly to assist Hotdogs for the Homeless operations. There are many reasons people fall below the poverty line and into homelessness, ranging from mental disability to PTSD to simply falling on hard times. HftH is a fantastic way to lend a helping hand to the less fortunate in a tangible, life impacting way. Unlike passing cash to a panhandler, you know where your donation goes and how it is spent. Whether they be unwed mothers, impoverished children, or the homeless: those who show up to benefit from Rick Swydens organizations generosity feel the difference your financial assistance makes. HftH provides toiletries, care, and meals for the impoverished and disadvantaged  a needed and appreciated service that we are proud to encourage and support.Thank you for your generosity in donating!Girls today have more opportunities than ever before, but many face barriers that prevent them from reaching their full potential. Your donations will help girls in the Newark & surrounding areas to find the confidence, courage and potential in themselves, and to realize that they matter.Your investment will provide the financial capital to empower girls to move through adolescence with confidence, see themselves as leaders, think critically about the world around them, and have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Girls; Live, Love. Laugh, Inc. is a nonprofit organization focusing on 6-17 year old girls living with limited resources in the inner city of Newark, New Jersey and surrounding areas. Our vision is to empower girls by building self esteem, proper etiquette, positive self respect, health/fitness and the importance of a higher education. We aim to make a difference by removing obstacles that stand in their way, so that they can become respectable, successful, productive and happy young ladies.There are nearly 630,000 homeless people in the United States, Linda and Nancy of Williamsport being two of them. After crossing paths with them today, their story touched my heart.   I offered them food, blankets, and money, all of which they kindly declined. They stated that they did not seek sympathy, but appreciated the offer. However, they did ask if I could do them one favor. Eager to help in any way that I could, of course, I without second thought, said yes. The lady responded, \"Could you please just keep us in your prayers?\" At a loss for words, I shook my head and agreed.   After talking to the mother and daughter for quite some time I got to know a bit about them. We also discussed the poor economic times, the amount of crime happening in the world, the greed of many landlords in Williamsport and surrounding areas, and a local shelter that has been unfortunately infested with bedbugs. Shortly after they reassured me they didn\\'t need anything more, and I was on my way.   Later this evening, I traveled the same road to pick up a friend, as it was thunderstorming pretty bad. I seen the two lovely ladies I talked to previous, curled up in their blanket trying to stay dry, my heart broke. Soon after seeing them I took them food, and a cold drink. It was the least I could do. We chatted a bit more, and I came to the realization that these ladies could really use some help getting back on their feet. How does one begin to rebuild their lives after hitting rock bottom? We\\'ve all been at a place in our lives where we have needed help but were too afraid to ask, as humans we like to have a sense of pride. With the cost of living so expensive and available jobs few and far between it can spiral downward fast.   It would be ideal to raise enough money to get these two back on their feet, and happy again. Let\\'s show them that there still is good in the world today. ALL PROCEEDS WILL GO STRICTLY TO HOUSING AND NECESSITIES FOR THESE TWO IN THEIR TIME OF NEED.  Thanks, and God Bless-Allyson UngardWe are, quite simply, a few of the people whose lives Jason has touched over the years. We are fellow co-workers who love and care about this man and want to help a good man who is dealing with a bad hand. Who is this Jason? Let us tell you a little about him and what we hope to accomplish.Jason West, Radiology Tech Extraordinare, has been battling health issues for some time now and is no longer able to work. He, along with his wife Linda, is helping care for their grandchild as well and we want to help him out with his Healthcare costs as well as any financial needs he and his family have faced and surely will be facing down the road. The funds we raise here will be presented to Jason and his family before Christmas.Your help with this will mean a great deal to not only us, but to the West family as well and you can rest assured that you are helping a truly deserving human being. For those that know Jason, we\\'ve no doubt that you are aware of this man\\'s love for people and passion for what he does. We truly miss him and his fanny pack of who knows what - he would never let us X-ray it for contents, lol - and we pray you will help us be the difference and example of what love looks like. We do ask that, should you have the opportunity to speak with him before Christmas, that you not mention this to him only for the sake of surprising him.

It is their goal to spread awareness of the warning signs of suicide risk and eliminate the stigma surrounding suicide and mental health issues to help reduce the number of adolescents dying by suicide. Stand Up and Speak also recognizes that, unless and until such stigmas are overcome it will continue to be a major barrier to the treatment of mental illnesses and to the prevention of suicide.Help us shed a brighter light into this often taboo subject and take steps forward to saving more lives by leaving a small donation!Hello everyone!Due to violence in Kenya, the program has been relocated to South Africa.I am so excited to serve in Durban, South Africa,withHOPE Worldwide\\'sHOPE Youth Corps!

I am now in Africa and I am providing aid in the countries I am moving through by giving my strength in their fields and helping out anyway I can in the villages I walk through. It has been a dream of mine to search for the movement of people and their way of life. Through practice I have morphed this into finding good people and exposing them for their kindness and still using movement as my motivation. Originally I was going to walk the whole way but recent events have brought a change to my outlook on this journey and I have decided to make it to South Africa any way I can. I have already made it through Scotland, England, France, Spain, Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, The Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso and am currently in Niger. I\\'m going to make it one way or another. With famine, Ebola outbreaks, lack of clean water, sanitary food, hostile zones, kidnappings and wild life, it will be a real feat to complete this journey. We will need sponsorships which I am hoping will come from more then just friends and family. I see that we have the ability help make a difference in people\\'s lives and it\\'s happening. With frequent updates onWww.youtube.com/user/xreilloand weekly blog postings onWww.xavierreillo.comChapters will include food, music, dance, transportation, boarder crossing and living as the locals do. Its my approach to traveling that explores ways to survive when you are not in your homeland. Videos and interviews will be about a minute long and no editing will take place until after I get home. Those videos will be the content for the documentary. I am also writing a book with the content I get from my weekly blog postings. In order to survive I will have to adapt to things that arise which we\\'re not planned for. I am asking the public to join in on a quest to show that traveling is safe and inexpensive and to expose the good people that help along the way. At times it will not be glamorous and the realities of life in different countries is sometimes desperate. Year in Africa will shine some light on this by bringing awareness to life outside of our own stomping grounds.It\\'s safe to travel in numbers, at times so when you see a fellow traveler don\\'t be afraid to say hello, you never know what kind of an adventure they could take you on!CHRISTNET CENTER FOR THE HOMELESSTHE GOAL: Provide a Day Center for the homeless across Western Wayne CountyWhat is ChristNet? A place where the homeless can go during the day and sign up for emergency housing every night. Where they can shower. Where they can do laundry. Where they can meet with counselors who will assist them in getting back on their feet. Where they can get a meal or two. Where they can be OFF the streets!To improve upon the cramped church basement space we presently rent, ChristNet has purchased a more suitable building. But we still need to fund extensive renovations, bringing it up to code. The new floor plan includes a commercial kitchen, plus showers and laundry machines, so that hot nourishing meals can be prepared on site and personal hygiene needs of ChristNet guests can be fully met. All renovation and installation work has to be completed in the new space before we can open its doors to serve the homeless.Located in the heart of the Downriver, ChristNet is a non-profit serving the homeless for more than 20 years. Hundreds of community-minded volunteers from over 55 churches not only staff the ChristNet daytime program but also host the homeless overnight from October through June each year.Our desire is to have a welcoming place where the homeless can go during the day, as well as enroll for overnight housing at our partnering host churches. All funds raised go directly to the build-out! We invite your donation to this important project.Remember Matthew 25:35: For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger and you invited me in.Hello Nebraska City and other supporters. We are raising money to get a new shuttle for the citizens of Nebraska City and all of its visitors that use the service. The current van is getting to be a money trap and sadly won\\'t last much longer. So we are reaching out to the public to help get the word out and raise the money to keep the Safe Ride up and running. For those of you that are unaware of what the Safe Ride is and does let us tell you alittle about it. The service runs Friday and Saturday nights 8pm-2am in Nebraska City giving FREE rides to those who might have consumed to much alcohol and make the smart and safesafe choice to get home or to another destination. We give free rides from your home to the bars, bar to bar, bar to home and home to home. All of our drivers are volunteer and donate their time. Please help keep this service going andand keep the roads a little safer.We\\'ve all been so fortunate to experience yet another year of Louisville sports that was loaded with fun and excitement. With both the calendar year and the 2014 Cardinal football season about to come to a close, it feels like the perfect time to give a little something back.With this spirit in mind, Card Chronicle has teamed up with the YMCA of Greater Charlotte to try and send some extremely deserving children from Charlotte\\'s west corridor to the Belk Bowl so they can cheer on the Cards on Dec. 30.For those of you who can\\'t make it down to Charlotte for the big game, this is a wonderful opportunity to send someone deserving in your place. For those of you who can, it\\'s just a wonderful opportunity.If you don\\'t have the means to donate, then don\\'t think twice about it. If you do, then any amount you are able to spare will be incredibly appreciated.Thank you so much, and happy holidays to you and your loved ones.--MikePlease join us in raising funds for the Aphasia Recovery Connection - who has a mission of helping ending the isolation of those recoverying from aphasia. Like Chris. And over one million in the USA alone. Aphasia affects language - but not his intellect.As many of you know, Chris suffered a massive stroke on Dec. 28, 2012 following ACL knee surgery. His goal prior to surgery was to run his first Ironman race for which he was training. After suffering the stroke he was completely paralized on the right side and had a complete loss of speech. He was determined to gethis strength back after his stroke to run again. He has done several small runs in our local area but is on his way to Iceland to run his first Marathon on Aug. 23, 2014 (just 20 months post stroke).His right side will never be 100% but 90% seems to be good enough for him to run. He still has severe speech problemsand will deal with that for years to come. Chris is not alone to suffer what is called Aphasia and Apraxia among young people. Before he had his stroke we didn\\'t know what those words were. In January of 2013 hecame across ARC (Aphasia Recovery Connection). This is a total volunteer group of people with Aphasia and Apraxia due to strokes or brain injury who are trying to make isolation amongst the sufferers come to an end. The organizations founders aretwo young adults, Christine Huggins and David Dow,who suffered from strokes and with their parents helpthey want to make it easier for young adults to cope with their issues. Many of them had very prominent careers which came to a complete halt as did Chris\\' career. Chris has turned to them to make many new friends who communicate with him in their own wayto try to make the most of their lives. ARC has no fundingat this time and is working on getting a nonprofit status. It is a social networking site which had about 600 members in January when Chris joined and now hasover 2500 members. Since the organization is only a few years old and it is growing in leaps and bounds they can surely useany donations that you can provide to help support them to make the lives of other people with Aphasia and Apraxia get help in their recovery. Especially at this time when insurances are cutting back on therapeutic treatment, ARC will be there for them. You can visit their site and join the group on  www.aphasiarecoveryconnection.orgChris is dedicating his run to ARCso pleasehelp by making a donation. Thank you for your prayers for the 26.2 mile run Chris completed without walking - he ran the whole way! And thank you to those who are continuing to keep the campaign going to raise funds for the Aphasia Recovery Connection!Hello Wonderful People:My name is Mary Dedeke and after spending 2 years serving in my community locally, I have been granted the opportunity to serve for 27 months in Rwanda.There is one obstacle that would make my time abroad extremely hard and that would be paying $360 every month for my Wells Fargo private loans. As we all know, private loans are hard to pay off, have high interest rates, and do no offer forbearance. Unfortunately, this leaves me in a tough place and I am asking for your help. This fund would go straight to my private loans so I can focus on my work while serving in Rwanda for 27 months.My blog will launch in July so that you can follow my journey, ask questions, and learn what it is like to live and work in Rwanda.Thank you for your time and consideration! If you any questions please do not hesistate to contact me.Our new company is running a campaign to raise funds to be able to Donate Bedside Healer stuffed animals, to deserving kids throughout 2014!

We will partner with charitable organizations to get Healers into the right hands! We will spread hope and some smiles throughout 2014, and we won\\'t be able to do it without YOU!

Jazakalah!This summer, Noelle will swim 1.5 miles across Province Lake in East Wakefield, NH to raise money to purchase fun items for Tufts Floating Hospital for Children in Boston. She has been an outpatient since the age of 5 when she was diagnosed with a rare spinal condition. Each time she went through a procedure or difficult situation, the hospital would provide a prize or reward which kept her spirits up. When she endured a 1:30 minute MRI in Feb of 2014, she noticed that the reward closet was quite empty. Seeing as though the small reward was so important to her throughout her time at Tufts, she has decided to raise money to fill their closets and bring smiles to inpatients and outpatients at the hospital. NOELLE\\'S STORYNoelle was diagnosed with Dysplastic spondylolisthesis at the age of 5. (Dysplastic spondylolisthesis is a rare congenital spondylolisthesis occurring because of a malformation of the lumbosacral junction resulting in small, incompetent facet joints.) I know that\\'s a lot of medical lingo. Basically, Noelle 4th Lumbar is slipped and twisted over the 5th squeezing the spinal cord. Certain movements or falls could cause paralysis. Noelle was placed in a rigid back brace for 3 years. During those 3 years, she couldn\\'t play outside, participate in physical education, recess or even ride a bike. It was a very difficult time but she remained consistently positive. She found ways to keep herself busy with sewing, piano and reading. Last summer her doctor said that although her condition remained, it had stabilized to a degree where she would be able to do some physical activity and slowly wean from the brace. In October, Noelle began swimming and loved every moment of it. In January, she joined a swim team and recently had her first swim meet! She is slowly regaining strength and muscle and thriving in the pool. Noelle Gregoire in her first rigid back brace at age 5. She wore a brace 24 hours a day for 3 years. In the summer of 2013, she was weaned off the brace. Although her condition remains, she is stable enough to not need it every day.Where does the money go? 1. Open Support Groups for Suicide, Self Injury, and/or depression.2. Continue to host charity outreach parties for homeless youths.3. File non-profit status4. Start business employing homeless individuals.#30ways30days Fun-Raiser 30 Ways, 30 People, 30 Days to spread awareness starting May 18th through June 18th. Each day will represent a new person/organization and their \"task\" to spread love or raise awareness. Our goal is to raise $35,000 for homeless and/or suicidal youths and adults.My name is Arielle Caputo and I am a Suicide Intervention Coach. I volunteer my time running an in-person suicide support group for teens and adults here in Los Angeles, CA as well as a Virtual Support Group.If you are like me, I didn\\'t pay attention to suicide. I didn\\'t truly understand it nor did it mean much to me... It was just about sad people way out there somewhere in the world. Then, it home when I lost a dear friend and that got me thinking... Why do we only pay attention when we lose someone dear to us? Why aren\\'t we doing what it takes to help those who are depressed, sad, or lonely before they even reach a point to having suicidal thoughts?I went through a period in my own life where I was on the brink of tears 24/7, feeling lonely, depressed and just...well plain stuck. I decided enough was enough. That maybe there were others like me who felt the same way, that maybe I could be the ear for those who needed to talk, or be the shoulder to lean on, or the helping hand... So I started my Instagram (ariellecaputo) and started my Organization (DEAP in Love)  www.deapinlove.com just hoping to inspire others.So here I am; excited and passionate and certain I can show others how to transition out of depression. It is my goal to spread love to every corner of the world to help reach out to those before suicide seems their only answer.DEAP in Love is our lifestyle, our passion our revolution; our contribution to the world, and we need your help to make this happen. Together, we can save a life. Help me make this not a dream, but a reality.Funds go towards opening and filing for the non profit. Hiring, Feeding, clothing homeless individuals. Opening more free Support Groups across the country...From the bottom of our hearts, Thank You for your time and contribution.Please visit www.deapinlove.com to follow us and stay up to date with what we are doing in our community. www.facebook.com/pages/DEAPWe all dearly love Michael ...

Well, just gave out almost everything within a couple of hours of hitting the underpasses of uptown. It\\'s becoming increasingly more clear to me how little I have to complain about in my life, and how little others are scraping by with. It\\'s going to be damn cold tomorrow, and predictably so for a few months now. I plan on continuing to make these little bags to hand out, but I\\'d like do it on a slightly larger scale.Many of you asked how you could help. I\\'d love to make many, many more of these. Possibly to the point that I can pass them out to some of you, to disperse as you seem fit. Almost 200 people cared enough to \"like\" my post, at a dollar a person, a goal of $250 is almost met, allowing meto make almost 40 more packages.Included in these packages are:socksfeminine hygiene productscleansing wipeshand warmerschapstick (its cold and dry)a snacktoothbrushq-tipsa mylar solar blanket (blocks wind, holds in heat)gum (who doesn\\'t love gum?)I\\'m also happy to take donations of jackets/gloves/hats/winter wear.Please feel free to share.Dear Friends and Family,Please considerdonating to the Clothe, Educate and Feed a Child (\"CEFAC\") Foundation,a non-profit organization thatfocuses on the development of under-privileged children in Ghana.Funds received will assist in establishing the organization and providing food, clothing and books to two orphanages in Ghana: Tsiveto Children\\'s Fund and Marfo Children Care Foundation.

Merry Christmas Nina and Daniel and let this be the start to an amazing 2017 for you both.A local Staten Island family needs our help... Sean Torres Sr is a dedicated family man and Commandant of the Staten Island Marine Corps League detachment. He devotes almost all of his time to the mission of the Detachment and the betterment of the community by working with local charitable organizations and donating his own personal time and resources to children with special needs; persons in assisted living facilities; the community in general; and both the active duty and reserve Marines of the nearby Marine Corps Reserve unit through cookouts, individual recognition and donations both personal and monetary to those in need. During Superstorm Sandy, Sean tirelessly coordinated and led the efforts of the Staten Island Detachment in acquiring and distributing relief supplies throughout Staten Island and Brooklyn virtually 24 hours a day. He was always available and always involved making sure the needs of those impacted were addressed and that all we could do to help was done. He did this despite having lost his entire home and almost everything he and his family owned to that very same storm.In the days weeks and months that followed, Sean (retired due to medical disablity), worked to secure a contractor in order to rebuild his home where he had raised his family, while paying rent for temporary lodging after the insurance ran.Ater some time and a great deal of money it became clear that the contractor was not getting the job done and the money was being squandered. Due to the trauma associated with being so harshly displaced from their home and the subsequent troubles with the re-building process, Sean and his family felt it best to move on and start their life fresh in a new home far from the painful memories.In negotiating with their mortgage company, Sean was able to put the remnants of his home on the market for a short sale and identified a motivated buyer, while still making the mortgage payments on the destroyed property as well as his current housing expenses.Shortly afterwards, Sean, his wife and his son all ended up committed to the hospital in rapid succession for a myriad of health issues and procedures, leading to mounting medical bills not all covered by their insurance.While still recovering from their medical issues, the City informed Sean that his old house would have to be torn down and that if he did not do it immediately, they would do so and bill him the costs. This put an end to the short sale and Sean\\'s ability to finally get out from under the crushing and mounting financial burden that circumstances have put upon him. We are trying to help Sean and his family by raising the funds necessary to cover the cost of the demolition of the old house. Any help you can give to someone who always has, and will always continue to, give so much of himself, would be greatly appreciated.Sean epitomizes what it means to be a Marine... he is selfless and giving and always puts the needs of others ahead of himself. We need to now put his needs first. Please give in whatever amount you are able, to show our appreciation of someone who is a fine example of what it means to be truly selfless and human. Thank you so much!Please join us as we honor David John Riggs at the THIRD AnnualDASH FOR DAVID 5k walk / run!Saturday December 19th, 2015Como Lake, St. Paul MN8am packet pick-up / 9am race startDavid John Riggs was tragically killed by a distracted driver outside of his family home in Oakdale.

Please forward this link to everyone and anyone you can think of that would like to join us in our celebration. You will lose someone you cant live without and your heart will be badly broken, and the bad news is that you never completely get over the loss of your loved one but this is also the good news. They live forever in your broken heart that doesnt seal back up and you come through. Its like having a broken leg that never heals perfectlybut you learn to dance with the limp~*Thank you all so very much for being a part of this event. Together we will all KEEP ON MOVING for David!~Many have asked about honoring Tina with flowers or something like that. Please don\\'t! It would be a waste of flowers. We would much rather have any money you\\'d spend on something like that put towards a cause that Tina really cared about it.Most of you know that Tina struggled with substance abuse for muchof her life. During her many years of sobriety in between relapses, she often donated her time, money and resources to the Lavender Street.Lavender street is drug treatment center focusing on substance abuse treatment services. Providing substance abuse treatment with outpatient care, residential short-term treatment, and residential long-term treatment. Women, including those who are pregnant or post-partem, beds for children of the client, and criminal justice clients are supported for drug rehab.In addition to befriending the women receiving treatment at Lavender Street,Tina donated much of her time, money and resources in other ways. Care packages for new admissions, christmas presents for the children of the women in treatment, easter baskets... the list goes on. Eventually, Lavender street began calling Tina each time they received a new admission.Tina cared deeply for these women, and she\\'d be thrilled to know her passing could raise awareness for the organization that helped them so much. By donating to this campaign you will be technically donating the money to Tina\\'s family, but do so with the knowledge that every dime of this money will be donated as one big fat check upon completion of the fundraiser.Thank you for helping us honor Tina in this way.Joe and father-in-law Herb Pagewith first bones    of Jimmy found in 2011.Help \"Jimmy\" the Diplodocus Speak up for the Burpee museum and the National Parkinson Foundation. \"Any donation can help preserve the world and change the world\"My name is Joseph Mongan and Im an amateur paleontologist. Ive been going on Burpee Expeditions for the last 8 years through the Burpee Museum of Natural Historyin Rockford Illinois. During a hot day in June of 2011, I found the first bone of a rare, juvenile long-necked Diplodocus dinosaur, that the museum will exhibit when preparation of the bones is complete. I had the privilege of naming this rare dinosaur Jimmy, after my father James W. Mongan. My father suffered from Parkinsons disease for many years, and even had 2 deep brain stimulators put into his brain to help control his movements. I have seen the effects that Parkinsons disease has on a person. He passed away in January 2011. That year started out tough for me in many ways. After my father passed I had a job change and started my own business. If not for winning a free trip to the expedition in Utah at the annual Burpee fundraiser, I would have not gone in 2011. You could say things happen for a reason.I recently learned that the Burpee Museum is in urgent need of financial help for their paleontology program. I would also like to raise money for National Parkinson Foundation because I believe in their mission \"Toimprove the quality of care for people with Parkinsons disease through research, education and outreach\". The funds raised will be split 50/50 between these originations. Funds for Burpee museum will support the staff, students, lab and expeditions so that the scientific and educational work will continue. Why is this so important? Over the last several years, the United States continuously falls behind other developed countries, like Japan, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Canada and France, in the area of science literacy. We need to inspire more children and adults to learn about science. Paleontology is a known gateway science and paleontology related exhibits are a huge attendance draw at natural history museums all over the world. For several years I have been helping Burpee Museum excavate Late Jurassic (150 Million Year Old) dinosaurs from the Hanksville -Burpee Dinosaur Quarry, near Hanksville, Utah. This immense bonebed was discovered in 2008 and was listed by National Geographic as one of the TOP TEN FOSSIL FINDS for that year. The site is massive and preserves skeletons of dozens of dinosaurs that washed up onto sandbars in a large river. Jimmy is a juvenile, long necked dinosaur called a Diplodocus. Burpee expeditons have found approximately 50% complete so far, this dinosaur appears to be only 1/3 grown. When mounted it may be 35-40 feet in length, whereas an adult Diplodocus could reach over 100! This dinosaur could give paleontologists more information on how dinosaurs grew up and what changes they went through. This information can make a contribution to people of my lifetime and beyond. Please help Jimmy to speak up for science, to speak up for everyones ability to discover the wonders of nature, and to speak up for families with a loved one who suffers from Parkinsons disease.The National Parkinson Foundation listened to my story, and wants to be involved in this fundraising goal. When you can make a donation the funds will help in starting to prepare the bones of Jimmy. This will take 2 years to complete. Many staff hours and volunteer hours go into prepping a dinosaur. Estimated costs are $125,000. Imagine what another $125,000 could do for Parkinsons patients care and further research. See links below and follow Burpee Museum to get updates on the ongoing Burpee Expeditions dig of 2015. You may even want to help and join us on an expedition. Yes even you can go on an adventure of a lifetime. Want to just tour the site?

This will be the first time he will be able to travel to Australia.Even the smallest of contributions will go a long way and Chauncey will be very grateful as this is his first and last year to compete as a Junior Pro.We are the J.C.

All teams that qualified for regionals and states have 3 sets of\\nuniforms (one for each round) and that is where we want to be! We are a young team with a lot of\\ntalent and spunk! This is why we are here - asking for your help to enable us\\nto get new uniforms. \\n\\nDue to limited resources within our school district and athletic department\\nthere is no money available for the school to purchase the uniforms.

I was lying in my bed in a crummy little apartment on the outskirts of the University of Colorado campus in Boulder. It was a quarter to four. If I didn\\'t leave now I would be late to my honors class. 4:00 pm. Class had started. 4:15 pm. I wasn\\'t going. I couldn\\'t move. I was afraid to move. I was afraid that if I got up from bed it wouldn\\'t be to go to the academically rigorous course that I obviously needed to attend, but to do something that would hurt myself in an irrecoverable way. So I lay there, and watched the late afternoon sunlight filter through the window shade and make patterns on the wall.\"For the entire fall semester Id been slipping, sinking into a deep depression that left me unable to care about much of anything, myself included. I quit college in the spring feeling weak, feeling like a failure, and uncertain that I would ever be strong enough to go back. That I would ever be strong again.\"In the midst of trying to put myself back together I went to a Denver Roller Dolls bout at the 1STBANK Center. I felt a lot of things, but the overpowering feeling was awe. Here were women. They cavorted around the track with strength, confidence, and an infectious joy. They were pummeling each other one minute and then dancing unabashedly between jams. And while I understood very little about the actual game, I knew that I wanted to play it. I wanted the strength and self-acceptance I saw in them.\"I wont say derby saved me. Therapy and medication and the support of my family and friends saved me. But derby helped me redefine myself. It gave me a dream to work towards and a way to believe in myself again. It reminded me that I was strong and gave me a community. I belonged now to this Island of Misfit Toys, and they took me in, broken parts and all.\"Supporting roller derby does so much more than just helping a team pay for travel expenses. It creates a space where women can reclaim their voice. It develops a community where men view women as equals and even as role models. And it raises a generation of junior derby skaters who grow up believing in the potency of their own power.\" \\'The flat track revolution\\' isn\\'t just a catchphrase; its a reality. At least it has been for me, even long after I graduated from college and stopped making terrible art therapy paintings. Your generosity keeps the revolution rolling. We have a lot of great plans for the league  completing construction at our facility, sending MHC to playoffs and beyond- but your donation goes farther than that. It helps people get up when theyve been knocked down, on the track and in life. And it even comes with some sweet prizes! Were grateful to everyone that has contributed in the past  to our fans, friends, family, sponsors, volunteers, and alumnis. Derby is built on the backs of the ones who have gone before, and we know we could not be where we are today without your support. We ask that you donate to help us keep rolling.\"Lauren \"Shadow\" Salvador #129| Mile High Club Co-Captain 2014Special Edition T-Shirt.

This time it\\'ll be inKhanty-Mansiysk, Russia! March 23rd - April 6th.As you all may know, I was on the 2011 team for the Winter Deaflympics in Slovakia but unfortuately the event had to be cancelled. I was able to refund all the money back to the people who donated, and now I have to start fresh!$3,700 will cover the flight to Russia, the uniforms and food/boarding.I also need to raise moneyto cover the flight to the airport and other fees and expenses. http://2015deaflympics.org/en/My Dad, Jim Mowery, was at the last Cubs World Series Game on October 10, 1945 when the Cubs lost to the Tigers. He\\'s been a loyal and dedicated fan for 71 years ever since then.\\n\\nHe was lucky enough to see Game 3 at Wrigley Field, which was a dream come true. And, after going down 3-1 in this series, it appeared that his story might just end there.\\n\\nBut, now that the Cubs have won Game 6, many of us think that he should go to Cleveland and see Game 7. He\\'d be one of the only people to have seen BOTH Game 7\\'s. And, maybe this will be redemption for 1945.\\n\\nThis is being pulled together less than 20 hours before game time, so it\\'s a tall order. But, it seems that many Cubs fans around the country (and even outside the USA) have found a connection with his story. I\\'m thinking that maybe there\\'s enough support to help find him a flight, a hotel, and a ticket. It would be nice if it was for two, so he could bring along someone from the family to enjoy the game with him.\\n\\nIf you feel the same, please help this effort by either donating, or sharing this post. And, a big thank you to everyone who has sent their love to him this playoff season. It\\'s truly been an amazing journey.

We have 12 talented, skilled young ladies who not only work hard on the field, but who also maintain high academics in order to participate. We competed in the Wescon Regional Cheer Competition in Phoenix, AZ on Saturday, November 19 with excitement as we had the opportunity to show off our routine. We all HOPED for a first or second place trophy, but knowing we were competing with nine teams we knew that it was not going to be an easy task. The girls worked hard, cheered their hearts out and earned 2nd Place in the competition. 1st and 2nd Place winners have the opportunity to advance to Nationals in Orlando, FL. This is a DREAM COME TRUE to our girls. This money will be used to help our girls fly to Florida for the Pop Warner National Competition the first week of December. We will be able to pay our National Fees and book our rooms at the resort, which is mandatory of all participants. We would have the chance to Fly into Florida, attend our Practice Day, attend our Performance Day and then fly home. Although a short trip, this will be an experience of a lifetime for our TEAM!We have just two weeks to prepare for this competition! Such a short time, but it was so unexpected that we didn\\'t prepare for this opportunity ahead of time. Our girls have a lot of work ahead of them to make this DREAM a REALITY. We would greatly appreciate your support. This will be the FIRST time Lake Havasu City has had a team qualify for Nationals since 2008. This is a HUGE accomplishment for not only our girls, but our Pop Warner Association - Lake Havasu Youth Football & Cheer.DREAMS CAN COME TRUE! Against all odds some how, some way, I have been accepted to run the qualifying course of SASUKE 32 in Japan!!! THIS SATURDAY! April 23rd. This is crazy because they very rarely let any international competitors compete at all! EVER! This has been a dream for so long ever since I saw Sasuke 9 years ago and I have been making that dream come closer every year! I didnt know how or when but I knew If I kept at it just like everything else in my life that doors would open and opportunities would present themselves, and they did! Unfortunately this has been very bad timing because I am currently doing Sasuke in Vietnam and they just told me. My finances have been exhausted just from getting out here and now I will have to change my flight and then book a one way back to the states. (Not the cheapest thing last minute) Then if I pass Sasuke qualifying round (which consists of push ups, sit ups, running etc) I will have to come back in about month or so to actually compete on the show. With your help we can make this happen! Also anyone who donates $25 or more I will send them a high quality comfy fabric Reko Rivera t-shirt (sizes are limited at the moment) fb message me your size and address. Thank you for everyone who has believed in me and supported me along the way. The messages and comments about inspiring others is worth all the hard work, time, and dedication put into this silly dream of mine. If I can inspire just one kid to follow his dreams and live a positive life then I think its all worth it :-) I will do my best to represent USA in this amazing event!My son, Justice Peter has been chosen to represent Alaska for Cross Country in the upcoming 2015 Down Under Sports, In Australia scheduled for June 30, 2015.

Everyone in our little community, from the kids at his school to the adults who love to watch him play Santa every year at the Christmas concert, adore Derik! His big smile melts everyone\\'s heart and can truly light up a room. As you can see from the picture, Derik adores his dad. He loves going to basketball and hockey games with his dad! Derek\\'s mom and dad are avid bike riders. They have ridden the past few years in the Special Olympic Torch Ride.  This year the ride falls on the day before Derik is having his his 13th surgery on May 5th. This one is a spinal fusion for scoliosis. As his family and friends we would love to see Derik get to participate in this ride with his parents, as well as go on many future rides with his family. We are trying to raise money to buy a tandem bike that is adapted for special needs. This bike would allow Derik to ride with his dad and to feel like he actually riding a bike! He will get to go FAST! Derik loves going FAST! Derik is facing weeks and weeks of time in bed recovering from this surgery, and this opportunity will give him such a great send off, and lots of exciting memories to think about during the not-so-fun times. Because the bike has to be specially made, we need to raise the money very quickly so it can be done in time for the Torch Ride. Any help, no matter how small, will make a huge difference for Derik.

The team, which received no funding from the School District of Philadelphia, was able to compete only thanks to a tremendous outpouring of support from Philadelphias civic community.In order to quicklyraise the needed funds to pay for the trip, former Mayor Michael Nutter secured $20,000 each from the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. Those transformative donations  combined with over $21,000 raised from alumni and families of Central High School and the general public through a GoFundMe campaign  allowed 39 student team members to travel to St. Louis to compete. The financial support we received was particularly important because it ensured that every student was able to attend at no cost to their families  a crucial achievement for a team from Central High School, where 60 percent of students come from economically disadvantaged families. Beyond funding the World Championship trip, the $70,000 raised last year closed a budget deficit and allowed long-deferred upgrades to tools and equipment.(Appeal continues below the infographic)The RoboLancers have emerged as a leader of Philadelphia robotics teams, providing financial assistance or weekly student mentorship to six other teams. They serve approximately 55 additional teams each year by hosting citywide robotics competitions and workshops where teams from different schools come together to share tools and materials, and learn from each other. Their Philly Robotics Expo, now in its sixth year, brings in hundreds of K12 school children each spring for a full day of workshops, activities, and demonstrations.Because of this work, the RoboLancers won the Chairmans Award at the Mid-Atlantic Robotics regional championship this past Saturday for the second year running. The Chairmans Award is the most prestigious award in FIRST robotics  each year just two out of the 121 teams in the Mid-Atlantic region receive this honor. The award is a testament to the RoboLancers continued work to expand outreach efforts, providing opportunities for children in schools across Philadelphia to get excited about STEM.We leveraged last years successful season to secure additional recurring funding for our team that has enabled us to redouble outreach efforts aimed at expanding access to STEM educational opportunities for students at other schools across Philadelphia. Although we have taken advantage of this additional funding to strengthen our teams own finances, we had no idea that we would win this prestigious award again this year. (We had budgeted for another World Championship trip in two or three years, not one!)We are thus seeking at least $35,000 in outside support, which, combined with the teams own resources, will again permit us to send about 40 team members, along with chaperones, to the World Championship.

My name is Pablo Carela, I am a Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitor, and instructor inThe South Bronx who is involved in a community project aimed at bringing the beautiful art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to underprivivileged and sometimes marginalized children from different areas of The Bronx at no charge, children who would otherwise never experience such a wonderful and benefiting activity without our time and effort. Our project is very young and still growing; it is funded by our own instructors and some adult practitioners who donate uniforms, spaces, and instruction. It is our dream to send some of our intructorswho need more training and better exposure to high level Jiu-Jitsu instruction on a educational assignment to Brazil, a mission to acquire different techniques and methods of translating BJJ to children. We\\'ve contacted educators, trainers and competitors not only in our art/sport but in physical conditioning as well, by whom we will be guided during our stay there on how to be better prepared as coaches and bring back knowledge and skills-sets to empower our community through healthy living. I am one of those instructors, but due to my constricting economic situation I am unable to even thinking of such an endeavor without your help, I would be traveling with my seven year old son and the cost of visas and air-fares for us both is out of my reach and it is imposible for my budget at this moment. I have contacts in Brazil who are also in a nessecitous condition but are more thanwilling to aid me with lodging and food as is the only thing they in their precarious situation can do. I will be most thankful to all those who can contribute to this cause, for this journey would be impossible without your generosity, and hopefully you can also come by to enjoy Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with us and partake in the education of our children and help us in building a better community through athletics and health education.This is my friend Nanette Luna from Maria High school, she is a single mother who did all the right things to raise her kids alone.

The Eagles are mid season in a fight for playoffs when tragedy strikes #8 and is diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. He is a 17 year student athlete and just like he plays on the gridiron he is prepared to fight!! Unfortunately, with this fight comes a tremendous strain on him and his family. They will have to pay for things we don\\'t often think about like transportation, medication, office visits and not to mention lost time at work for his very supportive Father Sean and Mother Lanai. As most of you know in football we are all considered family. Along with his 5 siblings we are here for each other!! We are asking everyone to donate to Tyreon\\'s family to ease their burden so they can fight this awful disease head on without the worry of the little things! Please help out our family!The Ice Hockey Club at NC Stateis a completely student-run and primarly student-funded organization that strives to provide the best college hockey experience to our players. We recently received permission to convert an old snack bar at our rink into a new locker room and new home for our team. It will feature 27-30 individual player stalls along with showers, and an equipment workbench.This new locker room will provide our student-athletes with a wide variety of benefits, one of the most prominent being equipment storage. Many players currently must store their equipment in dorm rooms or leave it in their car due to the smell. Such situations can cause the build up of dangerous bacteria such as staph and the unpleasant feeling of putting on wet, ice cold equipment before a practice or game. Please help us provide our players with a healthier and greater overall college hockey experience by supporting this project. Any donation amount is extremely helpful in making this possibility a reality. Thank you.See below for rewards you can claim for your donation! In addition to donating, we ask that you please share our campaign via facebook and twitter to help spread the word! Thank you!

That\\'s Team Manser-Joe. Together, they\\'ve competed in triathlons and marathons on both coasts and they\\'re planning to take ontheir first IronMan in Florida this fall. Their goal is to break the World Record time for a blind athlete of 11 hours and 50 minutes. And you know what? They can totally do it, if we take one last challenge out of their way.Erich has a degenerative condition called retinitis pigmentosa that has been robbing him of his sight since he was a kid. So now he relies on other elite athleteslike Stephan to guide him in every event he enters. They ride a tandem bike, but the one Erich has now isn\\'t worthy of his talents. It\\'s just too small for a guy as BIG as he is -- in size, ambition and heart.So let\\'s break the cycle of bad equipment, steer some funds their way and help them take the ride of their lives.The South Troy Dodgers 12 U team had a vision and dream that began 10 months ago when the team was created. This special group of young men has realized this dream with capturing andgoing undefeated in the AABC 12 U Pee Wee Reese North Atlantic Regional tourney in Tuxedo, NY. Now, they won\\'t stop at just getting to the World Series, they now want to WIN the World Series. Any amount of contribution will help with airfare and lodging for the team.

We bothplay professional soccer in the National Women\\'s Soccer League for Sky Blue FC. Rocky has been nominated for an ESPN ESPY award for the BEST FEMALE COLLIGIATE ATHLETE. She is a member of the Costa Rican National team, part of the National Championship team at Penn State, the 2015 MAC HERMANN trophy winner, and was a second overall draft pick in the 2016 NWSL draft.None of the expenses (hotel, flights, food) are covered for her trip to LA for the award ceremony and we want to make sure sheisable to receive this honorable accolade. We would love to make this trip extra special by flying her father in from Costa Ricato accompany her. We know it would mean the world to Rockyto have her role model by her sideon this memorable day.We have 3 weeks to collect the funds as Rocky will depart for the awards ceremony on July 11.My Mom is Pat Kelly. She\\'s been a Tri-Valley resident since the 60s and Living in Pleasanton since 1971. Pat married John Kelly in 1968 and two children, Katie and Maggy. In Mom\\'s past lives, she was an avid skiier, even planning school to ski during winter quarter and taking classes during summer quarter. Her dad paid for the season lift ticket! She also raced cars, and that\\'s how she met my dad. They had many neat cars, the most known was the family Lotus 7A. The kids were in on the racing, too, known as Auto-X. Mom won many national championships!We are raising money for final expenses and medical expenses. We may need more than the amount needed. We are modest and are uncomfortable asking for money. The money will also be used for general bills still coming to the house.We will need things pretty quickly. Mom has been living off of social security and the reverse mortgage, which may/will stop at the beginning of November. Maggy has been living with Mom and as this has been written, is currently unemployed.This means so much to us because there has been no final planning for the estate and we were lucky to get Power of Attorney just a few days ago.We will be so thankful. Every little bit helps.Thank you so much, everyone.Jake Carey(11 yrs) has been selected to represent our nation on the USA-LABC 12U baseball team.5000+ players try out for the 9-18U USA-LABC teams annually at 22 national tryout events held all across the United States.

Confirmed teams are: Dominican Republic, British Virgin Islands, St. Croix, USA, Canada and Venezuela with multiple teams; Columbia, Puerto Rico, Brazil and Aruba; still waiting to confirm.Jakehas been playing baseball since he was 5 years old.Helives for baseball...whether he isreading books on players, watching plays on YouTube, or practicing with his dad and brother. Jake has played on travel teams in the US and Mexico. Hehas been blessed with a great travel team, Arizona Top Prospects (ATP), coached by Luis Tovar.Giving is a big part of the humanitarian and cultural aspect of the Latin American Baseball Classic experience. In conjunction with their corporate partners, players will take down bats, baseballs, equipment, donated clothing, school supplies and trinkets to give to the Latin players whom desperately need such items. This allows for the athletes to experience, firsthand, what it is like to have little in the aspects of things most of us take for granted in the USA.This truly is a \"once in a lifetime\" experience and with your help, Jakewill be able to represent Yuma and the United States and assist the team in bringing victory home to the USA!We are hoping to obtain gift donations from friends and family.

However my journey to Japan was cut short due to what is said to be the most shocking injury in American Ninja Warrior history. I cracked my femur, chipped my tibia, tore my ACL, MCL, lateral and medial meniscus; after surgery and several months of physical therapy I was back competing making it to stage 2 twice and taking the fastest time in my region. It has been 3 years since my injury and it is my hope to return to Japan and conquer the course that defeat me. My journey will begin in Malaysia, however due to a recent move it has made it difficult to save enough funds to travel. I will appreciate any amount donated and it would be my honor to represent America during my journey.'),\n",

LOVE N STUFF AUTUMN NEUGENTBeloved friend and renowned artistCarolyn Hall Young is now facingone of her biggest challenges to date with yet another serious recurrence of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, one of the three cancers she has battled over three decades. She justreturned to her home in New Mexico from the hospital whereher medical team worked hard to get her healthy enoughto undergo more rounds of a new generation of powerful chemotherapy. She will continue treatment from the comfort of her home base. We, Friends of Carolyn, want to mitigate some of the enormous expenses involved in her on-going care and treatment.For those who don\\'t know Carolyn Hall Young, here\\'s what\\'s essential about her:Our sweet, funny, kind, and gifted friend wakes up with compassion in her heart and generosity of spirit each and every daydespite the reality that shelives her precious and frail life in pain,tethered to oxygen, andbed-ridden. As her world has shrunk to the tiny confines of a bed, the digitaltoolsoffered by her trusty iPad with its innovative artistic apps have exponentially expanded her world to the size of the universe: infinite. And because Carolynlives in Art, she began each morningplanning whose portrait she wouldpaint that day tobestow, as a free, surprising, delightful gift, to friends, acquaintances, global colleagues, and virtual strangers. Forfive solid years, she posted1,620 iPad paintings to Facebook because of the joy it would give others and the joy it brought her. It became her mission and her way to keep flying through space ... with wings. So many of us have been on the receiving end of her art, her counsel, and her love: for that we are blessed. Now we can finally give back to her in a meaningful way while her husband Warren remains steadfastly at her side...which is exactly where he wantsto be. Please help us to help themby considering a donation of any size(noamountis consideredsmall) to defray a portionof her steadily mounting medical costs as well as home services, etc. All donations, minus the standard GoFundMe fees, will go directly to Carolyn and Warren.An inspiring,pioneering member of a global digital artists\\' community, Carolyn Hall Young is abeloved former classmate and friend. Mentor and teacher. She is passionate, brilliant,optomistic. Visionary,selfless, insightful. Wise beyond words. And deliciously, lushly whimsical! She has been described by friends and admirers all over the world like this:\"Life has dealt Carolyn challenges that most of us cannot imagine. And in the face of it all, she\\'s grown stronger, lighter, more grateful, and more in love, in the purest sense, with life and all of its wondrous gifts.\"\"Carolyn, I don\\'t believe you\\'ve ever been fully in this realm.

She has MANY people who love her dearly, and are all praying for her complete healing. Earlier this year Lora was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and we\\'ve all been amazed by her unbelievable courage as she takes on this fight! Recently Lora has began to prepare for the loss of her hair, and the cost of receiving a wig is simply outrageous during thisalready very trying time. This GoFund Me has been created to take a littlebit of the burden off of sweet Lora and her family by purchasing hera beautiful wig to help her feel more confident. We all know she is beyond stunning either way, but all women can understand the desire to look in the mirror and smile!! Thank you for supporting Lora in this fight, and we all know sheis going to beat this!!UPDATE:Wow!! You guys did an absolutely AMAZING job in helping to raise enough for Lora to get her gorgeous wig. In fact, within a of couple of days we even exceeded our goal. THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU!!! Her hair is SO beautiful, and she\\'s just as stunning as ever!! I know she really appreciates each and every one of you!!! What I\\'m about to suggest is something Lora hasn\\'t a clue about. It\\'s more than evident that her treatments are beyond exhausting, and she\\'s having to be gone from her family frequently. I\\'d like to re-open this GoFundMe page for Lora and her sweet family to have more opportunities to make amazing memories that will last a lifetime. Maybe they\\'ll decide to go on a dream vacation, or maybe it\\'ll help with the constant traveling that Lora is having to do to endure the treatments that she needs as she fights to beat this thing!! That\\'ll be to them!! They are such an incredible family, that we all love them very much!!!!Its that time of the year again, its Christmas! I know we all enjoy receiving gifts, but Tis the season of giving. As we sit around on Christmas Day, happily opening gifts with our families and loved ones, there are some children who wont have the same opportunity. Can you imagine as a child not enjoying the Christmas holiday, which is the most cheerful holiday of all? In a perfect world, every kid has the joy of opening gifts on Christmas Day, but the harsh reality is, not every kid will have that opportunity. Some of us may have experienced this same situation before, or know someone who has. With that memory in mind, help me make sure thats not the Christmas kids will have to experience. Any donation is appreciated and remember you are helping keep hope alive in the lives of the children. We cant help everyone but everybody can help someone\"-Regan \"He who is generous will be blessed, for he supplies the needy\".  Proverbs 22:9-Thank YouMy name is Michelle; I\\'m setting this up for my niece Payton. She is in ICU at the moment. Wednesday night when I spoke to my sister she said Payton had a fever. The next day Heidi noticed a bruise on Payton\\'s lower back and took Payton to the Hospital. They transported her to another hospital and admitted her into ICU where 20 people began working on Payton to saver her life. She had a very aggressive infection in her body that attacked her organs and showed its ugly face on her back. Payton was put on life support as they tried to stabilize her blood presser she was put on 4 different medications to keep her low blood pressure up. They took her to surgery to cut the infection out but it had already attacked her heart and other organs. They were not sure if she would survive the surgery. With lots of prayer she did survive. They cut out many inches of the infection on her back.On Friday they tried to stabilize her and would need to do another surgery to cut the dead skin off but they had to wait. Saturday morning they did the second surgery but this time came good news that the progression of the infection had not spread as much as they anticipated it would. There is damage to her heart which they continue to investigate how much and will be starting dialysis as soon as Payton is strong enough. Her white blood cells are low and that is concerning. They should be high considering the infection. There is a deeper issue the doctors are looking for. She will need white blood cells, bone marrow, a skin graph later on on. With all that is going on I do t want my sister to have to worry about money on top of it.Hello All...As many of you know, Nolan has been pretty sick as of lately, but maybe you don\\'t know either, because he hides it A LOT!....anyway, his spirit\\'s are down and he is feeling scared and a little overwhelmed with the constant set backs and decline in his health, As his mom I want nothing more then to just make it better somehow, someway ...I can\\'t produce the cure needed to save Nolan from this constant illness that hangs over him everyday, that causes him constant pain and I\\'m sure extreme anxiety about his loss of lung function ...So in racking my brain I thought I know I\\'ll send him to some places that he dreams of seeing, places that will distract him from his everyday life, places that will bring him joy and great memories..So I\\'m asking from a mother\\'s heart , if you can help in anyway to help me make his travel dreams a reality while he is still able I would be eternally grateful...thank youA little over a year ago, Scott was diagnosed with Mesothelioma. The doctors have tried everything they can to help Scott and this week the news was given to them that no one wants to hear. They told Scott and Jayme that there was nothing else they can do for Scott and that they give him a few months. This sweet family has a beautiful 10 year old daughter and a handsome little 4 year old son. Scott and Jayme are wonderful parents, and a true model to a marriage through rough times. They are praying that Scott\\'s pain level will decrease with new pain meds given to him and that they can make a few wishes come true. Disney being one of them. With Scott\\'s pain, a 9 hour car ride may be a little tough on him. It is our goal to raise enough money to fund them a trip to Disneywith flightsand be able to make amazing,lasting memories as a family. But most of all we ask for all of your prayers for the Davis familyas they continue to face what every family never wishes to face.Please share this and help us bless them.28-year-old Blake Hancock was diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.

We are taking 8 artists in a van from Vancouver \\nto New Orleans, telling tales of how queer and trans people of color and\\nTwo Spirit love, sex and desire is a force for healing and \\ntransformation. We are spinning life saving, world changing stories that\\npeople remember forever. We are going back to our roots: to where we \\nfirst began, when in 2007 we stuck 7 QTPOC performing artists in a 6-seater \\nminivan and took the Northeast by storm.\\nAnd we could use a little money. For things like \\naccessible hotel rooms and gas. For per diems and airfare and renting \\nvenues.  For making sure we are safe and have enough cash to take us \\nfrom unceded Coast Salish territories, otherwise known as Vancouver, to \\nNew Orleans, city of beautiful \\nresistance.  We\\'re proud that one of our co-directors and half our tour \\nperformers identify as disabled, and making sure we have wheelchair \\naccessible housing and that our venues are accessible comes from both \\nour overall commitment to disability justice and our responsibility to \\nensure that our tour is accessible to our performers. Booking both takes\\nsome cash. To give you a breakdown:$3,000 pays for van rental$1,500 pays for gas for the whole tour\\n$1,200 is the amount of plane tickets we put on a credit card and need to pay off$500 pays per diem for the cast and crew for two days$250 feeds the cast and crew for a day\\n$100 pays a tech person$50 is half of one hotel room$25 feeds one performer for one day$10 is three gallons of gas\\nAnd every single dollar helps.\\nWhy is this so important?

One pre-Kickstarter Paypal \\nfundraising campaign when we both literally had $47 in the bank. one \\npre-GPS 125 mile all night roadtrip through the backroads of northern \\nNew Mexico on no gas. One three hour ICE stop and search filled with \\nsexual and racial harassment, one 24 hour straight drive home from \\nDenver to Oakland through the Rockies, 20,000 donated hours, over 125 \\nvolunteers, and many many many memorable curtain calls to Prince\\'s \\n\"Let\\'s Go Crazy\\' later, we see how our labor has changed the world.Mangos With Chili is a North American touring, Bay Area \\nbased arts incubator committed to showcasing high quality performance of\\nlife saving importance by queer and trans artists of color to audiences\\nin the Bay Area and beyond. Our goal is to produce high-quality \\nmulti-genre performances reflecting the lives and stories of queer and \\ntrans people of color (QTPOC) and speaking out in resistance to the \\ndaily struggles around silence, isolation, homophobia and violence that \\nQTPOC face.Founded in 2006 by Cherry Galette and Leah \\nLakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, two trailblazing artists with significant \\nperformance experience and honors to their names. Mangos With Chili \\nbegan as an annual touring cabaret of queer and trans people of color \\nperformance artists, with the goal of creating a cultural institution \\nthat would build the careers and visibility of QTPOC artists. Our tours have performed to sold out houses across North America, \\nwowing audiences in world class theaters, underground performance \\nspaces, bars, and campus halls, with high intensity, breathtaking \\nperformance, politics, and storytelling craft, reflecting the lives and \\nstories of queer and trans people of color.  More than a performance incubator, we are also a ritual space for \\nqueer and trans communities of color to come together in love, \\nconversation and transformation. Our goal is to present high quality \\nperformance art by QTPOC, but so much of our work is also about creating\\nhealing and transformative space through performances that are \\ngathering places for QTPOC community.\\nWe\\'ve featured at  Brown  University, (feature for \\nthe Black Lavender Experience Theatre Symposium 2011), Oberlin, \\nSwathmore, Amherst, Smith, American University, Georgetown, \\nU.C. Berkeley, Mt. Holyoke, Humboldt State University, UT Austin. We are\\nequally proud of our performances in queer community centers, queer of \\ncolor bars, living rooms and Indigenous run infoshops. We\\'ve received \\npositive media coverage from the SF Bay Guardian, the SF Chronicle, The SF Appeal, Bitch, Feminist Review, Hip Mama, Aorta, and Make/Shift magazines,\\nand weeklies and alternative press across North America- and we\\'ve \\ngotten feedback like, \"Mangos with Chili is church\" from our audience \\nmembers.\\nWe started this work in 2006, inspired by second wave queer feminist \\nof color institutions like Kitchen Table Press that had given us life, \\nand had ended. 8 years later, we know so much more than we did about \\nboth what a struggle it is to sustain QTPOC arts institutions, and just \\nhow important it is.\\nThe 2014 Whipped Tour:\\nDuring late January and February 2014, we\\'ll take 8 artists on the road to tour Whipped: QTPOC Recipes for Love, Sex, and Disaster to\\naudiences along the West Coast, Southwest, and Gulf Coast.

Our mom & the strongest woman we know, Karen, is battling the early stages of Breast Cancer & stageIV Lung Cancer. It has made itself home throughout her body, but shes ready to put up the fight.The Mejia girls are no strangers to strength. In 2004 our Dad passed away, and it was then that we knew we had to be strong for each other. My mom did everything in her power to make sure that we were taken care of and were able to accomplish anything we wanted to, and continues to do so. Karen is a wonderful friend, daughter, sister and more, but her true calling was being our mother. She has always taken care of everyone in her life, and now its our turn to do the same for her. We will continue to stand strong together and embrace everyones love and support. This is going to be a struggle not only emotionally but financially as well. There will be many expenses that arise, and to take the stress off of my mom, we wanted to set this up for her. Karen works a full-time job, but will have to take a lot of time off to attend her treatments. Our youngest sister Kindel is still finishing up her last year in college, and so we will have to continue supporting her financially until the end. Unfortunately the medical bills, utility bills, and all other bills will continue to come.Thank you for thinking of Karen and our family. Please send prayers and well wishes for her as she begins her fight! Any donation big or small helps, and of course if you cannot, just keep her in your thoughts and prayers.[Donations are secure on this site and can even be made anonymously if you chose.]Thank you all for helping my Daddy\\'s final dream come true. We were given news that my dad, Tim Campana only has months left with us. His final dream and wish is to take a nice long family vacation. To spend every moment soaking up each memory together. My\\nParents are drowning in medical bills and with this news of my dad, my mom will be taking a leave of absence from work... Which means no pay check, but this wish means more then that to us... It means everything... Every little bit helps, thank you for your generosity and above all, your prayers. God is good, He will provide. \\nLove and prayers to you all.As most of you know I\\'m currently in the Navy and stationed just outside Oklahoma City. I have a son that lives in California. It will soon be his birthday (8 Nov) and he will be turning 10 years old. I joined the Navy a year ago and havent had a chance to take leave as of yet. I took some time off of work (before the Navy) to go see my dad back home in Korea. My dad is much older than most of your fathers, as he is 85. He was previously married before he met my mom and they had me. Anyway, some of you may know that my father\\'s health hasn\\'t exactly been the best, so before leaving for bootcamp I had to make the difficult choice of either seeing my father or my son. Being that I had just visited my son a few months prior, my father\\'s health, and not knowing when the Navy would allow me to visit Korea, a foreign country, again. I chose to visit my parents. Needless to say, it\\'s been about a year and a half since I have seen my son. I\\'ve never been the type to ask for help. I\\'m really prideful and don\\'t accept gifts or handouts. My father taught me to always work for what I want and you only deserve what you\\'ve earned. My father also taught me to be the first person to help someone in need. Regardless of what it is I\\'ve never been shy when it comes to lending a helping hand. Whether it\\'s money that a person needs, someone to talk to, advice, help with moving, just someone to be there for them--honestly, anything.. I\\'m the type of person to give the shirt off my back to help a friend or even a stranger. My offer to help, will always be open to anyone that knows me. It\\'s one of qualities my father instilled in me as a young child. Lately, I\\'ve been struggling myself. Let\\'s face it, I\\'m only an E-3 in the Navy and the military doesn\\'t pay us very well. I\\'ve managed pretty well for myself so far. My father\\'s been in the hospital since March and Tricare only covers up to a certain percentage of his hospital bill because he has to see a specialist at a civilian hospital. It\\'s not really fair that he\\'s in that type of situation when the military hospital is so limited. I help my parents out the best I can, I pay $600 a month in child support to help my son\\'s mother cover bills to raise him. I make sure he\\'s taken care of in all aspects. I\\'ve even gone as far as lending friend\\'s money to help them in need. All this is finally catching up to me. Unfortunately, I won\\'t be able to go to California to see my son for his birthday because the Navy won\\'t give me leave until December. Tickets are a bit more expensive during the holiday season as well. I would use any money raised from this fund to help cover my ticket, rental car, and hotel as I stay with my son for the 4 days of leave I get to take. Not only would this be unbelievably appreciated by myself, but it would make my son so incredibly happy. All he ever asks me whenever we FaceTime is when he will be able to see me again. You would make a little boy\\'s world and I will be forever greatful. Let me just say thank you in advance to those that can help and thank you to those that read this yet cannot help as well because I know not everyone has the ability to do so, but your prayers alone would be deeply appreciated. Thank youHello and thank you for taking a minute of your time to look at this page. My name is Tania and I have a small in-home daycare where I have met and been allowed to LOVE all of the children that spend their day with me as their caregiver on a daily basis. In July I received some news that one of my babies had something wrong with his eye and needed to go see a specialist. Of course the first thing I did was PRAY and ask my family and friends to PRAY that everything turned out ok. After the extensive testing was complete the results broke my heart. My little Alex was diagnosed with cancer in his eye and now needs to travel from Fredericksburg VA to the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia every other week for Chemo treatment... 209 miles away! This family has had to change their entire routine in order to get treatment for their baby. Mom can no longer work because she has to be home with Alex and tend to him on good and bad days. Dad is overworked and exhausted to be able to support not only financially but physically to be there every step of the way during these long drives and long sleepless nights. Alex has an older sister Giana and a twin brother Anthony who also have to make these trips in support of their brother. The expenses for this family have become unexplainably difficult to meet which is my reason for starting this fund. I really hope you can find it in your heart to contribute to this fund and help this family out. Every cent counts and is greatly appreciated. Even if you have taken the time to read this page and cannot contribute at this time, please leave a message of support and say a prayer for this family so they know their baby is being prayed for! Thank you in advance for your help and support! We love you Alexander Patton! Keep fighting Buddy!My brother-in-law, Greg Duits, has been diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a blood cancer that causes the plasma to become malignant. The cancer cells then accumulate in the bone marrow crowding out the healthy cells and compromising the integrity of the bone. An oncology treatment plan was quickly put into place. Greg is undergoing four rounds of chemo before heading to Ann Arbor for a stem cell transplant. This will include a 2-3 week hospital stay before returning home where he will heal and regain his strength over the course of three months. There is no cure for Multiple Myeloma but the intention of his treatments is to put the cancer into remission. Many people have asked me what they can do for Greg and Tricia. I\\'ve created this account just for that purpose. When you have cancer the everyday trials don\\'t just go away. The Duits family needs a new roof on their home. Greg and Tricia will both be missing weeks of work. They will be traveling to appointments in Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor. This means, gasoline, vehicle upkeep, food and hotels. While Greg is fighting, and winning, this battle I don\\'t want them to worry about a leaky roof, money, food or medical bills. I want them to feel a peace about those things. I want them to replace any worries, fears and concerns with love, strength, comfort and faith. Please consider donating any amount that you are able. Thank you for your generosity and kindness. I pray that you will be given an abundance of blessings in return.On Saturday October 29, 2016 I had the pleasure of winning the Seekonk Speedway DAV Memorial Late Model feature. It was at that exact moment, I knew I needed to help my long time friend, Leon Hayes by donating all my winnings to help my buddy out. He\\'ll probably be upset with me, but with his recent tragedies, I feel overly compelled to do this. Lee has always given the shirt off his back for anyone he ever met, now it\\'s his turn to accept a helping hand. Here is his story...The Hayes family has taken another hit in the wall of turn 3 in this race track called life. With the recent loss of the families \\'crew chief\\', Kristin Wordell Hayes, Lee, Haley, & Austin are now spinning tires in reverse trying to figure out how to get back into neutral let alone 1st gear.Lee & Kristin were married close to 16 years ago. They were blessed with 2 beautiful children, Haley & Austin. Life was normal for this crew of 4 until Austin was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Multiple surgeries & complications left this perfectly healthy school age child with numerous physical & cognitive deficits. Lee had no choice but to keep working full time in Local 17 sheet metal union & make race bodies on the side to help support his family so that Kristin could stay home & tend to the families needs. Kristin was the crew chief, the tire girl, the spotter, the fuel person, the garage sweeper. She was the dance mom, the house wife, the landscaper, and like many moms, carried the burdens in her heart for those in her family. Tragically on her 35th lap, Kristin left the race unexpectedly. She took the checkered flag and flew to a greater track in the sky. Her last lap was one the family will never forget. Now, her families cars are in track stalled & unable to get re-started. Lee now has to be the owner/driver, crew chief, tire guy, fuel guy, the spotter, the landscaper, & the dance dad, while carrying the hurt & pain of his children & grieve himself. Somewhere in this race, he needs to work to support his family, which has its very own unique set of circumstances. Haley still needs to be a teenager, Austin still needs ongoing attention, & Lee needs to be both the dad & the mom. Please help us support Leon Hayes in his race of life. This family has had enough cautions & red-flag moments interuppting the race. Let\\'s help them get the car back on the track so they can run the next 100 laps on one set of tires. Let\\'s help Lee take some time out of work so he can re-structure, re-organize, & re-do the set up & hopefully re-fire the engines to keep this race going.My amazing wife, Shannon, has been battling Multiple Sclerosis(MS) for a number of years, but has recently lost the ability to walk independently. For the past four weeks she has been limited to a wheelchair. We are currently in the process of changing her vehicle over to allow her to drive without using her feet. We are able to get most of this covered via grants provided by the state. We are also working on making home improvements that allow her to remain on the main floor of the house. It was our plan to have this funded via grants provided by the MS Society, but it is not going to happen for a number of reasons. The MS Society suggested that we create a GoFundMe campaign in order to collect donations to help with the home improvements. We are very blessed with all of the support that people have offered to help us during this rough patch. It is our understanding that this time of year is difficult for many families and we understand if people are unable to donate. If you are able to help it would be greatly appreciated by our entire family.My brother David has always been there for me, in good times and bad. Hes not only been there for me but hes always been there for his family, his temple and his community. He is a selfless person who has always given to others. Last January, he had a catastrophic ski accident, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down and necessitating the amputation of his leg. He has never asked Why me? or How could this have happened? He is truly an inspiration, and I am in awe of his strength. David has accepted his situation and has only looked forward, never back. In order for him to continue toward independence and to further his therapy, he needs medical equipment and a special vehicle that would allow him to drive on his own. Im asking you to help him reach these goals by making a contribution for him. Any amount will help, even $5 will make a difference. Living in Newtown Ct. David and his family know the importance of coming together and supporting one another when bad things happen. Please help us by making a contribution for David.Below is his story in his own words.After 50 years of downhillskiing,and 25 years of raising my kids to ski and snowboard, I lost control on some black ice and hit a tree at full speed. I dont remember the actual impact, just hitting the ice beforeand then laying on the slope after with a compound fracture of my right leg and a spinal cord injury. What followed has been an amazing journey through medical treatment, rehabilitation therapy and the support of an incredible family and community.The accident occurred on January 2, 2016. I spent the next two weeks in the intensive care unit at the UniversityofVermont Medical Center. The first week was spentreconstructing my leg and healingmy bruised ribs and organs so I could be rolled over for the back surgery. I had my back surgery the second week. The surgeon took some bone tissue from my hip to repair the damaged vertebra and then fusedvertebraT-4  T-11 together with titanium rods. The back and leg surgeries went well meaning that they at least stabilized my condition so that I could move on to the next stepwhich wasinpatient rehabilitation at the Kessler Institute in New Jersey.There I learned how to use a wheelchair, how to transfer to and from a bed, to and from a car, how to shower, how to dress and how to live as a paraplegic.One month after the accident, it became apparent that the woundon my leg from the compound fracture would not heal. The tissue and blood flow did not recover and it seemed to be facilitating an infection that was affecting the rest of my body. We decided to amputate above the knee.I know it sounds crazy but without that legdragging me down I was much more clear-headed and energetic.After two and half months of in patient rehabilitative therapy, I went home and the real work began. We had to adapt the front walk and stairs so I could get into the house and make some modifications to accommodate my wheelchair.As I got stronger and figured things out I became much more independent, my wife returned to work and I was able to be left alone during the day. My real freedom came though when an Eagle Scout candidate in town decided to build a permanent ramp to get me into my house from my front walk. Once that was completed I could get from inside my house down to my driveway and garage unassisted. I am determined to return to work full time or as close to it as possible. I recently completed training and am now certified to drive a car with hand controls. I would like to help David raise enough money so that he can buy a new van. If we are successful, and I believe with your help we can be, the state will pay for the conversion to add a ramp, hand controls and a modified drivers seat. The cost of such a vehicle, is between $40,000 - $50,000. In addition, David and Lynn need to make some additional modifications to their house so that he can get into and out of the shower easily, and so that he can reach appliances and the sink in the kitchen. These are small things that would allow him toward his independence. Finally, he is in need of some therapeutic equipment that is not covered by insurance. We are asking you, friends, family, and community members, to help David to be able to afford the things he needs for greater independence. Please give what you can. We thank you for your support.Nancy Wiener JoffeHi all first of all thank you for your time it means a lot to myself and Connors family.The reason for me starting to fundraise is that Connor will turn 21 in June and I\\'d love to be able to send him on a dream holiday. Connor was just 2 when his life changed, apart from a hole in his heart he was a healthy normal little boy. He was having operations to try and fix it. Sadly while Connor was being operated on he was starved of oxygen and was sadly left with complex medical needs that has sadly changed his life changed the path that was set out for him. He was never going to lead a normal straight forward life. connor has over come so many hurdles and i am so proud of him. All I\\'m going to say about him is he and his familyare my biggest inspiration the reason when am having a bad day I think hang on think about what others are going through, like you should do too! This young man never wants a thing just like his family but myself and others are trying with all our might to send Connor and his family on holiday. So please donate no matter how little it will all help :)\\n\\n\\n\\nFind us on Facebook search; Connor Ainsworth fundraising.\\n\\nThere are lots of costs that need to be taken into a account, oxygen, ventilator, insurance, meds, carer. All this has to be paid an organised even before looking for a holiday.Through out the months up until june i will be arranging events to raise vital funds to send connor on holiday, as to send him away will costs thousands of pounds so every penny or pound will come in helpful. he is an amazing inspiration and he and his family deserve this chance :) connor is ventilated an has a tracheostomy this is why a holiday will be so expensive and all vital medical equipment needs to be taken with him plus insurance which is through the roof but why should that stop them :)Let\\'s help a 56-year old Detroiter whowalks 21 miles a day to work - have a reliable and insured vehicle. Heartwarming story below.## STORY FROM DETROIT FREE PRESS (byBill Laitner) ##\\nHeart and sole: Detroiter walks 21 miles in work commuteHe doesn\\'t look athletic but James Robertson, 56, of Detroit has a champ\\'s commute. He rides buses part-way but walks about 21 miles in round trips to a factory, unless his banker pal offers a lift.Pudgy of form, shod in heavy work boots, Robertson trudges almost haltingly as he starts another workday.But as he steps out into the cold, Robertson, 56, is steeled for an Olympic-sized commute. Getting to and from his factory job 23 miles away in Rochester Hills, he\\'ll take a bus partway there and partway home. And he\\'ll also walk an astounding 21 miles.Five days a week. Monday through Friday.It\\'s the life Robertson has led for the last decade, ever since his 1988 Honda Accord quit on him.Every trip is an ordeal of mental and physical toughness for this soft-spoken man with a perfect attendance record at work. And every day is a tribute to how much he cares about his job, his boss and his coworkers. Robertson\\'s daunting walks and bus rides, in all kinds of weather, also reflect the challenges some metro Detroiters face in getting to work in a region of limited bus service, and where car ownership is priced beyond the reach of many.But you won\\'t hear Robertson complain  nor his boss.\\n\"I set our attendance standard by this man,\" says Todd Wilson, plant manager at Schain Mold & Engineering. \"I say, if this man can get here, walking all those miles through snow and rain, well I\\'ll tell you, I have people in Pontiac 10 minutes away and they say they can\\'t get here  bull!\"As he speaks of his loyal employee, Wilson leans over his desk for emphasis, in a sparse office with a view of the factory floor. Before starting his shift, Robertson stops by the office every day to talk sports, usually baseball. And during dinnertime each day, Wilson treats him to fine Southern cooking, compliments of the plant manager\\'s wife.\"Oh, yes, she takes care of James. And he\\'s a personal favorite of the owners because of his attendance record. He\\'s never missed. I\\'ve seen him come in here wringing wet,\" says Wilson, 53, of Metamora Township.With a full-time job and marathon commutes, Robertson is clearly sleep deprived, but powers himself by downing 2-liter bottles of Mountain Dew and cans of Coke.\"I sleep a lot on the weekend, yes I do,\" he says, sounding a little amazed at his schedule. He also catches zzz\\'s on his bus rides. Whatever it takes to get to his job, Robertson does it.\"I can\\'t imagine not working,\" he says.\\'Lord, keep me safe\\'The sheer time and effort of getting to work has ruled Robertson\\'s life for more than a decade, ever since his car broke down. He didn\\'t replace it because, he says, \"I haven\\'t had a chance to save for it.\" His job pays $10.55 an hour, well above Michigan\\'s minimum wage of $8.15 an hour but not enough for him to buy, maintain and insure a car in Detroit.As hard as Robertson\\'s morning commute is, the trip home is even harder.At the end of his 2-10 p.m. shift as an injection molder at Schain Mold\\'s squeaky-clean factory just south of M-59, and when his coworkers are climbing into their cars, Robertson sets off, on foot  in the dark  for the 23-mile trip to his home off Woodward near Holbrook. None of his coworkers lives anywhere near him, so catching a ride almost never happens.Instead, he reverses the 7-mile walk he took earlier that day, a stretch between the factory and a bus stop behind Troy\\'s Somerset Collection shopping mall.\"I keep a rhythm in my head,\" he says of his seemingly mechanical-like pace to the mall.At Somerset, he catches the last SMART bus of the day, just before 1 a.m. He rides it into Detroit as far it goes, getting off at the State Fairgrounds on Woodward, just south of 8 Mile. By that time, the last inbound Woodward bus has left. So Robertson foots it the rest of the way  about 5 miles  in the cold or rain or the mild summer nights, to the home he shares with his girlfriend.\"I have to go through Highland Park, and you never know what you\\'re going to run into,\" Robertson says. \"It\\'s pretty dangerous. Really, it is (dangerous) from 8 Mile on down. They\\'re not the type of people you want to run into.\"But I\\'ve never had any trouble,\" he says. Actually, he did get mugged several years ago  \"some punks tuned him up pretty good,\" says Wilson, the plant manager. Robertson chooses not to talk about that.So, what gets him past dangerous streets, and through the cold and gloom of night and winter winds?\"One word  faith,\" Robertson says. \"I\\'m not saying I\\'m a member of some church. But just before I get home, every night, I say, \\'Lord, keep me safe.\\'\"The next day, Robertson adds, \"I should\\'ve told you there\\'s another thing: determination.\"A land of no busesRobertson\\'s 23-mile commute from home takes four hours. It\\'s so time-consuming because he must traverse the no-bus land of rolling Rochester Hills. It\\'s one of scores of tri-county communities (nearly 40 in Oakland County alone) where voters opted not to pay the SMART transit millage. So it has no fixed-route bus service.Once he gets to Troy and Detroit, Robertson is back in bus country. But even there, the bus schedules are thin in a region that is relentlessly auto-centric.\"The last five years been really tough because the buses cut back,\" Robertson says. Both SMART and DDOT have curtailed service over the last half decade, \"and with SMART, it really affected service into Detroit,\" said Megan Owens, executive director of Transportation Riders United.Detroit\\'s director of transportation said there is a service Robertson may be able to use that\\'s designed to help low-income workers. Job Access and Reverse Commute, paid for in part with federal dollars, provides door-to-door transportation to low-income workers, but at a cost. Robertson said he was not aware of the program.Still, metro Detroit\\'s lack of accessible mass transit hasn\\'t stopped Robertson from hoofing it along sidewalks  often snow-covered  to get to a job.At home at workRobertson is proud of all the miles he covers each day. But it\\'s taking a toll, and he\\'s not getting any younger.\"He comes in here looking real tired  his legs, his knees,\" says coworker Janet Vallardo, 59, of Auburn Hills.But there\\'s a lot more than a paycheck luring him to make his weekday treks. Robertson looks forward to being around his coworkers, saying, \"We\\'re like a family.\" He also looks forward to the homemade dinners the plant manager\\'s wife whips up for him each day.\"I look at her food, I always say, \\'Excellent. No, not excellent. Phenomenal,\\'\" he says, with Wilson sitting across from him, nodding and smiling with affirmation.Although Robertson eats in a factory lunchroom, his menus sound like something from a Southern caf: Turnip greens with smoked pork neck bones, black-eyed peas and carrots in a brown sugar glaze, baby-back ribs, cornbread made from scratch, pinto beans, fried taters, cheesy biscuits. They\\'re the kind of meal that can fuel his daunting commutes back home.Though his job is clearly part of his social life, when it\\'s time to work this graduate of Northern High School is methodical. He runs an injection-molding machine the size of a small garage, carefully slicing and drilling away waste after removing each finished part, and noting his production in detail on a clipboard.Strangers crossing pathsRobertson has walked the walk so often that drivers wonder: Whoisthat guy? UBS banker Blake Pollock, 47, of Rochester, wondered. About a year ago, he found out.Pollock tools up and down Crooks each day in his shiny black 2014 Chrysler 300.\"I saw him so many times, climbing through snow banks. I saw him at all different places on Crooks,\" Pollock recalls.Last year, Pollock had just parked at his office space in Troy as Robertson passed. The banker in a suit couldn\\'t keep from asking the factory guy in sweats, what the heck are you doing, walking out here every day? They talked a bit. Robertson walked off and Pollock ruminated.From then on, Pollock began watching for the factory guy. At first, he\\'d pick him up occasionally, when he could swing the time. But the generosity became more frequent as winter swept in. Lately, it\\'s several times a week, especially when metro Detroit sees single-digit temperatures and windchills.\"Knowing what I know, I can\\'t drive past him now. I\\'m in my car with the heat blasting and even then my feet are cold,\" Pollock says.Other times, it\\'s 10:30 or 11 p.m., even after midnight, when Pollock, who is divorced, is sitting at home alone or rolling home from a night out, and wondering how the man he knows only as \"James\" is doing in the frigid darkness.On those nights, Pollock runs Robertson all the way to his house in Detroit.\"I asked him, why don\\'t you move closer\" to work. \"He said his girlfriend inherited their house so it\\'s easy to stay there,\" Pollock said.On a recent night run, Pollock got his passenger home at 11 p.m. They sat together in the car for a minute, outside Robertson\\'s house.\"So, normally you\\'d be getting here at 4 o\\'clock (in the morning), right?\" the banker asks. \"Yeah,\" Robertson replies. Pollock flashes a wry smile. \"So, you\\'re pretty early, aren\\'t you?\" he says. Robertson catches the drift.\"Oh, I\\'m grateful for the time, believe me,\" Robertson says, then adds in a voice rising with anticipation: \"I\\'m going to take me a bath!\"After the door shuts and Pollock pulls away, he admits that Robertson mystifies him, yet leaves him stunned with admiration for the man\\'s uncanny work ethic and determination.\"I always say to my friends, I\\'m not a nice guy. But I find myself helping James,\" Pollock says with a sheepish laugh. He said he\\'s picked up Robertson several dozen times this winter alone.Has a routineAt the plant, coworkers feel odd seeing one of their team numbers always walking, says Charlie Hollis, 63, of Pontiac. \"I keep telling him to get him a nice little car,\" says Hollis, also a machine operator.Echoes the plant manager Wilson, \"We are very much trying to get James a vehicle.\" But Robertson has a routine now, and he seems to like it, his coworkers say.\"If I can get away, I\\'ll pick him up. But James won\\'t get in just anybody\\'s car. He likes his independence,\" Wilson says.Robertson has simple words for why he is what he is, and does what he does. He speaks with pride of his parents, including his father\\'s military service.\"I just get it from my family. It\\'s a lot of walking, I know.\"I started baking beside my dad many moons ago and it has been a favorite pastime ever since. Just over a year ago, I took a sabbatical from the daily grind and did an internship with my little sister. Yes, I learned something (lots) from her, a baker and cake decorator extraordinaire! When I returned to the east coast, I startedSweetly Brooklyn , a small batch bakery, inspired by life and Brooklyn. There\\'s a lot to be inspired by in this city (and life), so there have been lots of baking to do!Recently, I\\'ve been given the sweet opportunity to partner with a bakery in Long Island City, Queens (or \"LIC\" as the locals call it) and to have a brick and mortar shop, one of my life\\'s dreams! Partnering in a business does entail a significant amount of committment, so I am looking for donations to help make this dream possible and to help fill another borough in this concrete jungle with some sweetness. How you can help? Donate in any denomination. I have a big goal to reach and every bit helps! I will have lots of people to thank along the way and would like to add you to the list, if you\\'re not already on it. And if do you donate, there are some really sweet incentives!

This violin will enable me to reacha higher level on my instrument,necessary to start my Doctoral Degree.My current violin, while it has taken me this far, has reached a sound threshold. It\\'s incapability is holding me back from reaching a higher level of playing, necessary to support the next step in my professional career. \\n\\nI come from a humble family and had it not been for the generous scholarships and support that I have been blessed with, there would have been no other way to take my art as far as I have. As an international student, I cannot legally work in the country, nor take out loans. I have been working hard to keep my dream alive, but the lack of a good instrument has created many obstacles in my journey.\\n\\nAn instrument is much more than a tool, but rather a sophisticated relationship that both challenges and inspires. I have had the priviledge to prepare and perform several concerts over the last three months an 1878 Collin-Mezin, a french violin, and my time with this instrument has been nothing short of enriching. My musical imagination has reaped the wonderful benefits of practicing on this instrument and in many ways I have regained a feeling of hope and confidence in my artistic self-expression.Unfortunately, I am in a predicament where if I cannot raise the money by the end of Julyto pay for this violin I have to return it.\\n\\nAs a violinist, my sound and my musical voice, not only depends on my talent but also upon the instrument I use. I created a very strong connection with the Collin Mezin, and my feelingshearing the sounds I produce with this violin are indescribable. I\\'m sure that if I have to return this instrument part of my musical voice is going to be silenced.\\n\\nThe cost of a professional violin varies on a wide spectrum and to find one of this quality at such a price is a challenge. I have played many instruments that have cost more than 10 times but did not speak as well in my hands. I am fortunate I found an instrument worth the fight. \\n\\nMusic changed my life, and I have hopes of being able to change the lives of many for the better through the violin.\\n\\nIt\\'s my dreamto further my education as a doctoral student and to sow all the benefits of learning an instrument with society by contributing to the whole community, sharing music and my love for the instrument. In order to keep these dreams alive I really need a suitable violin. \\n\\nYou can be part of this story! Please help me keep the Collin Mezin! Any contribution will help me in realizing this dream.Alone we can do so little, together we can do the impossible!\\n\\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nHow did you find it? \\n\\nI first came across this instrument at the 2014 American String Teachers Association Convention hosted in Louisville, KY. I had been in the market for professional violin for the last three years but had neither the expenses nor the right encounter with an instrument that I could commit to. With, quite literally, minutes left in the convention I ran over to a table in the vender exposition to try one last instrument. The experience was nothing less than love at first sight!\\n\\n Why this violin? \\n\\nMusic making is a combustion of elements and not all instruments have the same chemical reaction in the hands of other players. This instrument responds to my touch and I realize a higher musical self when I play on it. This violin has a naturally rich and round timbre that projects effortlessly. The higher register remains sweet and present without becoming overly bright. The physical dimensions of the instrument are like a puzzle piece that intertwines with my hands and I feel very comfortable playing this violin. The cost of a professional violin varies on a wide spectrum and to find one of this quality at such a price is a challenge. I have played many instruments that have cost more than triple but did not speak as well in my hands.\\n\\n How much does the violin cost?\\n\\nThe violin costs $15,000 dollars. In order to raise this amount of money, I have to raise $17,000 to compensate for the 12% fee Gofundme.com will charge me from all the money donated.\\n\\n Why is this violin so expensive?\\n\\nAs odd as it might sound, this violin is inexpensive when compared to other old professional violins. The price range of this kind of instrument varies between $15K, all the way to millions of dollars. Thats right, millions.Not all instruments are created equally, and most violins are expensive today mainly due to the high workmanship skills possessed by the famous violin makers, like Stradivari, Guarneri, or Collin-Mezin, who produced violins that are one-of-a-kind. The quality of the materials used to make the antique violins does determine the price of the violins too. If you do an online search of expensiveviolins, you will notice that the famous Stradivarius violins were made in the period between 1700 and 1725. Many termed this Stradivari\\'s \\'golden period\\'. Numerous experts discussed that the violins made during that period were considered the best due to the presence of a special quality of wood, which only existed during that period. Other than the wood used during the golden period of Stradivari, other top quality woods were used for many other antique violins, and which also determine the sound and tone quality produced by them. Generally, the slower growing and higher altitude varieties of wood have more clarity and depth, a better balance of sound. Of course, these select tone-woods are more rare, and thus more expensive. The price of the violin, besides the quality of materials and the quality of workmanship, are also estimated accordingly to the way the violin sounds. People use descriptive terms such as Sweet, Dry, Warm, Bright, Clear, and Muddy as some of the descriptions of sound produced. A Bright violin may be a little harsh under the ear, but carry very well and be easy to hear when playing with other musicians. A Warm violin may be satisfying to play solo, a clear violin might be good for playing in an ensemble. Yet another reason is the Supply and Demand. There are few old violins that survived history, and they are no longer being made. Simple economics dictates that, when there is a demand but little supply, value increases. Another thing to consider is that violins are also a piece of art. Violin Makers can certainly be compared to painters, sculptures, and other artists, while the Mona Lisa can be easily compared to one of the top Stradivari violins. The historic value of these instruments also contributes for the total estimated price of the violins. While the violin itself can cost millions, there are violin bows that command tens of thousands of dollars too.\\n\\nWhy can the Guri Project not help you buy the violin? \\n\\nThe incarnation of the Guri Project that gave me my passion for the violin and funded my undergraduate education and artist diploma no longer exists in the same capacity. Today the program is known as Reference Groups (Grupos de Referncia) where exemplarily students receive a small monthly scholarship towards their studies. The budget of the current project is based on private donations and government funding, and in my case, the project could not validate partitioning their resources to this instrument.\\n\\n Why can you not work during summer time to raise the money? What about loans?\\n\\nAs an international student I am not allowed to legally work in the country nor take out student loans. Under these conditions, private loans are also challenging to acquire as I have already made several attempts.Why investing on me? I believe I have a truly unique story that does not mold to the young child receiving private lessons under the watchful eye of their parents. While in Brazil there were many struggles to keep music in my life. I have carried my personal work ethic with me to over a dozen countries, where if I worked hard, ends would meet. I often feel a pressure against time, where many of my peers have been performing on professional instruments for as long as I have been studying the violin. I envision great things for my career, it is my dream to be among the highest level of violin performers, performing as a solo recitalist and delivering my music to as many people as I can reach through recordings and live performances. I also plan to sow all the benefits of learning an instrument with society by contributing to the whole community, sharing music and my love for the instrument.\\n\\nWhy is your old violin not good enough?\\n\\nI currently own a copy of a Jacob Stainer, which I purchased in Bulgaria with the help of the Guri Project. The violin served me well for the beggining of my undergraduate education. Unfortunately, the violins limitations began to impede my technical and musical progress by the end of my Bachelors degree. For the entire duration of my artists diploma, I performed on a violin graciously loaned by my former teacher, Andres Cardenes. When I arrived in Louisville, I had to leave my teachers violin in Pittsburgh. While pursing my Masters, the limitations of my own instrument became more obvious. Some of the challenges include a lack of projection, wolf pitches on the G string, a lack of clarity in the higher register, and a lack of balance between the 4 strings. I was delighted that all of these challenges were not present when I first played the Collin-Mezzin. Would small donations like $5 still help? Yes! Every little bit helps!\\n\\n Why do you have 2 websites?\\n\\nMost simply, the Brazilian website (kickante) that I am also using was set up to help facilitate the donation process with the conversion of currency. Also, the Kickante campaign does not require a credit card in order to make donations which allows the campaign to reach a wider audience.\\n\\nWhen can I expect my rewards?\\n\\nYou can expect your rewards no later than a month of your donation. The only exceptions apply to the CD project and Composer Collaboration Rewards.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis video was made with the contribution of the Guri Project, So Paulo - Brazil. Special thanks to Michael Kagan, Helen Valadares, Alessandra Costa,Isabela Fernandes, Vinicius Nakamura, Tim Hutchens, and many friends for helping me put this campaign together.This is my twinsy Raul Pizarro and my name is Holly. We may not look alike, we are not the same age and we are not related but our birthdays are on the same day and our love for each other is immense and thats enough to make us twins. Raul is a very talented artist who creates some amazing works of art despite his physical limitations. He was born with muscular dystrophy and he wasnt expected to live past 14 years old. Hes now 40 and that is a miracle in itself. Muscular Dystrophy is a progressive wasting of his muscles, each year he loses more muscle and more independence. He has known a life where he could walk to the one now where hes confined to the abilities of his wheelchair instead of the abilities of his body. He relies on the grace of other people, not just for experiencing life, but to get to doctors appointments and to assist him in being able to continue with the thing he loves mosthis art. People with big hearts build his canvases, take him to buy supplies, and assist with everything involved in his shows or events. He can no longer drive his own truck and is very much in need of a wheelchair accessible van. Leaving the house is limited to friends and family with the ability to still lift him into his little Toyota pick-up truck because his motorized chair needs to go where he goes. Currently, you have to unfold a heavy rickety ramp and line it up on the back of the flatbed and cautiously get a 250lb chair up it without it veering off the narrow ramp. Being able to go out also depends on the weather, transporting his chair this way risks his chair getting rained on and damaged. This van would change his life and give him some freedom and a little independence that everyone deserves. Muscular Dystrophy has stolen things from him over the years that we all take for granted and yet he remains such a beautiful and inspirational soul. You know your life is better just for having him in it. Lets give him something back. Lets give him the simple ability to put himself in and out of the car and not be limited to where he can go and what he can do based on if someone is around to do it for him. Lets shine the same light in his world that he adds to ours. He should be a world renowned artist with money out his wazoo because his talent is endless but he is notYET! So I\\'m asking for the help of many hands. If you can spare $5, $10, $20 or more, please consider helping him because he deserves a heart as happy as he makes ours. This means the world to me, I would appreciate any help youre able to give. And if you dont know him, feel free to check out any of his websites and let something he created or said make you smile. www.facebook.com/raul.pizarroRaul Pizarro\\'s Art Facebook page  www.facebook.com/LifeSaysYes www.lifesaysyes.com RaulPizarro.com - OFFICIAL ART PAGE http://brokeassstuart.com/blog/2016/01/28/91307/ http://www.raulsarmsrace.com/Whether you are able to donate or not, check out his  www.lifesaysyes.com pageand let him give something to you. Raul and a friend set out to \"inspire some folks to be a little more courageous and fearless when it comes to doing something that youve always wanted to do but just didnt know if you had it in you.\"Sean and Shon are already happy newlyweds and have many dreams waiting to come true! Now begins the very lengthy and staggeringly expensive task of consulting with lawyers,filing out forms in both countries and travel for immigration interviews so that Sean can join Shon in America as a working resident and citizen.  We are hoping to generate enough compassionate interest to make this process happen as smoothly and quickly as possible so that the love and joy we share can continue to grow. Please, consider a gift that would help two people who love each other immensely be together, our gratitude will be never-ending and we\\'ll always count our blessings because of it!Thank you for your considerations, with gratitude and love,   Sean and ShonMy name is Thea. I am 49 years old and my Higher Power/God put the love of my life across my path one and a half years ago (yes  it is NEVER too late for this kind of miracle to happen). His name is Christopher. He is 66 yrs old, a proud Marine Vietnam veteran who has devoted his life to be in service to others, especially recovering alcoholics. He is a champion of womens rights and personal empowerment.Christopher is a loyal, honest and devoted partner who has healed and elevated me through our relationship. Through Chriss healing love, within months of our first date, God\\'s gift of true love was apparent as well as a free energy that enabled us to move easily through transition as we quickly merged our lives together. His comment to all the chaos of newly merging two households under one roof Honey, I welcome this clutter because it means that you are with me. Yes, this is the kind of man he is. Eight months from our first date, Christopher was rushed to the ER due to critically low-sodium and released 8 days later. After a stint in the ICU, he emerged with a lethal diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer. The average life expectancy from time of diagnosis is 6  12 months. On our first date, Christopher spoke of an unfulfilled dream that hes had deep in his heart since he was 5 yrs old  to wander the hills and valleys of Ireland. I knew at that moment, among other things, I was put in Christophers life to help him manifest this lifelong dream. We married four months after the cancer diagnosis. Though both of us were married and divorced before, the gravity of our love drew us together inevitably despite the grave prognosis we are now both facing (Chriss cancer has metastasized since the initial diagnosis). We got married last November at a friends cottage walking hand in hand to the Beatles All You Need Is Love because we discovered through our journey and by the grace of Gods love, that loveis truly all we need. So, we are appealing to the greater, global love of humanity. We recognize that we all have dreams and loves. Christophers cancer and the complications of this diagnosis forced him to quit work which cut our income significantly. We do not have the financial means on our own to fund Christophers dream and time is of the essence - for all of us really.We thank you for taking the time to read our story  one of many beautiful stories of love. If you feel moved to help us manifest Christophers dream, bless you and thank you. If you feel moved to say a prayer or send Christopher healing light and energy, bless you and thank you. If you read this and do none of the above, bless you and thank you for your time. Life is precious. Namaste.This is Kaylee Michelle. She is a bright, sweet, brave, Jesus loving 5 year old that was diagnosed with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma, or RMS for short, over 2 years ago this October. While Kaylee has been very strong during all of her treatments and operations, this sickness has taken a financial toll on her family. With a little brother at home, trips back and forth to the hospital for chemo and other treatments, mom has become the 24 hour caregiver and dad the sole provider. Along with medical bills there are a whole lot of hidden costs that come along with a serious illness. There are parking fees, gas for trips to the hospital, special foods and shakes to keep herplatelet count up and list just goes on.  If you feel lead to help this family we would greatly appreciate it. No amount is to big or to small. Every dollar counts for this family. If you are unable to donate cash but still would like to help with gas or grocery gift cards please contact Kaylee\\'s aunt Johanny via Facebook.As you may know, Im leaving my lifelong passion of theatre to pursue another passion full-time: cooking. (Read about it here.) I will be moving to Louisiana to help my wonderful #masterfriend Chef Jesse Romero open his spot, Robear Ln. , which will be featured in White Star Market in Mid-City BR. Its literally being built as I type this, which is incredibly dope.Why are you moving so early, if the building doesnt even exist yet, Casey? you might be asking. In the interim, Ill be working with Chef at Jax Brewhouse in the French Quarter in New Orleans, while White Star Market is under construction. There, I will be building my working relationship with both a new executive chef, the rest of the kitchen staff, and an entirely new cuisine (to me): Cajun (and more specifically, Acadian).If you know me, I hate asking for help. Its actually the main source of my lifelong battle with anxiety. I hate feeling helpless or like I cant do things on my own. I rarely ask for it, but dispensing it freely has been one of the greatest gifts of my life. The irony is not lost on me. To be completely honest with you, this is probably one of the most mortifying things I could be doing.Also, if you know me, I am chronically early. My motto is early is on time / on time is late / and late means youre fired (many of you have heard me say this; some about you). For me, its all about being prepared, physically and mentally. My original contract date was set for January 6, but my move date is December 28th, as I am trying to jump in early and get started.Im starting this GoFundMe to well, help get me to work on time. Basically, easing my anxieties. When I was approached about this opportunity, I was excited to take it, but also knew I had zero money to move. After having lived in the Bay Area on my own for the past three years, I have nothing to show for it, savings-wise, because, as many of you know, it is incredibly hard to do here.Things I need to pay for:- my first months rent + security deposit for a sublet (which Im still looking for, but Im setting my budget at $1000 max, for rent)- - my one-way ticket to NOLAshipping the very few, large items to LA (my bed, artwork, most of my clothes, etc)It is a lot of money that Im asking for. Im putting away as much as I can and trying to sell the few things of value that I own, in addition to reducing the amount of stuff I have, in order to make this as affordable as possible.Lets put it this way: I have a job when I get there. Given six weeks to move, with rent and bills here still to pay, I wouldnt be able to save enough in time to set myself up for my next chapter.I know that the holidays are upon us and money is generally tight around this time. I am gratefulfor any and all amounts thrown my way. I won\\'t be able to do this without y\\'all.Help me get to work. Please?#GeauxFundMe #BayToBayouThis GoFundMe account is setup to request donations for the purpose of raising enough money to purchase a reliable vehicle to transport Carl Cole to school and appointments. The vehicle that was being used, a 2001 Chevy Venture extended minivan with almost 300,000 miles, has an engine problem which makes it impractical to fix. A borrowed vehicle is currently being used.Leona Simon is the full time caregiver to her grandson Carl Cole. Carl currently attends Freedom Acres School, located southwest of Ionia Michigan, five days a week. Students attending school may interact with a variety of staff including Teachers, Health Care Aides, Speech Therapists, Occupational Therapists and Physical Therapists. Special education programs are operated in accordance with Michigans Revised Administrative Rules for Special Education. Leona provides transportation to and from school and usually stays around the Ionia area until dismissal at 2:15 to avoid an extra trip.Carl was born on September 22nd 2010 at Ingham Medical Center after a normal length pregnancy. Carl was unable to continue independent cardiopulmonary functions within 12 hours of being born and was placed on an ECMO machine at U of M Mott Childrens Hospital. (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation, meaning heart-lung bypass). Carl had many complications arise during his treatment at the U of M Mott Childrens Hospital but was eventually discharged on December 6, 2010.Carl has had multiple medical challenges in his short life. Although Carl has made great progress there are still existing conditions which require various medical professionals to be actively involved. Those conditions producing the most concern are Adrenal insufficiency, GK (Glycerol Kinase Deficiency) and DMD (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy). In addition to these genetic disorders, Carl has a curved spine and only one fully functional lung and kidney. Carl is taking various medications, his weight is below average for his age, and he also has delayed development primarily due to his medical conditions. Despite having all the hardships to contend with Carl has an outgoing personality and a very positive, determined character.Due to Carls medical conditions, he requires appointments with various medical professionals. These include periodic appointments to U of M Mott Childrens Hospital, Joel Greenburg, his pediatrician, and Sparrow Hospital to obtain blood test results. In addition to this, Carl has periodic physical and speech therapy appointments at Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids. Carl also participates in a program which allows Grand Valley State physical therapy students to become familiar with his medical history and spend time with him in therapy sessions, a mutually beneficial arrangement. Carl and Leona have also participated in the Sparrow Hospital Children\\'s Miracle Network Telethon for the past two years and been interviewed as part of their broadcasts.As many of you may or may not know, our friend and colleague Ken Steiner has recently been hospitalized and is facing major surgery and mounting medical expenses. Always ready to lend a hand, he has given many hours of his time volunteering for Little Brothers, cooking wonderful meals for the senior citizens in this area. He has graced our music circles with his voice and harmonica and shared good times and hard times with his Copper Country friends and family.

Thank you so much for whatever you can do. Ken will appreciate it.Tony Adams is such a blessing to sports parents in the area. We wanted to set up this page, to say \"Thank You\" and give something back to Tony for all he does. He spends his evenings and weekends traveling along side our teams, and capturing memories of our kids.  Typically at sporting events the photographers charge per picture, Tony posts them online for parents.  He takes on a lot of expense in order to do these things.

Please share this on FB!Thank you!Hello GoFundMe ----- On August 11, 1997 I fell asleep at the wheel. My car rolled off the side of the road and down a hill. Due to multiple surgeries, anesthesia and pain medicine, my first memories were roughly 2 weeks after the crash. I was told I have an 80% contusion of the L1 vertebrae, paralysis. I was a paraplegic, in other words, bound to a wheelchair. Despite this tragic event I was back at work that November( \\'97 ) part time. 1.5 years before my crash I had started working for a family owned technical recruiting company called ICC Corp, in Petaluma, CA. I really enjoyed technical recruiting and they were very supportive during my recovery....helping me every step of my rehab. Unfortunately after the original owner sold the company, an auto parts company took over. The company disintegrated quickly and ceased to exist by 2003 due to a recession and a parent company called MSXI that didnt know staffing. I took another job in 2004 with a very large staffing company in the Silicon Valley. I will refer to them as X company. I learned a lot at company X. I really enjoyed my time there but around 2012 things changed. The CEO \"resigned\". Our 25 year long NorCal VP was let go. The company was suspended from the NYSE due to discrepencies in our financial records. After that ANYONE/everyone senior level was being fired or laid off. I was let go in September 2013. I found out the company was losing a LOT of money. Everyone senior level like myself was let go and replaced by a college graduate at half the price. I started looking for work and landed a permanent job with CHR in San Jose. I learned very quickly it was a horrible match for me. The recruiting manager was a hardware engineer and had never recruited. The commute from Alameda( where I moved after 10 years in San Jose ) to San Jose was 3-4 hours round trip. I didnt like anything about that job. At the end of May 2014 I was terminated. I would have quit, but I really needed the unemployment money. So I started looking for work again. I worked 4 different contract jobs and none that I wished became permanent. About the time I took my 2nd contract job, I contracted a bad urinary tract infection/UTI. This caused me to miss work quite a bit and in contracting you really cannot have any sick days. In the last 36-37 months I have been unemployed for 18 months. Not only did I have this illness but my age and wheelchair were a fairly big disadvantage in finding work. Two of my contract roles were just 1 phone interview, no on-site interviews. And when I rolled into those 2 jobs in my wheelchair, the disappointment was palpable. The other part of this story is starting in 2013, I was going through a divorce. I had to pay my lawyer a retainer fee of $3,500 and also $500 a month. And until we went before a judge which took 18 months, I was paying my ex wife $925 a month for child support. My healthcare has been Obamacare and I was paying $600 a month for healthcare and coming out of pocket for all prescriptions and doctor appts. I am 45k in debt due to divorce, REALLY bad healthcare, 18 months of unemployment and a urinary tract infection that has lingered for nearly 2 years. My car has 165k miles but given my debt, I cannot afford to buy a better car. My car in the past few years has needed a new transmission, a new starter, 2 new radiators, radiator hoses/fan, 2 oxidizers in the exhaust, a fuel pump and it started over heating last week. It now needs a new water pump which costs $600.00 which I dont have. Ideally I would buy a new( used but newer than mine ) but I have not worked since March 11th, 2016. I actually had a job offer at a company called Intelligent Staffing. My start date was Tuesday, 10/4/2016. The Monday morning before my orientation day, start day, my car would not start. I called a mobile mechanic. He came to my girlfriends house and replaced the fuel pump but the car still would not start. This mechanic started at 11:30am and worked until 3pm. He told me he would come back the next day to check my fuel line. I called I.S. explained to the owner that my car broke down that morning and its still not running so I would miss my orientation but I would call into the 10am meeting to listen to orientation and introduce myself. He seemed OK when we hung up. Feeling stressed out, I decided to stroll/roll up to Safeway and get some fresh air. When I was coming out of the grocery store I pulled my phone out to text my girlfriend. I noticed I missed a call/voicemail. Likely because my phone was muzzeled by my sweatshirt in my shoulder bag. It was the I.S. owner leaving a message @ 5:15pm. He said \"I talked with our COO, and we decided we are going to rescind your offer\". So the ONLY JOB OFFER I have had in the last 7 months was lost due to this bucket of bolts crappy car I have. I felt blindsided. But that car is NOT RELIABLE and unfortunately these people somehow knew my car was a wreck. Its not worth even $1,000 dollars. The WORST PART is, this is my weekend with my twin girls, age 6. But given my car now needs a water pump, I wont be seeing my girls this weekend......AT ALL. I split time between my moms home im Fairfax, CA & my girlfriends house in San Leandro, CA. If not for their generosity, I would be homeless right now. And without a running car, I have no idea if I can accept a new job offer unless its next to the BART train. I am stuck at my girlfriends house and I dont know when I will be able to go anywhere. Missing time with my kids is the worst part. They are just 6 years old and I have missed a LOT OF TIME with them due to my car trouble. I need to work and I need a car so I dont lose anymore. job offers. I wont have any kind of life with NO VEHICLE. I WOULD BE VERY, VERY, VERY GRATEFUL for a reliable vehicle. I pray to God my life will change soon. My wheelchair, chronic nerve pain and my age( 50 ) are big enough obstacles to over come. No car is an obstacle I cannot overcome. I implore anyone out there for help so I can buy a reliable vehicle and get back to work. I love my job which is ironically finding others jobs. Here I am a job expert who cannot find a job. Karma is real and good deeds do not go un-noticed. God bless anyone helping those in need. This world needs more kindness, more love and more understanding. We need love. Not hate. Generosity is a loving gesture. People with big hearts and kindness will be rewarded always. I have never asked for help like this. But I had to really humble myself and be realstic with myself. I have a 2001 car with 165k miles. I have a wheelchair that is 15 years oldGiven how difficut its been finding and keeping work, I have to do this. I have to do this for my twin girls. I have to do this for my girlfriend. I have to do this for ME. As an aging paraplegic, I am not the prototype employee lard companies look for. In fact I deal with discrimination with my disability and more recently my age. Ageism is the most prominent discrimination out there. As I get older, finding open minded companies becomes more diffiult. I appreciate any help. I truly do appreciate the generosity people often show. My life has been a challenge and extremely humbling. I rarely ever ask for help from anyone. But thats where I am now. I need help. I wil forever be grateful if I can buy a reliable car. God bless anyone who believes in helping others- John HSome of you may know local San Diegans, Marin and Mike Mejia, fromFloaties Swim School where they swim with their daughter, Avalon. This January, they were expecting their second daughter. During the pregnancy, this amazing family\\'s life was changed forever when Marin was diagnosed with advanced cancer.November 2015On November 25th, their baby girl Owen Eleanor Amelia Mychal Yaple Mejia (great story behind the name), was delivered two months early via C-section to avoid further delay in Marin\\'s cancer treatment.She weighed 4lbs, 5oz and was 16 3/4 inches long. Owen is now home, healthy, and growing everyday! Marin was given a month to recover from surgery, followed by six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation.February 2015Marin recently finished her treatment and her road to recovery is going to be a long one. During this time, the family has needed to make space in their home for baby Owen. Having two growing daughters, Mike decided to take on the remodel of the home with the help of family and friends. Remodeling a new bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen is a giant task in itself and of course Mike\\'s top priorities are caring for his wife during cancer treatment and his two young daughters. Mike has served his community as a San Diego firefighter for close to twenty years, but now he needs your help. The Mejia Family has been through more than anyone can imagine and this is where Savvy Interiors and you can help make a difference! With your donations to offset medical costs and get Marin and her family back in their home, we\\'re asking you to give back.April 2015Please have Marin in your thoughts and prayers. She could can use all the positive energy she can get. She recently finished her treatments, and the cancer responded well to the treatment. Unfortunately some of the cancer has spread to her lungs. She\\'ll be going back into treatment very soon. Baby Owen is doing great! Now 4 months old she\\'s smiling andlaughing. She\\'s an absolute blessing for the Mejias.We\\'ll be hosting an event withKid Ventures Saturday April 11, 2015 to help offset medical expenses and help them get back in their home, since the family has been displaced for the last 2 months.Fundraising Event:  https://www.facebook.com/events/1377090929283202/ Savvy Interiors, LLC , is a local boutique design firm that works in residential design.

Unfortunately, though, at the same time I had to be honest with myself in knowing we couldnt do this alone.Just over 13 years ago, my son - Kevin Lowe - was diagnosed with a brain tumor. I cant begin to explain the rush of emotions that overtook me as the doctor explained everything to us, including the fact that the tumor had completely encased his pituitary gland and was pressing against both his carotid artery and his optic nerve.The shock of this discovery finally explained Kevins many health issues, such as the severe migraine headaches that had plagued Kevin since he was a toddler, and the slowly diminishing eyesight that was lost forever when the tumor was removed.The years since have not been easy. I have watched my son lose his independence, lose his friends, lose the things that he had always loved. He has had to standby as his dream truck and four wheeler were eventually sold, ultimately closing an independent chapter of his life.But you know what, through it all Kevin has woken up each day with a smile on his face and has found his way through the darkness being sure to give all the credit to his unwavering faith. Kevin began receiving orientation and mobility training after losing his eyesight, but it was always based upon learning a fixed route that would take him from point A to Point B and back again. This is fine for navigating his way in places that he is familiar with, but for those that he is not, it can pose a challenge. I have seen where this has limited my sons independence in his attempt at living a normal life despite his blindness.Recently we learned of a 501(c) (3) Non-Profit organization in California headed by Daniel Kish called World Access For The Blind (WAFTB) that is teaching blind persons of all ages to see with sound. Their scientifically-proven FlashSonar - a specialized form of human echolocation - in combination with their pioneering full-length cane training and No Limits philosophy, has enabled thousands of blind persons to achieve what they call Perceptual Freedom.\\n\\nOnce thought to be something only dolphins and bats could do, FlashSonar involves making sharp clicking sounds with the tongue on the roof of the mouth. WAFTB has partnered in scientific research that has proven the returning echoes reflecting off surrounding objects activate or light-up the brains visual cortex - the area used for seeing - creating acoustic imagery that enables a blind person to see in a new way.The life-changing results enable blind persons to break-free of a well-intentioned guiding arm, or traveling just between point A and point B, and other cycles of isolation and dependence to live a more self-directed life of independence, achievement and dignity.What a monumental impact and blessing that would be for Kevin. We have a chance for him to do one-on-one training with WAFTB Perceptual Navigation Instructor Brian Bushway over a week in June, and follow-up training in the future, but we need help in covering the training and travel costs for the first phase which, unfortunately, aren\\'t covered by insurance. \\n\\nKevin is very excited to have a chance to train with Brian, who was also formerly a student himself at WAFTB who went on to obtain his Orientation and Mobility degree as well as a Master\\'s degree in Special Education.You can learn more about Brian\\'s journey in the video aboveand see why, in the video below, he\\'s such an inspiration to Kevin because of his work with a student named Rob who journeyed from Wales to Los Angeles in search of the same \\'Perceptual Freedom\\'.And you can learn more about the breadth and scope of the work done globallyby World Access For The Blind in the video below.\\n\\nYou can also learn more about WAFTBat their website .If there is any amount of money that you would be willing to donate to help make this trip possible so that Kevin can receive this life-changing training, we would be so grateful.We thank you in advance for any help you might be able to offer.God Bless!This fundraiser is for our friend Molly who is one of the best, most selfless, human beings we\\'ve ever met. As some of you may know, and for those that dont, Molly has been battlingMetastatic Breast Cancer (stage 4) for four years now. Unfortunately though the cancer has spread into her spine, her lymph nodes, lungs, and up near her heart and her prognosis isnt good now. Molly has been married for 26 years to the love of her life Darren, and last year suddenly became a mom again to her beautiful grandson Vinnie. Taking care of a small child and family is tough enough for anyone, but doing it and having stage 4 breast cancer is even tougher, but Molly is a fighter and family is everything to her, so she marches on with a smile on her face and love in her heart. Shes always one to lend a hand to someone in need, and her kind and compassionate caring of others makes her an even more beautiful soul. In the 26 years that she and her husband have been married, they have only had one real vacation and in the past four years with the cancer diagnosis it has financially set them back. Her one main wish is for her husband to have one last wonderful memory of them together doing something on her list so that he will have that forever after she is gone.So its time to give back to our friend Molly. Its time to give something to her that will help give them that lasting memory that she so desperately wants to give her husband before she goes, and with your help we can all make this happen. We thank you from the bottom or our hearts in advance. You are all beautiful and loved. Here is a bit of Mollys bucket list:* A trip to Florida A trip to Hawaii A cruise to anywhere Disney World Universal Florida Go to a Steelers GameShe would also like people to be more aware of what MBC is, and so here is a link to tell you more:13 Facts Everyone Should Know about Metastatic Breast CancerKenny is a 16 year old boy that\\'s a junior at ILHS, and lives with his mom, Carol, andsister, Haley. His father passed away 2 years ago in August from stage 4 lung cancer. Things have been incredibly hard in the past 2 years because Jerry was the main provider for the family. Carol started working but Kenny started to get very sick, in and out of the doctors. He had blood drawn on his visit to the doctors & the results came back that he had a white blood cell count of 0. On 10/22 Kenny was rushed to Dartmouth Hitchcock hospital because of having no blood cells, he was there for 8 days. Between many blood cultures taken & a bone marrow biopsy,there were no conclusive results pointing them into the direction of a diagnosis. He was given an anti biotic that seemed to help bring his white cell count up to 500, at which point he wasdischarged to go home. Days went on where Kenny still felt very tired and not himself, doing half days of school and some days he couldn\\'t even get out of bed. He tried to go to school 11/23 but was sent home with a fever which brought him back to the doctors to get blood drawn. Results came back Monday night that his cells were back down to 0, this time he was taken to Boston Children\\'s Hospital. They also took blood cultures and did a bone marrow biopsy, and Wednesday night they broke the news that they had found cancer cells in Kenny\\'s bone barrow. He was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia on 11/25/15. This was such a shock and the doctors told him that he would be starting chemo that Friday in forms of steroids, shots & IV. He will be in Boston Children\\'s Hospital for a month to be monitored but his chemo treatment will be 2 years long. However, when he is released he will still have to come back & forth to Boston very frequently for treatment. As you can imagine this is a huge financial burden on a family that was already struggling trying to recover from the passing of Jerry only two years ago.Carol has been in Boston staying with Kenny which means she\\'s not able to work right now. Haley goes back and forth between Boston and home so she can still be working to ease the financial burden on Carol of the every day expenses of gas, food, utilities,etc. These are expenses we all deal with but on top of all of this, they now have the ENORMOUS medical expenses ahead of them along with the cost of Carol having to buy meals every day, pay for parking in the gargage at Children\\'s Hospital, gas and wear and tear of getting back and forth from Meredith NH to Boston for the next two years. Anything donated will help & be greatly appreciated, especially at this time of year! This family has been through more than we could ever imagine so the more we can spread the word, hopefully the more can be raised so Carol & Haley can concentrate on being there for Kenny. PLEASE PLEASE donate and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, share this with as many people as possible.thank you!!!As many of you probably know, Todd Perry has been on a waiting list for a kidney and pancreas transplant for many years.

RLTW,Travis Roth http://m.army.mil/article/54061/ranger-family-seeks-treatment-for-spinal-muscular-atrophyAlright friends (and strangers) I wanna try something out here. First of all, this post is relatively long in this world of tweets and texts. It will probably take you a whole 4-5 minutes to read, which is pretty much an eternity in today\\'s fast paced world, but I beg of you to please continue on. Please give me 5 minutes of your time. Please and thank you.For starters, if you were tagged in a post that brought you here, congratulations! You should feel honored. It means the friend that tagged you, believes you\\'re an amazing person! They believe you are compassionate, caring and willing to help others in need. Most importantly, they believe in YOU! This weekend at work I met a young girl named Bree from Greenville, South Carolina. Bree is the sweetest little soft spoken young lady you\\'ll ever meet. She loves her friends, her family and she loves to dance. Bree is currently fighting an extremely rare disease called cystinosis. Only an estimated 500 people in the U.S. currently have this disease and only roughly 2,000 in the entire world. Due to it\\'s rarity, funding and awareness for Cystinosis is very limited. The life expectancy of those diagnosed with this disease is only 30 years. The good news is five years ago the life expectancy was even younger; so who knows, with more significant scientific break throughs, public funding, and a little bit of hope, maybe that age will climb higher and higher in the years to come.Now a little bit about me. Last Friday I celebrated my 33rd birthday.I was fortunate enough to enjoy a few days off with my lovely girlfriend down in New Orleans celebrating. We had an awesome time. On top of that, I was so grateful for all the well wishes I received from many friends and family members alike here on Facebook. It was such a kind reminder of all the great people I have in my life. I met Bree the following day and maybe it was the timing of it all, but it really hit me hard: It must not only be frightening for her, but I can\\'t even begin to imagine how she goes about her day to day life. It must be difficult to simply \\'have fun\\' knowing her time here will most likely be cut short due to this awful disease. It saddened me deeply. I thought about how fortunate I am, how fortunate the majority of us are, to have had such blessed and carefree childhoods. Adversely, the day to day struggles that Bree bravely battles are nearly incomprehensible to say the least.No child should ever have to deal with these kinds of worries. No child should have to grow up that quick. Bree should be able to just \\'be a kid.\\' Just be a kid and \\'have fun.\\' SO HERE\\'S MY IDEA:We\\'ve all seen the incredible powers of the Internet and crowd funding. We\\'ve seen memes, videos and simple comments spread like wildfire. The potential is limitless. And that\\'s where YOU come in!1. Go donate ANYTHING to the gofundme campaign in the link provided. 5, 10, 20 measly bucks. I\\'d be willing to bet a couple days from now you won\\'t even notice it\\'s gone. 2. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!!! Once you\\'re done with step one, share this post to your Facebook wall and nominate 5 friends to donate and nominate 5 friends of their own as well.*BE SMART ABOUT WHO YOU NOMINATE/TAG! The first criteria is obvious: you want to tag someone YOU ARE CERTAIN will follow through. On top of that, be sure to pick some friends from different groups, areas, etc. so we can reach the largest audience possible.That\\'s it!  $5 and 5 minutes of your time.$5 and 5 minutes seems like a very small price to pay to help a child out who has already been through more than any of us can possibly fathom.$5 and 5 minutes to have a profound and positive impact on a young child\\'s wellbeing and happiness.$5 and 5 minutes to \\'help Bree have fun.\\'Obviously money alone can\\'t buy happiness, but it can help alleviate the worries of financial burden and provide financial freedom for expenses such as toys, shows, vacations, fun events and joyous experiences. That\\'s where your donations will go. Who knows, maybe Bree will even want to donate to research or other things or people she finds as important as we find her. It\\'s that easy guys. These small donations, COLLECTIVELY, will go a long way.Once this snowball gets rolling, there\\'s no telling how large it will become. Wouldn\\'t that be cool to be a part of it? Wouldn\\'t that make you feel good?Thank you all so, so much and I\\'m excited to see how this pans out. Please message me if you need further details, have questions or ideas. Know that YOU are appreciated, and know that YOU are making a difference.Thank you again,With love, happiness and hope,AndyMy name is Charles Waller and I have been rearing my two children, CJ and Elise, as a single parent for almost six years.

He has six children and a wife at home. An average day for Josh is waking up bright and early in the morning to walk an hour and a half to The Brick (a restaurant in downtown Milledgeville) to make it to work on time, where he works as a cook for a low wage. As soon as his shift ends at The Brick, he makes his long, dangerous walk to Applebee\\'s (on North Columbia St.) where he also works as a cook until 12:00 am on weekdays, and 1:00 am on weekends. After he gets off of work at Applebee\\'s he makes the next long walk home.I give Josh rides when I can, but I can\\'t always be there to make sure he gets home safely. He is an extremely hard working, caring man with a kind heart, and he needs a reliable car to drive to and from his house, and in between jobs. He has car insurance, previously had a car, but it has broken down and he just can\\'t afford to pay to get it fixed/buy another car. It would mean the world to him, and me, if we could come together to make sure Josh does not freeze while walking home this season. Anyone who works as hard as Josh does deserves a way to get home and more. This is the least I can do. Every little bit helps. Thank you!-LindseyHave you ever had a dream? Have you wanted to make that dream happen but had no Motivation or mentor? Well Pararescue Jumper Mike Maroney, has a dream too but his dream is to continue his Pararescue ideals by helping people get motivated and help their dreams come true. What this fund is for it is going to help Mike Maroney set up a motivational Pod Cast and a Motivational speaking website and business. In September it is looking like he will be having his first motivational speech at Waterford Kettering High school, in Michigan, with Mike having 18 years of service, 9 deployments, being credited with 1,000 saved life and the most saved life\\'s during Hurricane Katrina at 152, I think it is time to give back to him and help him, and show that we appreciate what he has done for our country and people all around the world, thank you.For any refugee of war, adjusting to a new life in America can be quite a challenge. Its all the more difficult for a 14-year-old kid with cerebral palsy. Meet Alan.A Syrian Kurdish boy from Qamishli, Alan arrived in Clarkston, GA nearly a year ago with his mother, father and two sisters. Alans cerebral palsy occurred during birth. It severely affects his motor skills, balance, and speech. Before the war, he had been doing better, his father said. But once the fighting reached Qamishli, he was cut off from the physical therapy that can keep his muscles strong and his joints flexible. Over time, Alan lost the ability to walk and to speak and to chew food. His most functional muscles appear to be those he uses to smile, which he does often. He hams it up for the camera, and he grins mischievously at any mention of his penchant for playing sick to get out of school.  Clarkston is a wonderfully diverse community, and Alan and his family are deeply grateful for the warm welcome theyve received. Still, it\\'s no walk in the park. They live in a complex behind the jail, several miles from the nearest grocery store, without a car. To get Alan to his physical therapy sessions, they rely on good Samaritans, or they take the bus  two, in fact, for two hours each way. Our goal:We want to find his family a van to make life a bit easier. We will withdraw the funds under my name to purchase a van for the family once we reach our goal.Who are we?We are friends of this beautiful family and feel very connected to them.Heval Kelli is a cardiology fellow at Emory University and himself a former refugee from Syria who arrived in Atlanta 15 years ago with no family and no friends. Vanja Pantic is a humanitarian and former refugee from Bosnia, who has been giving back to her community since her family was resettled in Clarkston 20 years ago. Patrick Adams is a freelance journalist and photographer, who reports on health, development and conflict.Let\\'s give\\nDhananjay Sharma and his team the appreciation they deserve. Let him know that the\\nperson like him and his work has not gone unnoticed.  \\n(Watch the\\ninterview first or look below for the timing of the important segments of the\\ninterview if you don\\'t have the whole 40 minutes.)\\nIt is terrible that this person and his team haven\\'t gotten appropriate recognition and admiration for going beyond their way to\\nhelp disadvantaged kids get education comparable to that of the  private\\nschools. \\nToday, principals\\nof all privatized institutions in Nepal are businessmen. They are monetizing\\neducation. They have a big house, a nice car, and ridiculous money. They are\\nalso given the tags of successful people. \\nMeanwhile, outstanding performance, like of Dhananjay Sharma, goes unnoticed because it cannot be instantly monetized. As a society, we\\nare discouraging people like him by overlooking his hard earned\\naccomplishments.\\nTherefore, like-mined people like us can show how\\nvaluable he is to our society. Donation is not the only way to show that we care.  Sharing this interview or making him known to others, are\\nalternatives to a donation. You can help this fundraiser get to a person who is\\ncapable of making a donation. So let\\'s share it!  \\nRaised\\nmoney will be used for sponsoring students who can\\'t pay $1.15 (Rs.100)\\nfees of this school, expanding infrastructure of the school, buying supplies or in anyway his team thinks is appropriate. \\nLet him\\nknow that we care!!

In fact, our running joke is \"Where there\\'s a Will, there\\'s a way\" because it doesn\\'t matter what someone suggests needs to be done, he\\'ll find a way to get it done and he\\'ll do it immediately!\\n\\n\\nBack in May, we thought that Will had gotten injured. We knew he\\'d be out of work for a bit, but we had some savings and thought things would be fine. Little did we know what we were in for. As the last 3 months have worn on, Will has gotten worse. What began as, what we thought was,a possible muscle strain has taken a turn into being a possible neurological or auto-immune disorder. Will\\'s legs went from occasional pain to giving out more and more frequently to the point that if he didn\\'t have his crutches, he would fall. On August 4th, this peaked. Will couldn\\'t stand more than a couple minutes and his arms and face began going numb, along with his vision going blurry. This earned him a 4 day hospital stay with almost every test that exists being run on him. Nothing has been confirmed, though, because in a frustrating turn of events, none of the tests came back with anything to help doctors solidify a diagnosis.\\n\\n\\nThe entire experience has left usemotionally drained. We are trying to keep life as normal as possible for the kids, but it\\'s not easy to mask the fact that Will has gone from a hard-working, hard-playing dad to someone who has to use a walker to get around and can\\'t even open a peanut butter jar.\\n\\n\\nIt has also left us financially drained. As a last resort, we have turned to this. We have exhausted our savings and short term diability has helped, but isn\\'t much and is about to run out. I am looking for ways to bring in more income, but am also the only one able to drive right now, so I have been running Will to his numerous appointments. We have hit the point that our phones have been shut off (which is interferring with my freelance jewelry job), Internet is about to be cut (again, needed for my freelance job), electrical is about to be shut off, car payments are behind, insurance is about to be cut off, and the medical co-pays are beginning to mount. We are barely scraping together money for groceries. To be honest, I hate doing this, but I also know that someday we\\'ll find a way to pay it forward.\\n\\n\\nWe thank you tremendously for anything you give to help us keep afloat right now and please know that it is greatly appreciated!Hello,My Name Is Demone Harlan, Owner Of RockysWingz & Catering. Overall, I\\'m just one hard working brother from Nashville, TN. Some people label me asdriven, consistent, or a model of perserverance, but to meI\\'m just a humble servant everyday to the city of Nashville. My journey started almost 6years ago (March 2011) inside my mother\\'s kitchen. Of courseI had some down falls, but I never let thatmake me quit. Believing in myself gave people motivation throughout the city, and I started to recieve a lot of attention from my hard work and dedication. Mostof my friends and family told me to go for my dream, so I stepped out on faith not knowing it could be a long and tiring journey. I realize I havea few reasons I work so hard. The energy that drives my vision comes from the thought of my daughter\\'s future, and the continuedsmiles I see on my costumer\\'s faces everyday. I love what I do and I will continue to work hard to get where I need to be. It\\'s been over 3 years and my clientel has increased to heights I didn\\'t think I would see at this point, soI want to give a special thanks to all of my customers over the past few years. My customers give me motivation everyday and without themthere wouldn\\'t be Rocky\\'s Wingz. My vision is to purchase a food truck and or building to service all of Nashville and the surrounding counties. Somepeople continue to tell me they can\\'t get to me because of my work hours/location and that just motivates me to work harder. So I\\'m asking for a donation to my RWC FUND. I want to be living proof and share my story to those who have similar dreams.Thanks for your time and belief in RockysWingz & Catering. Peace and LoveHello Friends,I was born with a birth defect of my right arm. I\\'ve adapted very well considering.Growing up I\\'ve excelled at baseball, hockey, even played the electric guitar and drove a five speed Honda!However at this point in my life,I find myself needing a prosthetic arm to fulfill my fitness goals. Without it, its not possible..So I\\'m asking for help, as the expenses are sky high, and insurance isn\\'t any help.. ( not life threatening) go figure! I\\'m determined to get this. Anything will help..Thank youEvanAka nubby#NublifeThank you and god bless you all!!!The Dream: For the past (almost) seven years I have devoted my life to creating a space where women can grow and flourish , and I want to spend the next year taking the studio to the next level  The Hip Circle Empowerment Center. I need your contributions to make this dream a reality.Mission: Through dance, fitness, and community we empower ALL women to believe they are strong, beautiful, and worthy of attention.Vision: The Hip Circle Empowerment Center is a safe space for women of all ages, backgrounds, and economic status. It brings together women from across societal boundaries for shared experiences. Through dance and fitness, women are empowered to joyfully inhabit their bodies. Through personal and professional development, women are empowered to courageously accomplish their goals. Through involvement in the studio community, women are empowered to confidently make their voices heard.Details: I have the expertise and experience to make this growth transition a reality, and the women and girls in our community NEED this center. What I need are financial resources. The first step in the process is to transition over into a nonprofit entity and apply for 501c3 status. This will help us to deliver empowering services to many more women. Thats where you come in  your contributions now will help me cover the legal costs to organize and file. Anything above and beyond our current goal will go towards doing other behind-the-scenes work to make this transition happen.How you can help: Your contribution is NOT tax deductible. Right now, youre putting your trust in me and my dream of transitioning the studio into the Hip Circle Empowerment Center. Your funds will be used for legal and administrative costs to make this dream a reality. I am not soliciting funds for the planned nonprofit services here. We will let you know once the Hip Circle Empowerment Center can accept tax deductible donations. We will need them to function and will appreciate your support. I will update everyone who contributes at every step of the process so you can see the work Im doing to bring the Center to life. My timeline is aggressive and I have every intention of being able to open our doors no later than June 1, 2018 (8 years to the day from when I first opened the doors of Hip Circle Studio).Next Steps: I am in the process of gathering together a group of strong women to serve as our initial board of directors and am doing preliminary budgeting and planning alongside the work of keeping Hip Circle Studio open for business. If you have experience, expertise, and interest in being more involved in what Im creating please let me know  it will take many hands to make light of all the work involved.Thank you for reading, contributing, or sharing (or all of the above) Malik Turley, Change Instigator'),\n",

I have been traveling and speaking \\nto various groups about achievement, advocacy, and my platform. I work as a \\nRehabilitation Technologist, so it is a natural extension to make my platform \\n\"Equality through Technology\". I am very passionate about architectural \\naccessibility and getting the right tools into the hands of people with \\ndisabilities to \"level the playing field\". I now have the privilege of \\nrepresenting Kentucky at the Ms. Wheelchair \\nAmerica national pageant in July, in Houston ... if I can raise enough funds \\nto go. The mission of Ms. Wheelchair America is to \\nprovide an opportunity of achievement for women who happen to be wheelchair \\nusers to successfully educate and advocate for the more than 54 million \\nAmericans living with disabilities. Unlike traditional beauty pageants, Ms. \\nWheelchair America is not a contest to select the most attractive individual. It \\nis instead a competition based on advocacy, achievement, communication and \\npresentation to select the most accomplished and articulate spokeswoman for \\npersons with disabilities. The selected representative must be able to \\ncommunicate both the needs and the accomplishments of her constituency to the \\ngeneral public, the business community and the legislature.I have \\nMuscular Dystrophy. Before getting my wheelchair in 2008, I earned an Master\\'s \\nin Computer Science and worked at Edwards Air Force Base. After getting my \\nwheelchair I took up surfing with Life Rolls On, \\ntraveled to Scotland, and earned a 2nd Master\\'s degree, and moved to Kentucky to \\nwork as a Rehabilitation Technologist.  For my job, I help find the appropriate \\ntechnology for persons with disabilities and provide training.  My caseload \\nincludes students, people in various work environments, home modifications, \\nwheelchair selection, and farm equipment modification. The first half is \\ndue in mid-May, and the second half is due in mid-June. All funds raised over \\nand above what I need will go directly to the Ms. Wheelchair \\nKentucky organization.

As some of you know, I will be competing this December for the Title of Miss Pennsylvania USA! So exciting, I know!!! This is my last and final year of being eligible to compete, so I\\'m hoping to go out with a bang and bring home the crown :) I have been preparing for the competition since June and cannot wait to proudly represent Philadelphia. Pageants can be expensive and I need all the help and support I can get! I\\'ve set this page up to keep everyone updated about my progress and also as a way of gaining sponsors. All types of donations are welcome, being personal or from a buisness! I will be representing Philadelphia as a community and would be humbled to receive donations from local buisnesses, organizations and friends! Hopefully you guys can take me to Miss PA and then ultimately Miss USA.A little bit of why I am competing;  I know, I know.....being the female empowerment type of chick I am, it sounds hypocritical to be competing in a \"beauty pageant\" but let me bust the myth about pageants! The term beauty pageant has been married to the negative stigma of showcasing and judging physcial attributes based on a woman\\'s body and beauty. But what most people don\\'t see is that yes, although beauty plays a role in the competition, beauty is also judged as a woman\\'s confidence in her own body, mind and soul. At 26, I will be one of the oldest competitors in the pageant, but I\\'ve never felt more sexy, confident, and successful as a woman! I would want nothing more than to share my confidence with other women and inspire/promote young ladies to strive for similar success.Having a background in community nursing and a Master\\'s in Women\\'s Health I naturally chose the promotion of women\\'s health and wellness as my platform. My passion and desire to educate women about their bodies drives me to bring public awareness and education about staying healthy, preventing disease and healing issues using different medical/ non medical methods. My ultimate dream would to become a public health figure and I believe that becoming Miss Pennsylvania is a great start!!! So please help support my cause in competing and furthering my goal of educating women that their happiness, health and success is all in their power.I believe in leading by example and about 2 years ago, after suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis for 10 years, I decided to take charge of my health. I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired! I wanted heal myself physically and mentally so I decided to get active and joined a Crossfit gym, changed my diet and rid my body of awful toxins I call processed foods!!!, began the practice of yoga, and invested my time in learning about other medical practices. I have never been happier and healthier than I currently am, and it all starts with a little motivation. I would love to empower and motivate others to make lifestyle changes.   \" I am here to serve. I am here to inspire. I am here              to love. I am here to live my truth.\"                      -Deepak Chopra      \"Strength is beauty and beauty is Strength\"We all have dreams and Im hoping you - my dear friends and family - will help support one of mine. Ever since I was little girl, one of the things I always dreamt of doing, was participating in a pageant. Life has a funny way of working out, so that opportunity never became a reality, until now. I have never felt more confident in my life, and in my career I have been able to become a role model to people of all ages in the community.New Jersey shaped me into the woman I am, Syracuse helped groom me a bit more, and now Im proud to call Erie home, and would love nothing more than to represent the Flagship City in the Miss Pennsylvania USA pageant. Besides earning the coveted title and crown, and putting Erie on the map, winning this pageant would give me the opportunity to work closely with causes close to my heart, including education for all, and cancer research and awareness.Of course, this venture comes with a price tag, and Im hopeful you, my friends from near and far, will be able to help defray my sponsorship and associated fees. Any donation means the world to me! Thank you so much for your continued support!Love always, DanielleP.S. Jersey friends, we have a bake sale coming up this Father\\'s Day weekend. Be on the lookout for updates on that way you can support.Harper has been nominated as a finalist in the upcoming National America Miss Pageant.

Bennings and I am currently a rising junior at Clark Atlanta University from Las Vegas, Nevada. I am an Early Childhood Education major with a minor in English. I have been selected as an official contestant for Miss United Negro College Fund Scholarship Pageant. The United Negro College Fund is the nations largest and most effective minority education organization since 1944. I am a Deans List Scholar and I serve as a Student Ambassador for Clark Atlanta Universitys Office of Admissions. This past year, I had the distinct honor of holding the title of Miss Campus Activities Board 2014- 2015. My most recent endeavor is becoming a charter member of Educating Youth Everywhere Campus Charter Organization. If chosen as Miss UNCF, my platform will be S.C.H.O.L.A.R Spawning Change Holistically through Opportunity, Leadership and Reinvention. I will implement my platform by making scholarships more accessible to students to increase retention rates, provide a leadership institute to students which will consist of resume building, instruct students on how to properly conduct themselves as a leader, and to reinvent the way students think when it comes to their academic and financial stability. Should I win the title of Clark Atlanta Universitys Miss United Negro College Fund, I would have the opportunity to compete for the National Miss UNCF title. The deadline for the fundraiser is August 26, 2015 at 3pm. Any questions, please feel free to contact my advisor, Shawn Gardener at (404) 880-8883 or via email at sgardner@cau.edu.

I had the chance of a lifetime when I was crowned Miss Panama in 2012. I now know that I have a passion for this, I love having the chance to be a role model for many young girls because I love enlighting positivity and motivation into their lives. This is more than just a pageant to me, this is a dream. Miss California Latina will open many doors for me and any donation, truly any will be a great help to get to my goal. Please help me get one step closer to a life long dream. Thank you all so much <3Hello, my name is Bliss Welch. I was recently crowned Ms Wheelchair Tennessee 2013. I am rasing funds for my entry fee to the Ms Wheelchair America pageant held in Houston, TX from July 15th-21st. It is my goal to raise these funds one dollar at a time and to have a donation from all 50 states. Yes, you read that correctly, I want to raise $1,943.00 from 1,943 different individuals.

The final competition will take place on November 7, 2015 in Springfield, Ohio. All of the rehearsals and meetings leading up to the event will take place in Springfield, which will require me to travel. I started this page to raise money to help with fees, wardrobe, headshots, accommodations and all other expenses.Any contribution you can make would be more than appreciated. No amount is too small. It takes a village to raise a child. I am inviting you to be a member of my village and help prepare me to become Miss Ohio Teen USA 2016.Ashauna-Verne\\'Crowned in November of 2014, Kelsey Dacus is Miss Springfield 2015. When asked why she wanted to participate in Miss Springfield, her answer was simply, \"For my kids.\" Anyone that knows her, knows that statement refers to every single child in the foster care system, that Kelsey will claim as \"her\" kids, to give them a sense of belonging. Kelsey has such a passion for spreading awareness about the absolute need for foster families and adoptive families in not just the Springfield region, but all over Missouri. In Springfield, she\\'s involved in multiple Foster Care organizations, holds a job working as a residential specialist at a residential facility for children with behavioral disorders, and is a visiting resource to two children in the Foster Care system. Kelsey is also very involved in Children\\'s Miracle Network, Miss America\\'s national philanthropy. CMN offers funds to children needing hospital treament, travel expenses, and equipment expenses. She visits local pediatric wings to spend time with these children and their families regularly. Being Miss Springfield, she has the opportunity to compete in Miss Missouri, a preliminary for Miss America. There are five categories to be judged: Evening Wear, On-Stage Question, Interview, Talent, and Swimwear. Miss Missouri does come at quite a high expense. Between wardrobe, fundraisers for her platform issue, travel expenses, talent coaching, and music expenses, it adds up. Kelsey is a student at Missouri State University, taking 16 credit hours, working two jobs, and volunteering over 30 hours a week doing appearances and working with different foster care organizations and Children\\'s Miracle Network.This fundraiser is to help get Kelsey to Miss Missouri. Giving a donation would help jumpstart Kelsey into reaching her end goal: Becoming Miss Missouri, and spreading awareness for the children that mean so much to her. Your donations will not only help Kelsey, but help children in the foster care system, and children benefitting from Children\\'s Miracle Network.EVERY donation ensures a signed autograph card from Kelsey and a personal note. $50-signed autograph card, personal note, appearance from Miss Springfield for any event at your request. $100 or more-signed autograph card, personal note, appearance from Miss Springfield for any event at your request, & and plaque, thanking you or your business for your sponsorship.Saludos Mi nombre es Paulina Garcia Martell, estudio en la Academia Sangermea y curso el 2do grado.

The platform I will be representing is Domestic Violence especially targeted towards women.A private, non-profit organization that I would like to mention is 180 Turning Lives Around. I will be in efforts to show women that they are worth so much more than the trauma that they go through and that with the proper help, it can get better. Did you know?30% of Americans say they know a woman who has been physically or mentally abused by her husband or boyfriend in the past year. This is not acceptable and I will stand before many and spread this positive message and try my best to make a change. My hopes are to lower that statistic and to make my own program one day. Any donation amount or sponsorship would mean the world to me, so please, support me in my future efforts and for Miss New Jersey Competition in October! Thank you.Becoming Miss Rodeo Florida has been a dream of mine since I was six years old. My dream finally became a reality in September of 2013. My yearas Miss Rodeo Florida has been an experince like none other!! I have met many incredible people this past year that have opened up multiple opportunities. My Family has been so supportive and understand throughout my life, but especially this past year. My mom has been the most motivating, determined, and persistant person in my life. She is a single parent that has shaped me into the woman I am today! And for that, I am forever grateful. Rodeo is my passion and I want people to feel the same way I do! Miss Rodeo America is the next step on this exciting ride and it would be a great honor to be the first Florida girl to bring the crown home to the Sunshine State!\\n\\nMy year of traveling has relied on sponsorships and monetary donations.

Many of you may be personal friends, family, and some of you may not know me at all. So here is a little about me, and what I am trying to achieve.I am a wife, mother of four, active member of Truth Ministries Calvary Chapel Church, student, a health and fitness advocate, and a full-time personal trainer. I am also a local resident of Espanola, New Mexico.Health and fitness has been a huge part of my life since I was very young. Throughout my school years I was an active cheerleader and martial arts student.  As I got older I became more involved in fitness, and eventually was introduced to weight training, which I fell in love with. It has become my passion, which in turn lead me to get certified as a personal trainer. As a personal trainer, my goal is inspire and motivate other\\'s. I am committed to excellence and love motivating others to live a healthy lifestyle, as well as helping them to achieve their fitness goals.  It has been a dream of mine for some time to compete in a fitness competition, as a bikini/figure bodybuilder. I consider this to be a calling, and a passion for me. In turn, I want to inspire others to follow their dreams. At the age of 36, I am in the best shape of my life.  Ihave worked and trained even harder the past 16 weeks for this show.I feel that no matter what obstacles we face in life, they can be conquered. I am starting to develop and build my legacy, which will be found in my efforts. This is where you come in., and where you will be part of my success. Budget is key here, and funding is critical to fund my below listed competition expenses. The competition is the Fitness Southwest Championships Show located in Albuquerque, New Mexico and is sheduled for November, 1, 2014. My goal is to raise $1500 to help cover the cost of my competition expenses. Expenses include:Fitness Universe Membership $50Event Registration $150Event Registration $100Hotel $121Competition Suit $225Themewear $200Jewlery $50Tanning $189Shoes $50Hair/Makeup $140Nails/Pedicure $80Posing Classes $150Nutrition Help last few weeks $200I know that I have awesome family, friends, and supporters that will help me reach my goal, so that I can fulfill my dream of becoming a bikini/figure competitor. If you are a business, I will proudly strut your logo all weekend log on my attire.The saying, \"Never Give Up, the harder the struggle, the more glorious the triumph\" serves as a constant reminder that whatever it is in life you dream of doing, whatever goal you want to achieve, you must remember to go after it, and to \"Never Give Up.\"Your generous contribution will support me in going after my dream. Thank you in advance for your generous support!Thank you to everyone who supported us at the national competition of the 2013 @Miss United States Pageant during Independence Day celebrations in Washington D.C. It was more than memorable; it was an opportunity to represent our community and share our platform of music performance therapy. We learned so much about ourselves, about what it takes to compete on a national level, how to remain gracious, balanced, and classy regardless of situation. From LA, to Charlotte, to Arlington, to Seattle, to San Diego and home; everywhere we went we met folks who wished us well and shared their love for the islands. Aloha is alive and well, you just need to put your aloha out there. Mahalo to each and everyone of you who believed in us and helped us on this journey. This has been one of the most memorable experiences of our lives and we are grateful that you were a part of it.We both look forward to fulfilling the remainder of our reign (through Feb 2014) through participation in community events, sponsor events, and our music therapy project.To stay up to date on our activities, visit our Facebook pages at:Miss Jr Teen Hawaii United States 2013 LonDyn Sydney Look https://www.facebook.com/pages/Miss-Jr-Teen-Hawaii-United-States-2013-LonDyn-Sydney-Look/114954195362875Miss Teen Hawaii United States 2013 Sarah Champayn Look https://www.facebook.com/pages/Miss-Teen-Hawaii-United-States-2013-Sarah-Champayn-Look/139344182910098For information on appearances, please contact our director at hawaiiunitedstatespageant@gmail.com.Hello my name is Alex Andrews, I am nineteen years old and I am convinced that I can change the world. After dealing with low self-worth, depression, and even self-harm I found a new confidence in myself and my leadership abilities. Social media aided in my self-destruction and I feel that social media is the very thing I can use to help others. I am passionate about giving kids and teens confidence through leadership and changing the face of social media to something that promotes positive self-esteem.The best way I know to change the world is through pageantry and using my title to make a difference. I have the opportunity to compete in the Miss Texas competition this summer for the state title and the chanceto represent my amazing home state, and also the chance to advocate for a change in social media on a wider scale.However, pageantry is a little expensive and I want to be able to do the best I can possibly do. This is where I need your help. I need the amazing support of my friends and family to send me to Miss Texas without the worry ofmoney and the expenses I\\'ve had to put on my parents. I want to change the world, and I need your help.Thank you so much!Alex AndrewsMiss South Texas 2015I have been given the opportunity to compete in the Miss Maine 2014 Pageant and I\\'m now searching for some help to make this experience all it can be!

I wascompeting in a motorcycle track event when something broke on my motorcycle and I lost controlhitting a concrete wall. I sustained 2 broken vertebrae in my neck, 6 broken ribs, and 3 shatteredvertebrae in my lower back. The injuries to my lower are what left me paralyzed from the waist down.From that day forward I battled to get back to a normal way of life. Months in the hospital, rehabs,and life adjustments were all a struggle. I am a very competitive person and never had let anythingstop me in the past, and I was not going to let this accident define the rest of my life. While on bedrest I constantly searched for ways to get back that competitive edge that makes up a large part of mypersonality. I finally came across wheelchair bodybuilding, and was instantly inspired by the guys thatcompeted. It gave me a new outlook and motivated me to get back into the gym and do somethingproductive.Less than a year (2008) after my accident I was back in the gym and began a basis weekly routine.Throughout the next two years this routine expanded, and my training became more disciplinedand intense. In 2011, I finally got on stage at the Texas CTS and performed well there. However, theNational Title was always my goal from day one.With the help from my coach (Steve Ioannou), Team Provo, Greg Peterson (Trainer), and Diamond Gym;my prep was hardcore, and physically/mentally draining. I busted my butt to bring the best package tothe National stage in West Palm Beach, FL. Winning this show and becoming an IFBB Pro Athlete was a4 year goal of mine. I had tried to get to Nationals in 2010 and 2011 but never made it due to injuriesand surgery. Winning this past March made it all the struggles in the resent past worth it. To this daysometimes I still can\\'t believe this dream of mine has become reality.Now it\\'s time to perform on the professional stage. The IFBB Pro Wheelchair Championships are onlyweeks away, and I could not be more driven then I am at this moment. I think I can speak for all thewheelchair athletes by saying we all want this sport to continue to grow. Showtime, October 13th isright around the corner. It\\'s time for all the short and long term goals to be tested. Accomplishingpersonal goals are more important than winning no matter how you look at the big picture. I honestlycan say that I couldn\\'t happier with the progress I have in and out of the sport of bodybuilding.I don\\'t look at this accident as the worst day of my life. It was the start of my life. I\\'ve learned so muchsince that tragic day, and now do more to help others than I ever have. I work closely with a non-profit to helpathletes like me, and constantly give to charities. I\\'m regularly reminding myself that it could have beena lot worse. People harp too much on their short coming instead of finding ways to improve them. Allthe wheelchair athletes are perfect examples of overcoming the odds, and attacking adversity head on.This is what I love about the sport; just doing the unthinkable.I hope others gain the motivation that I have through bodybuilding. If anything becomes of my career inthe sport, I hope that others see that life never stops and to keep pushing towards their goals.I hope this short bio helps to inform you a little about my situation. It would be great to have theopportunity to inform the public about the importance of overcoming a tough situation. I\\'m lookingforward to hear back you guys in the near future. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions orif you\\'re looking for more info.Aubrie has been crowned Miss Nevada Amazing Jr. Miss 2015.

Now she is preparing to travel to Virginia Beach in July to compete at IJM Internationals for the title of International Jr. Teen! She is so excited to have been blessed with this incredible opportunity! She always dreamed of winning a title like this, but we never dreamed that it would cost so much to get her there. After adding up the costs involved for the pageant alone, as well as the activities the girls will be participating in, and 1 week in the hotel, I wasquite shocked to see it totalled around $3,500.00! And that is not including travel expenses or food, orfees we\\'ll be paying coaches to get her prepared for competition!I have been pounding the pavement trying to findsponsors, and we areplanning ondoing some fundraisers to helpwith the costs.But I have had some people suggest to me to start a Go Fund Me page. That way, if any friends or family, or anyone with a business that might want todonate anything to help Erin get to Virginia Beach, can do so by simply pulling up her page and typing it in. Thisissuch an exciting time for Erin, and she is so proud to havewonthe title ofIJMAlabama Jr. Teen 2015. And now shereally has her sights set on that International Jr. Teen Title! We know she can do it! She has worked hard for this opportunity, and now that it is actuallyhere, we want to do anything to be sure she gets to experience it. We just never imagined going into this, that if she won, the next step would be so costly! Ifyou can contribute anything at all towards Erin\\'s \"journey\", it would be appreciated more thanwe can say. If everyone I know gave just $5, it would take a huge chunk out of the total, and a huge load of stress off of us! And Erin will be so thrilled and encouraged to have your support! Thank you so much :)!!Hello Family, Friends and Potential Sponsors,     I come to you today to introduce you to a very special young lady.

I have been chosen to represent North Carolina in the Miss Intercontinental United States pageant.I have a VERY short amount of time to raise the money needed for the pageant. I would love to represent our state and without the funding, NC will not be present at nationals. Any bit counts. Every donation will receive a signed headshot, appearance if requested, and many thanks. Anything helps. I have a week to make this happen. Please share with any loved ones or ones you know who can assist me in competing at nationals! Thank you so much for your time!Hello friends and family!For those who don\\'t know me, I am Tianna Tuamoheloa, your reigning Miss Nevada Collegiate 2014! I will be representing the state of Nevada at the National pageant, where I will be competing for the title of Miss Collegiate America 2014 in Orlando, FL! Winning my current title has truly been a life-changing experience. I\\'ve learned so much about myself and have fell in love with my community through servicing others, so much so, it has become a part of who I am now. I have participated in over 35 appearances and service works throughout my reign, all while juggling a FULL school load of 9-12 classes/semester, an active presence in my Greek community and on-campus events, modeling on the side and of course, family time. God has been so good to me and I\\'ve been blessed to be afforded these opportunities. With the support of my community, I know I\\'ll make it on that National stage where I promise to PROUDLY represent the city of Las Vegas and the Silver State. So whether you donate $500, $100, $10, $0.01 or just wish me well, I thank you so much for your incredible support.God Bless!Samoa lo\\'u atunuu pele, ia faamuamua pea le Atua. Fa\\'afetai mo alofaaga <34 years ago I was hopeless....and at my very bottom. I had a decision to make. Change or die. I had nothing and no one left and I knew I had to get healthy; mind body and spirit. I realized if I didn\\'t care about myself nobody else would either.So with a lot of faith, hardwork, and relentless dedication, I am now a happy, healthy, successful, productive member of society. But I couldn\\'t have done it by myself. I had people that I looked up to and turned to in the fitness industry that taught me how to push through and not give up on myself. I want to be able to have that influence on as many others as possible. October 18th in LA, the WBFF (World of beauty fitness and fashion) will be hosting a fitness model competition with a chance for me to earn my professional status as a fitness competitor. This will give me the ability to share my story and my transformation with thousands around the world. Unfortunately, due to recent circumstances, I am having difficulty funding this competition. My hope with this is to raise enough money to get me onto that stage in October and in the running for my \\'pro card\\'. Any little bit helps. To those of you that have been a positive influence and played a part in my transformation, I owe you everything and could not have done it without you. Thank you for believing in me even before I believed in myself. JHWho doesn\\'t like a true underdog story where the team least expected to excel does just that excel. Be part of history in the making & feel what it\\'s like to help support this underdog accomplish what most just dream about doing, getting to nationals!!

This will allow me to join the Miss United States Organization in working closely with the American Cancer Societys Relay for Life. Thank you in advance for your help!\" - Ava Rae Wilson, Little Miss Delaware United States 2014I have recently been chosen, from many applicants throughout the state, as an Official State Finalist in the 2015 Miss New York USA Pageant! This is the first step, in my hopeful journey to becoming Miss USA. Participating in this pageant requires a sponsorship fee of $1500, and I am asking that my friends and fellow Staten Islanders help support my dream in being a national representative of New York.For those of you who do not know me, my name is Christina Caldarera, and I am an extremely ambitious 20 year old. A junior at St. John\\'s University, I will be graduating a year early this coming Spring. Here, I am studying Hospitality Management as well as Business Adminstration. I\\'ve become actively involved in student life and am currently serving as both the President of the United Greek Alliance and the Chief of Staff for Student Government Incorporated. I am a sister of Lambda Chi Sorority, and a member of several honor societies. While balancing my 3.92 GPA, I hold two jobs as well as an internship. My father is a retired Lieutenant from the NYPD, as well as an active alumni to my University. I believe myself to be a proud representation of Staten Island, and the epitome of what it means to be a confident young woman in New York.I am participating in this pageant not only for myself, but for the many girls battling self-confidence issues. I have had to watch too many of my friends suffer from bullying, over the years. This is my stand to show the world that everyBODY is beautiful. Standing only 5ft tall, I would be the shortest pageant girl in the industry. My message to all girls is that there is no dream too big. Just because something about you isn\\'t the norm, doesn\\'t mean it is a flaw. I am ready to confidently step on stage, tiny as I am, and win the state over with my big personality.Staten Island, please stand behind me in my journey to becoming Miss New York USA 2015.My name is Rafael Billy Castellanos, born in San Salvador, El Salvador, and raised in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, my family was notorious for traveling, starting businesses left and right and ambitious as ever...therefore I grew up always dreaming big, driven and taught to never give up on whatever you start no matter what, whether it was me going around door to door selling products my mom wasn\\'t able to sell at her store when i was little, or making jewelry for my mom\\'s business, to bodybuilding, to school, the drive that my parents instilled in me was beyond amazing, i thank them for raising me to always dream and go for your dreams no matter what anyone tells you.                        2006                                          2010                       2004                                  Present 2013It was and still hasn\\'t been an easy road for me, all my life i struggled with my \\nweight, gaining unhealthy eating habits as the years went by with the \\nway fast food was so affordable and easy to \"grab and go\", my weight \\nsky-rocketted..In my teenage years i tipped the scales at 200lbs, standing at 5 feet 4 inches, that\\'s not an ideal weight for anyone, the problem lied where i didn\\'t consider myself fat or overweight..to me, i was perfectly fine, drowning my sadness in food, i was happy.... i faced a rude awakening one day when my friends and i took a picture together at a pool party, I couldn\\'t believe my eyes, i couldn\\'t believe that i looked the way i did... unhappy with what i saw, frustrated, and desperate, i sought out to educate myself, sought out books, read  them, taught myself how to properly eat and With just healthy eating alone i lost 60lbs........not only was i happier but i felt better, much more energy, more confidence!Since that day, i never looked back, i wanted to help others like me, those who are stuck, frustrated, with no idea where to start, i wanted to give them hope that they too can lose the weight.I met some amazing people along the way, some who stayed in my life, and some who didnt, but made a huge impact regardless.After training for a year or so after losing all that weight, i competed in my first Men\\'s Physique show, didnt place, in fact, i placed last, dead last... but to me, i was happy, happy that i had abs, happy that i made the commitment and stuck to it till the end no matter what the results were... placing last fueled my desire to better myself, to come back stronger, and with a vengeance.I met my now trainer/best friend Kiamarse Golmoradi, who has not only inspired me to be the best that i can be, but has dialed in my diet and training to a T, i have never been so confident in myself more than i am now, because of him i also met a wonderful group of Fitness Athletes from the WBFF federation, who not only invited me to join their fitness team \"TeamGenetics\" but have given me such incredible support and motivation, that i\\'m not sure where id be without them. I\\'m forever thankful to my friend Kiamarse Golmoradi, when everyone else turned their back on me, he held out his hand and instead pushed me to go further..Competing in the WBFF Southwest Championships has and is a dream of mine, to take the stage and make those who have supported me through my diets, my training, my good and my bad days, proud of me, but not only that, but to make people out there see that anything is possible, you have the power to change your future, if i can do it, why can\\'t you? i want to inspire, motivate and teach people, But more than anything, help.  *--All proceeds for funding of this project will go to the following:-Evening Wear (suit)-Swimwear (trunks)\\t\\t\\t\\t-Hair, tanning (requirement)-WBFF organization and entry fee.-Diet (food, supplements)The WBFF, The World\\'s Beauty, Fitness and Fashion Federation. http://www.wbffshows.com/This pageant program is an activity sanctioned by the fraternity. All college chapters are encouraged to sponsor a Miss Black & Gold at their individual campuses and support that contestant to the district level. The Miss Black & Gold Pageant competitions are held at a local, district, regional and national level.The Miss Black & Gold Pageant is a competition pageant; however, Alpha Phi Alpha encourages and insists on community building and team work during the implementation of this event. My name is Nikea Jalynn Cook and I am the reigning Miss VACAPAF 2014. I recently won a pageant held by the men of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. At the end of April I will be representing the state of Virigina at the Eastern Region confrence in Baltimore Maryland, held by the fraternity.

Now as I am reaching the end of my reign I am soon to crown a new title holder, and I have been given the opportunity to represent Monticello in the Teen Arkansas USA scholarship pageant. This would give me a chance to further my platform of the Miracle League, as well as recieve a very prestigious scholarship. If I were to win I would represent the state of Arkansas in the Teen USA pageant. There are numerous life changing oppoortunities that could come with me competing in this organization. Now I just need your help, if I could have 50 people donate just $ 20.00 then I could reach my goal of $ 1000.00. Each contestant is required to pay a sponsorship fees totaling $ 1000.00.

As most of you know Jason and I coach competetive cheerleading, and happen to be getting married at the peak of our competition season, so we have decided to take our honeymoon in May after the season comes to an end. This will give us plenty of time to save so we can take a fabulous honeymoon. Thanks for you HELP!Hi, my name is Carlos and I met the love of my life in April 2010. The first day I met Erica I knew she was the one. I felt so comfortable around her that I felt I had known her for years. Erica and I met on the internet and when I saw her I thought she was one of the most beautiful women I had seen in my life. Erica is a burn survivor, she was in an accident when she was 5 years old. Dr\\'s gave her a 30% chance to live, they even suggested her parents bring in a priest to give her her final farewell. Through the odds, she fought through over 30 surgeries and is the beautiful, funny, loving, full of life women I fell in love with 4 years ago. Erica has always struggled with her scars and would never leave the house without long sleeves. I remind her everyday that she is beautiful no matter what.This woman has been my rock since day one, I lost my job a year into our relationship and she has held down our home since. She was the bread winner for most of our relationship until recently I finally found another job. Now I\\'m working my hardest to give Erica her dream wedding and make her feel as beautiful as I know she is. However,I know I can\\'t do this alone.Please help me give my future wife the wedding of her dreams. She has been through so much throughout her life I just want to give her the world. Thank you in advance for helping me make this dream a reality.To All Of Our FriendsMy twin Serena (blue) and I (white) 4 days oldWith my sister and Grandma - I am in the pink - my twin Serena is in purple and our older sister Morgana in blueWith my twin Serena (left) and older sister Morgana (center)Pictures of wedding will be posted as it goes along.You will be part of the events when you view the photos.____________________________________________________________I have not done something like this before. One of our twin grand-daughters whom the wife and I raised for 18 years along with her other twin sister and older sister is now getting married 14 June 2015 in Cheyenne WY. I feel that Grandma needs to go to this wedding. A lot of you know that I am retired and we live on a fixed income. I also have major medical issues with blood clots and this may be the last and only chance to see her that both grandma and I will have. This is going to be a VERY FORMAL Chinese Wedding and Athena wasvery upset when I mentioned that we might not be able to attend due to finances needed.I am starting this Go Fund Me Page in hopes that I might be able to have both Grandmother and Grand Daughter to share this memorable eI would like to THANK ALL who have donated so far and appreciate any sharing and forwarding of this information to help in obtaining our goal.God Bless All and Thank You for any help.Vernon J AndersonWe are pleased to announce our wedding ceremony, to take place next month in California. It will be a small event, so there are many that will be dearly missed. We will keep everyone updated with the most flattering photos. ;)The plan is to head to Italythis December, for an extended visit. This will give us a chance to celebrate with Giovanni\\'sfamily and friends, as well as give me the opportunity to meet them all for the first time. For those who don\\'t know, Giovanni moved to the US alone, so all of his family is in Italy. Only his parents will be attending the wedding here in the US.

The wedding is May25th!\"I get by with a little help from my friends\"- The BeatlesDo you believe in Love? Do you believe in Magic? Great! Then you believe in the love and magic that has been happening many lifetimes between Emily and I.I could never comprehend marriage, mostly because it was never accessible to me. And also because I have never met anyone quite like Emily. Regardless of all the laws recently passed that make it possible for me to marry her, I can\\'t imagine doing anything but marrying her. I want to stand in the company of our family and friends , look her in the eyes and say I do. Every cell in my body already wakes up each day with this proclamation.Though our wedding will be small, it will still take some finances to make it happen. I, of course, want to make it such a beautiful day for my future bride. Life has handed me some curve balls, with breaking two teeth in a week and the breaking down of my car that I find myself in need of some help.If you can help, I am forever grateful. I would like this to be something I can either pay back or pay forward. It is hard to ask for help, much less not allow myself to do something in return.Thank you in advance. If all you can give is Love and Blessings, those are more than welcomed. We can never have enough of that.\"Let us not be satisfied with just giving money. Money is not enough, money can be got, but they need your hearts to love them. So spread your love everywhere you go\" -Mother TeresaThank you. Thank you.

This coming year, March 8, 2014 they will be celebrating one year of marriage. Traditionally brides and grooms create a gift registry for guests to select items to give to the bride and groom. However, Terrell & Lindsay have decided to do something a little different. Both are law students and they will be taking the Bar Examination to become licensed lawyers in July 2014. In preparation for this examination, the pair will be taking a prep course beginning May 2014 and ending right before the exam. This course costs $3200/person. ($6400 for the both of them), and this fee is separate from the actual amount it costs to sit for the exam ($436 for the Exam & $500 for the Character & Fitness application to take the exam). Instead of creating a registry, Lindsay & Terrell would ask that you instead help fund their bar prep course. This would be such a blessing to them and any donation would be more than helpful and much appreciated. Terrell & Lindsay will be taking donations until midnight on Friday, April 1, 2014.To learn more about the Bar Exam, please see the below link. https://www.gabaradmissions.org/bar-examination-information To learn more about the Barbri prep course, please see the below link. http://www.barbri.com/students/thirdYear.html Thank you so much family and friends for your help!HELLO WORLD!Do you believe in love? Because i\\'ve got something to say about it, and it goes something like this...As you may know, after TEN YEARS, Scott and Saro are going to stop living in sin, and start sinning LEGALLY!The reception is set ~ JUNE 13th! and the honeymoon paid for!But you can still bless this union with a gift donation toward a NEW BED! Whether you are TEAM BUSINESS or TEAM PLEASURE, What better way for a new couple to start wedded bliss than with a good night\\'s sleep. Thanking you in advance of a good night\\'s sleep!~ Scott & SaroGuys, I know how this seems. I hate these things. However, Joel and I are in a bind. Despite planning our wedding on a shoestring budget, we have encountered some...roadblocks. I (Nessa) recently was sued by Capital One for a credit card that I defaulted on several years ago, I was taken to court and must now pay them monthly or have any future earnings and tax refunds garnished. I recently got a job, however the constand standing on concrete and physical nature of the job caused a serious tendon issue in my left foot which left me unable to put weight on it. My employers tried to be understanding but their patience was limited and I was let go. This happened after less than 2 weeks on the job. Adding to that I failed my last semester of classes which means I owe my college the tuition and the government the cost of the grants I was given for that session. Joel recently had the same thing happen but for him not only does he owe the school and the government, but also the VA for their financial assistance. On top of all of this we still have the alterations to pay for on the dresses for my sister\\'s wedding, the trip to and from Wisconsin, and of course our usual bills.So now we have no real way to continue to pay off the last few things for the wedding. Most of the big things are already taken care of. My dress is bought, his tux is rented and paid in full, the venue is paid for. We still need to pay our photographer, we need to pay for some of the basic food and drink, we need to pay for the PA system so there will be music, and alterations need to still be made to my dress. The only way to accomplish this would be to take out a small personal loan and plunge ourselves further into debt which is kind of the exact opposite thing that we wanted when we decided to get married. I still find this to be a frivolous use of this service. We aren\\'t dying, our bills will still be paid, we won\\'t lose our house. We just need a little help getting over the hump to make our day happen, to create memories with our family and friends. If you are like me, see things like this and roll your eyes to the sky and move on, Icompletely understand. I wouldn\\'t even be doing this if it hadn\\'t been suggested by numerous people and the idea supported by a close friend. If you can donate please do. If you can\\'t, that\\'s fine too. I would rather have you show up to the wedding with a smile on your face and a hug than pay money and resent me for asking this of you all.From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for even clicking the link to read this. Any funds we receive will go directly to wedding expenses. Any funds above and beyond what is needed to finish paying it off will go towards allowing us to get out of town and enjoy our freshly minted marriage and pay off a few bills.Hi World! :-)My name is Mark, and my big brother is getting married this summer (August). My mom and my baby sister would love to be able to see him get married, but we are strapped for cash. Recently, my mom had a really nasty fall that shattered her left arm. It disabledher from working, and as a widowed mother running a day-care out of her home while trying to make it on her late husbands pension, it has been rough. Since the accident, her income has diminished and it has been a struggle to get by. It has been slow getting new clients (children to watch) now that she is again able to work. She just told me today that shes been painting a neighbors fence with her good arm in order to get $50 a day. She is such an incredible woman, always putting others first and doing so with a smile. I wish I could help her, but as a recent college graduate staying with friends as I look for that next level job, I am unable to help and it breaks my heart. We would so appreciate some support so that my mother could fly down from Canada, where she lives, and see her son get married!! Thank you for considering this request! Every bit helps!MarkI am trying to fund a Dream Wedding for my fiance Racheal. Right now I\\'ve been unemployeed due so personal issues and she just took a huge pay cut to spend more time with the family. I feel like there is no way to give her the wedding she deserves. It\\'s really heart breaking to know you can never give the woman you love the wedding she deserves. This woman does so much for me and our son it\\'s insane. She works less than 10 hours a week since her new job isn\\'t hours guaranteed, she goes out of her way to make me and our son happy, and honestly I feel like she deserves so much more than a small justice of the peace wedding. I would love to fly her to Germany, my home country, for a honeymoon so she can meet my oma before she passes. I don\\'t even expect that. Honestly I\\'m not expecting much. I figured this would be a way to hopefully get her what she deserves. If I can get people to donate as little as 1 dollar, I feel her dream wedding could be within reach. If you feel like this is worth donating but can\\'t please share and lets see if we can make this happen for this amazing woman. thank you for even reading and considering this.This past year we were touched by a story of a local young man who has been battling brain cancer for 16  years. He recently proposed to his high school sweetheart, Jackie, who has been his rock through each up and down through Scottie\\'s battle for life. \"She\\'s loved me through chemo, through surgeries:she\\'s loved me for who I am, regardless of the fact that I have cancer,\" Scottie told us in a recent interview.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as we met Jackie and Scottie, we fell in love with them and their story, and wanted to do everything in our power to help them - help them have the wedding day of their dreams - help them with the financial burden of planning a wedding.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur company, Better Half Weddings & Events, Inc. decided to team up with Jackie and Scottie, offering our wedding planning services for free. Beyond that, we\\'ve vowed to help them find other local wedding professionals who would be interested in donating their services at no cost as well. The average wedding cost in South Florida is almost $35,000: After sharing their story through our social media, other vendors were as touched by their story as we were, and jumped on board to make this wedding dream a reality. Good portions of the wedding components have been covered, however, there are still many categories that need to be filled...where we need donations to make this wedding possible. They have faced enough financial burdens through all of Scottie\\'s treatments.\\n\\n\\n\\nJackie & Scottie are set to say \"I DO\" March 2013. This is where we need YOUR help! We are trying to spread the word across South Florida & BEYOND to not only gain donations from local wedding professionals, but also monetary contributions. There are many aspects that go into planning a wedding, so donations will fuel our goal of providing everything at no cost to the couple. We have set up a Wells Fargo bank account anyone can donate into [which I would be happy to provide more information when appropriate], and a donation email account [donate@betterhalfweddings.com], anyone can use to write us with questions or comments. We would be overjoyed if you were touched by this story enough to donate!!!\\n\\n\\n\\nWe created the following video to help spread the word about Jackie and Scottie\\'s story, as well as this wedding planning project, so would be thrilled if you could take the time to watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bahjMn5xK90. (Grab a tissue first!!)\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you so very much for taking the time to read this, & we can\\'t thank you enough for your generosity.Thank you for even considering helping us celebrate our special day! We (Chris & Javonni) are having our wedding on August 30, 2014 and have been trying to pay in cash (we don\\'t need more debt). We have already paid out $11,000 and we have $7,000 to go. We got married (by proxy) while Chris was deployed to Afghanistan but we never got to say our vows to each other and have our special moment. Since then we have faced illness (Chris had some heart issues), death (Chris\\'s Godsister died), and relocation (JaVonni moved from NC to FL). We stood strong and by each others side but then the major hiccup came. It took 4 weeks to get JaVonni\\'s nursing license transferred which completely threw off our schedule for earning the money to pay for our wedding. JaVonni\\'s license just came this week but she will not be able to start working until next week (technicalities with the company). Either way, it is not enough time to make $7,000. We really need your help! The remaining balances must be paid by August 14, 2014. Please cosider making a donation, no matter how great or how small to help us celerate our union and say our vows before God and family!Thank you and God bless!~Chris & JaVonniJason and Stephanie are getting married in May and are trying to raise money for their dream honeymoon . These two love birds have been together for over four years and are looking forward to their future together. The both of them are hard working and are looking for some down time together. They are not asking for wedding gifts, as they already have so much together. So let this be their gift from you.Kris and I are getting married! For me, it\\'s a second chance at love. For Kris, it\\'s an exciting first marriage. For both of us, it\\'s a new beginning and a dream come true. You see, both of us are in our 40s and both of us had written off the notion of finding love again. The thing is, we both have big hearts and a ton of empathy to go around. Those of us born with that affliction tend to gravitate toward nonlucrative careers. Naturally, we both work for a nonprofit organization called Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles (spcaLA). In fact that\\'s where we met. We were both volunteers with the organization and were subsequently hired one month apart. Kris is a behavior and training specialist whose responsibities include the training, enrichment, socialization, and mental/emotional well-being of the animals that enter our shelters. I\\'m a humane educator. I hold anti-violence, empathy-based programs for adolescents at schools in at-risk environments. One of these programs is a court mandated weekend juvenile delinquent program for youths who have commited acts of animal cruelty. Another one is a middle school elective course on Humane Education with a dog training component where students learn to train dogs, using only positive methods. I am not telling you this to bore you, but to let you know that although my job is deeply rewarding, it comes with a nonprofit salary. All my jobs seem to have this issue. Before this, I was a social worker for disabled adults, and, before that, a middle school teacher.Kris and I live paycheck to paycheck with our three dogs and whatever animals we are fostering at the time. We know a lot of good people that are helping us with our small wedding. We have also been doing our best to save all we can. With some creative planning, we are getting closer to reaching our wedding goals. However, at this time, a honeymoon is out of the question.We are requesting help in our wedding funding shortfalls and a nice, relaxing honeymoon. (We are secretly really really excited at the thought of an all-incluse resort near a tropical beach). Neither of us have been able to fund a vacation destination in years.We are graciously thanking you in advance for any help we receive, and our hope is that we can pay this forward someday.Hi family and friends, since we have lived together for nearly 4years, we don\\'t have a need for many registry items. Instead, we would like for our loved ones to just help us go on ahoneymoon.  We would like to spend 5-6 days in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic at the All-Inclusive Resort,Majestic Colonial - Punta Cana.We are getting married!   Can\\'t wait for our big day! In leiu this HUGE time of our life, we would like to ask for monetary gifts rather than material gifts. We are looking for our new home togther and this would be most helpful in starting our marriage off on the right foot. If you will not be able to attend the wedding in Orange County, California on January 10th and would like to give agift, you may do so through our GoFundMe account or contact us for other means of doing so. Thank you to everyone who has supported us individually and as a couple so far. We love you all and look forward to continuing to share our lives with you in the future.This september marks 50 years since Bob and Marie got married and we think it\\'s time they had theirhoneymoon!Over the last 50 years they have blessed many lives including us, their children. If they have touched your lives and you are able to, please help us give themthe honeymoon they never had! Any amount will be greatly appreciated! Thank you! We can do it! Here is a link to the facebook page if you would like to leave any message for them. Bob&Marie\\'s Facebook Any message left on gofundmeor facebook will be delivered to them on thier anniversary.As we all know.. Weddings can get expensive, and who wants to go in debt before they start their marriage? Not us, haha! We just thought we would create this page for kicks to see what would happen. We don\\'t want anyone to feel obligated, but if you would love to bless us with contributing to our wedding fund, we would so deeply appreciate it. Between the two of us we are on a limited budget of what we can pull off for the wedding and thought we would give this thing a try. Every little bit will help! :) Thanks so much for taking the time to even read this. Here\\'s a video of us performing a song we wrote together titled, \"Have My Heart.\" We wrote it the first day we met each other. Never have we experienced anything like that before. Little did we know, our little love song would actually become our reality. Love, George & StephanieHey Everyone! Shane and I are super excited that we are down to the wire with our upcoming wedding! More importantly, we\\'re super excited to begin our lives together as husband and wife. Where we are thankful for all the good wishes, positive vibes, and overwhelming support, we are also faced with the realization of rsvp\\'s. The cost is fastly adding and we are on our own in this. Yes, I realize that we\\'re adults and it is our choice to have a wedding, but we are both sure that it it\\'s our final wedding and wish it to be special. We know really, all we need is us, a witness, a license, and someone ordained to perform the ceremony, but it\\'s also about celebrating our union with our family and friends, and being recognized as husband and wife. We\\'re having to cut some serious corners so please know that your donation is helpful in many ways. We\\'re kind of thinking that the honeymoon probably isn\\'t going to happen right now, so our focus is raising our five kids, providing a home and full bellys, and caring and catering for one another. I mean, that IS what a marriage is about, right? So please, show your support in a way that builds a future for us. Help us start our marriage out with our vows, our party, our family, and friends.. not so much the stress that naturally comes with the planning of it. We\\'d like each of you to know that with this reaching you, it means that you\\'re very special to us. Thanks again in advance, and please raise your glasses to Shane and Amy May.. in a few short weeks! Donate & Celebrate!!Hi everyone! As you know, on November 22, 2014, I am marrying my best friend and the love of my life! We have been dreaming of a beautiful honeymoon in a far away exotic place! This isa dream come true for usand Aaron and I are so excited this trip!In lieu of the traditional wedding gifts, Aaron and I would like to ask you to help us enjoy the Honeymoonof a Lifetime.We are flying to the beautiful island of Antigua and will be enjoying a seven day honeymoon at Sandals Grand Antigua. As this is an all inclusive resort, there are many things we would love to do as well. With your wedding gifts, we will be able to go on the sunset cruise, enjoy a relaxing couples massage on the beach and snorkling trips......sounds amazing, doesn\\'t it!!\\nWe are so grateful and appreciative of your gifts, helping Aaron and I go on our dream honeymoon.We are looking forward to seeing all of you on our wedding day!With much love -Sarah and AaronWho are we?We are Amber Sorensen and Dexter Tapahe from Provo, UT. We are getting married August 1st, 2015 and want to raise money to survive our first few months of being married!Why are we raising money?Dexter recently lost his job and is working on getting a new one (PRONTO) and we need all the help we can get to make sure we can transition smoothly into married life! This was going to be for our honeymoon but paying the bills is much more important!Thank you to any and all who donate!Our Story: (By Amber)How many people can say they\\'ve loved their fiance(e) for more than a decade before they got engaged? It sounds like something straight out of a fairy tale (or a sitcom), right?For us, that\\'s exactly what happened.Dexter and I grew up in the same neighborhood, just a few houses apart. On a warm sunday evening in the summer of 2004 we were out for a walk when we both quietly realized we felt something beyond friendship for one another. We fell in love.The ten years that followed were rife with drama-- dating and breakups and secret holiday kisses. In spite of all the ups and downs we never stopped caring deeply for one another, even if we weren\\'t talking for a time.As we grew older we went our separate ways but fate wasn\\'t done with us yet:In 2014 I moved into a new apartment just a few streets aways from where Dexter was living (though we didn\\'t know it at the time). My first morning in the new city I was in a car accident. Having no friends or even aquaintances in the area, I called Dexter, who rescued me from a frigid and lonely parking lot. The next night, I invited him over to watch a movie and gave him the choice of what we were to watch. He (of course) chose one guaranteed to make me cry (and therefore need consoling and cuddles). Over the next few weeks, we rekindled our friendship and it quickly grew into something more. It didn\\'t take long for us to realize we wanted to be together forever. On a cold evening in December, Dexter proposed to me in my home with my family. I said yes, and, come August 1st, we will spend the rest of our lives together like we always wanted to.While building our happy home we realized that we have two of everything. So in lieu of registering for gifts, we are asking for monetary assistance with our wedding & honeymoon expenses. You can contribute however much you like. Thank you for helping us celebrate this momentous time in our lives.Hello Family and Friends!As you know, we recently got engaged while in Bali! We have heard rumors that people are wanting to give us engagement/wedding gifts and there is only one thing we really want.... our first home and to renovate it!Since we don\\'t know where we want to live long term, we have decided that our first home must be on wheels! Yep, thats right! We want to purchase an RVthat we can take on the road and park in beautiful places around the country!Our plan is to travel and promote Jewel and Lotus and Salila Rising; to spread the word, get in shops and connect with amazing people and places!

Shaun and Lauren Leonard are childhood sweethearts who\\'s dream was to one day get married and have two children. God answered their prayers. On April 15, 2011 they were married. The next year on April 9, 2012 God blessed them with thier first child, a cute son named Anthony. The following year on July 25, 2013 God blessed them with a beautiful daughter nameTapree. They felt their family was complete, decided to take precaution, donated and gave everything away including cribs, basinet, clothes, monitors, etc...October of last year 2014, Lauren sensed something was wrong with her body and went to the hospital. To her surprise she found out she was pregnant. Two months later, even more surprised to find out she was pregnant with twins. They are due to have twin boys July 3, 2015. By the time the twins are born, there will be 4 babies 3 and under. They need to buy a van that would fit 4 car seats. The current car can only fit 2.Would you be so kind to help them raise funds toward a van to fit all their blessings? Anthony age 3, Tapree 1, Baby A, and Baby B.Any size donation would be appreciated. All donations are gong towrds a van. Thank you so much for your kindness and God bless you all.Hello! My name is Asia and this is my fiance Zach. We are getting married in June of 2015! :D We could not be more excited, terrified, or blessed to be starting this new journey together. Our story began about 2 years ago when Zach and I both stayed on the campus at Rochester College over the summer as student workers. He worked on the housekeeping crew and I worked on the grounds crew. So most of our encounters were in passing and just consisted of passing hello\\'s or small talk about work or weather. As the summer went on we saw each other around more and he bagan to pursue spending time with me. At first I didn\\'t realize that he was trying to date me, I just thought he wanted to be friends; so one day he had to sit me down and tell me what was going on. This led to a couple more months of long walks and talks as Zach patiently waited for me. As a result of all our time outside nature and God have become the things that brought us together and it is where we are most happy. Therefore we are having and outdoor/barn wedding in June. My dream has always been to have a simple county, vintage wedding with family and friends and good food. I have a beautiful dress but I can\\'t give any details aways ;). My bridesmaids are wearing flower print sundresses of their choosing with cowboy boots and the groomsem are wearing khaki\\'s with a white button up and suspenders and cowboy boots. Zach and I are both easy going people and we get by on very little (being two newly graduate college students). We struggle to make it from month to month but God always provides us with what we need. All we want it to be able to make our day special (which to us means being able to pay for the basics without going flat broke ;)). We hope that this day will be simple, with lots of love, laughter, and fun. After the wedding festivities we hope to head up to Mackinac City to do some camping, hiking and site seeing. Like I said before, we love being outdoors!! It is what makes our souls happy and it will be the perfect way for us to start our new life together. In order to make that happen we are asking for your help by supporting us monetarily. Whether you can give us $1 or $100 it will mean the world to us!Brett and I have been blessed with almost six years of time together. We have already accumulated all things that most couple would register for in their wedding registry. So, we ask that you contribute towards our \"honeymoon fund\" as a gift if you so choose to. Thank you in advance for all the love and support.hi everyone, i am hoping people could support me in raising money for my wedding. my fianc and i had planned on getting married in august 2014 but within the past few months i decided we should move the wedding to around may. i decided this because i simply want my father to walk me down  the aisle at my wedding and to give me away. what little girl doesn\\'t dream of this? my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer almost 3 years ago so he has already beat the odds. my dad has been hospitalized a lot in the past few months and he is not getting better. all i want is for my dad to be able to walk his only daughter down the aisle at my wedding. my fianc and i are using our tax money to pay for our wedding and so i cannot put a deposit down for a dress or the venue until we get the money. i want to move the wedding date to as soon as i possibly can without doing a justice of the peace or something like that but i need help paying for those things as soon as possible to make sure my dad can walk me down the aisle. thank you.We are getting married! And honestly, we are already filled to capacity with stuff. Books, games, cabinets overflowing with kitchware. So we\\'d like any gifts you decide to give be something we can convert to an experience, one that will live on in the form of memories, photos, and tall tales. Jessie and I have always wanted to visit Ireland, so we are hoping you\\'ll help us make that happen next year!We are so blessed to have found the love of a lifetime, and we are going to finally make it real (at least in the eyes of the law---you shoud be laughing!). From where ever our lives hadtaken us, we have found ourselves ona newpath together. Our broken roads have truly been blessed (there is probably a country song about this, lol).No matter where we came from, we have chosento spend the rest ofour lives together.We have built our dream wedding, and we want to share itwith those that have been so instumental in making us who we are as individuals. There is nothing we need in life that we cannot accomplish or gain together; and for that we are so thankful. And because we are so blessed, we are asking that our family and friends don\\'t shop or stress over a wedding gift. The best thing that each of you could do for us, is come to Mexico and share in our day, and then continue to share in our life. (Besides, you have been meaning to take a vacation!)We do realize though, that not everyone will be willing or able to travel, but we would still like for you to be a part of our day, and a part of our lives. With that said, to eliminate the frustration of the \"wedding gift,\" we would appreciate your contribution to our wedding and honeymoon fund. Please do not feel obligated, we just thank you for being there with us, and we look forward to sharing our joy.Love Ted and KelDear Family & Friends, Joe and I decided to crowdfund our honeymoon cruise to Baja Mexico as an alternative to the traditional wedding registry. With your financial gift, we can upgrade our stateroom or use the funds to pay for excursions like riding ATVs, horseback riding, sightseeing, massages, dinner on the beach and more. Thank you so much for your generosity in advance. We look forward to seeing you at the Wedding!Love, Christine & JoeMatt and Tiffany are finally getting hitched May 2nd, 2015!!! I have setup a wishing well for them since they have decided not to register anywhere. Any donation is a blessing!!! (All donations are strictly for Matt and Tiffany)Two countries. One love.By now, many of you know that Im about to get married! But, what many of you might not know is the love story behind it! In February of 2013 I happened upon a drunken, boisterous Englishman spouting on and on about King Richard III and after weeks of playing hard to get, getting to know one another, meeting in between studying and work, and one spectacular birthday Beer Cake we fell in love. We knew that it was something special. Unfortunately, love isnt always easy, but its always worth it. My work visa fell through and I was back in the States, but without the man I love. Ben, who is terrified of planes, made the trip to the US to visit me, not once but TWICE. In April, as many of you know, he proposed with the beautiful picturesque Portland Headlight lighthouse in the background. This is the love story many of you knowNow were asking for your help to be part of our love story. In order to be together we applied for a K-1 Visa and his interview is in a week! We are in the process of coming up with enough money to purchase a plane ticket for Ben to fly over here and the green card so that we can start our life together and give this love story a happy ending. So, Im asking for your help. For you to be part of our love story. For you to help us show that love conquers even 2000 miles of the Atlantic Ocean and two countries. Any little bit helps! Your generous gift will allow me and my fiance to be together finally after so many months apart and being able to start our own American dream. Please dont feel obligated to donate, but if you do  please know that I will always be grateful and you will have a part in our love story. Consider it an early wedding gift.English:\\n\\nErin\\'s brother is getting married in Octoberand we want to be there!

Please help us help Brad!!!!!If you\\'re here, then you probably know that we are getting married!\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s right, in early July, we are having an adorable little ceremony (at least, we hope it\\'s going to be adorable!), and then shortly afterward, we\\'ll head to Burning Man, for our annual work-acation. Since we\\'ve been living in delicious sin for a few years now, we don\\'t really need any of the typical things you\\'d find on a wedding registry--we\\'re set in the linens and towels and kitchen appliances departments, thankyouverymuch. What we DO need, however, is a holiday. A proper holiday. A holiday where we don\\'t work in the lanes or camp out in a tent (not that there\\'s anything wrong with tent camping. It is known). And that\\'s where you come in!\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can help send us on a proper honeymoon!\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead of getting us gifts, we\\'re kindly asking for you to help us on our honeymoon adventure. We\\'re not sure where we\\'ll go yet, since a big part of that depends on how close to our goal we\\'re able to get. What we DO know is that we\\'d like to go somewhere warm, we\\'d like to go somewhere we\\'ve never been before, and we\\'d like to go for about 2 weeks. If all our friends and family chip in, even just a little bit, we know we can find our way through the looking glass and off onto a grand adventure indeed!Since Cody and I have little need for many household items, we\\'re just asking our friends and family who don\\'t know what to get us to donate. We figure this is easier than gift cards! Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll still register like regular couples do... but this is what we really need.My name is Ric Jackson. I was born and raised in Detroit, MI. I\\'ve spent the last 13+ years in the Marine Corps. Just over three years ago I met, the love of my life, Aisha Tatum. She is, without a doubt, my best friend and I could not see myself without her. When I get wound up, she\\'s the anchor that keeps me grounded. She is my rock and my stability. She deserves the entire world on a platter. She deserves so much more than I can give. Unfortunately I was discharged from the Marines over a year ago. Though honorably discharged, I was no longer considered for retention. What I plan to do with the funds raised is give my angel the absolute best wedding she deserves followed by the dream vacation to wherever she desires. Please help me in my endeavours. Any further assistance would be greatly appreciated!As we don\\'t need many household items, we\\'d really appreciate any donations toward our honeymoon in Cabo.... thank you for anything you can contribute.  We\\'re really looking forward to starting our life together laying on the beach at an all inclusive resort.'),\n",

       "  'December 1st marked my 5th month with the ministry. Since September, we have been to 9 different states and have done over 30 events. During these events our speaker, Justin Fatica, brings the message of hope and God\\'s love. We focus on the pain and suffering; the one thing we have in common is our pain and our suffering. We invite the youth to see the pain that others are going through and that they are not alone. During the Catholic/Christian events we also have Prayer Ministry, where we pray with the people who need prayer and give them encouragement. Being with this ministry has shown me that sharing my story, no matter how uncomfortable I feel, will always help someone else. Through HAN we will be able to touch 300,000 lives with the Gospel this year. Some might wonder why this is needed, but the reality is, we live in a world where our youth are lost and have forgotten about Gods love and endless mercy for us. So many struggle with issues like depression, physical/sexual abuse, addictions and they feel as though they have nowhere or no one to turn to. They fail to realize, usually because they have not been taught, that God is there with open arms ready to heal us from our past and our failures and make us new. I, myself, struggled with my own issues and had a beautiful encounter with God that began a real conversion in my life. I hope to reach others and let them know God can do even more than what they imagine when they open up their hearts. Our key program is Follow Up, which is done back at the office in Syracuse, NY. Two weeks after an event, we reach out to the kids who signed up for follow up, see how they are doing and walk them through the 8 step program to Win it All. Some of these steps are recognizing your importance, discovering your mission, making your mess a message, among others. In order to be a missionary I have to fundraise minimum $8,000. I have reached half of that goal, I currently have about $4,400 (gofundme deducts a good amount from the donations). Our mean of transportation is by our You\\'re Amazing Tour bus which we drive to every event we go to. The money goes towards gas, food, and travel expenses while on the road and for housing while in Syracuse. I am begging for prayers and monetary donations. Whatever you can give, no matter how small, please do not hesitate. The Lord will bless you in abundance. Hard as Nails is a 501c nonprofit organization, any donation is tax deductible. If you would like to donate please send cash/check/money order to Hard as Nails Ministries P.O.

I am Ruben Townsend, Minister In-Charge of the Feeding Ministry of the Fountain of Faith Christian Assembly, 515 S.W. 6th Street in Oklahoma City, Okla. 73109. We call our Feeding Ministry the \"Breakfast Club\", which is very dear to our hearts, as we have witnessed, and continue to witness the Mighty Hand of God moving on so many levels and in so many areas of the lives of our friends on the street whom we serve, as well as the lives of the 25 or more dedicated members who faithfully serve in the ministry. \\n\\nI don\\'t mean to be lengthy, but I have to share the \"Empty Pot Miracles\" that many of our brothers and sisters have witnessed, I have witnessed this on more than occasion over the years, Praise God. As members, we all serve in some capacity in the Breakfast Club, we wake up at 5 am or earlier, every Sunday morning to serve our friends on the streets. We are blessed to have as many as 35 people who serve on a given Sunday morning... It\\'s a Calling. The \"Empty Pot Miracle takes place as the one serving looks down the line and clearly sees there may be 12 people in line waiting to be served, while the server is looking at an \"empty pot\", but the pot will miraculusly deliver its content until the last person is served. \\n\\nPastor P.B. Townsend, my father who is Head Pastor of the Fountain of Faith, took on the God-Given Responsibility of feeding and clothing our friends on the streets. He was given the Mantle on the Deathbed of the Founder of the Feeding Ministry, brother John Worth, who started feeding people out of the back of his pick up truck at 4 am, riddled with cancer and his 14 year old daughter, out on the streets on the coldest mornings, serving his hungry friends with the best that he had. For 30 years, the Feeding Ministry of the Fountain of Faith Christian Assembly has Never Missed Feeding One Meal. That is the Power of God. \\n\\nThe Lord has sent many faithful servants over the years and I have been very blessed and honored to have taken the helm of the Feed Ministry for the last 10 years. All Glory and Honor goes to the Only True and the Living God that we serve. This could not be what it is without the loving, faithful, and obedient hearts of the ones who sacrifice early every Sunday morning to go out of their way to help their friends. Now, we are asking for your help. Please remember the Breakfast Club in your prayers as well as your gifts. Thank you. May the Lord Bless You Richly. RubenGod has called Servant Leader Kevin A.

Hehas called me to New Zealand!!! 2013I was a successful pediatric speech pathologist and faithful children\\'s ministry leader at Love on Fire Churchwith a tugging sense that I needed to change my life. In December 2013 my world was rocked! I gave complete control ofmy life to God, accepted my calling as a prophet and went on a 1 year tv-fast! I was all in! The next week my husband moved outand soon after filed for divorce. In the following months God guided me to sell my house, give notice atmy job, and apply to Laidlaw Collegein New Zealand for their Bachelor of Ministries program!!! I wanted God to change my life, but I had no idea that meant I was going to loose all in which I previously found security. But that\\'s how God does it! He is my security now!! I am in the process of shutting down the life I created and moving into the one God has called me to live! That means I will be moving in December 2014 (yes, ironic....one year after I started my tv-fast!) to New Zealand for two years and serve the Lord while attending school. \\n\\nYour financial support will pay for my tuition and school fees.God repeatedly tells me to not worry about the money! All He asks is that I share my testimony! So I thank Him forputting it on your heart to give, and I thank you for your obedience!!

With your help we can still reach our goal!Many people have asked me when I would release a new musical project, because YOUR WILL, has blessed so many. I have told them that until I do what God has told me to do, that project will have to wait.For those who want to assist us in replacing our roof, I am going to commit to recording that next musical project upon the completion of this assignment God has given me...........The 1st 1000 people that make a tax deductible donation of $20 or more (it can be $50, $100, $1000 or whatever the Lord puts on your heart) will be the 1st to receive an autographed copy of my new cd, straight off the presses, before the release concert.

Kitchener StreetWestchester, IL 60154Hey\\nguys! My name is Charity and I am working to use my \"time, talents and\\ntreasure\" to share the gospel of Christ through Youth With A Mission.   I have been involved with YWAM for a year\\nnow and have been impressed with both their hearts and stewardship. I\\'ve\\nalways had a passion for people and for sharing the Good News that Jesus\\nlovingly came down and died for us. For the last year I have been praying about\\nwhat God wants my next step to be after graduating high school. After a lot of\\nprayer and seeking the Lord, I felt Him guiding me to go on a DTS (Discipleship\\ntraining school) with YWAM.After\\nmore prayer I came to the conclusion that I was being led to enter the DTS at\\nthe YWAM base in Lakside, Montana. It is five month long program.  The first three months of training in Montana\\nis focused on developing the disciplines and skills for mission work. It\\nincludes daily group worship time, cultural training, time in our focus tracks\\nto develop our gifts and passions, exploring foundational discipleship topics,\\nand growing together as a team as we grown closer to God. The two months\\nfollowing will consist of a foreign missions outreach, where we will be sent to\\na different part of the world and passionately share our love for God and the\\ngospel, through the skills and tracks we were taught in our three month\\ntraining. I am\\neager to see how God not only grows me, but also how he grows my teammates as\\nHe uses us for His glory! My desire is to be used to help others develop their\\nown journey\\'s with Christ. That\\'s\\nwhy I\\'m inviting you to be a part of this experience : part of my missionary\\njourney and the journeys of those we will be ministering to. More than\\nanything, I ask for your prayer. Please take a moment to write my name down and\\nput it on your refrigerator or in your Bible as a reminder. I\\'d ask that you\\npray for:       \\nSafety \" for the team       \\nReceptive Hearts \" for\\nthose we will be ministering to       \\nImpact \" upon the lives of\\neveryone we come in contact with       \\nProvision \" that I would be\\nable to raise the money needed for training        \\nDirection \" that God would\\nshow me the steps He has for me beyond the DTSIf you\\nfeel led, I would also invite you to participate with me financially and allow\\nyour giving to have impact through my efforts and that of my team. \\nI\\'m psyched to see God do amazing things and I cant wait\\nto post update videos with amazing stories of His greatness! Thank you for your\\nprayers, love, and support. \\n\\nGod Bless,\\nCharity\\nIsaiah 6:8 \"Also I heard the voices of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.\"Hello!This campaign is to fund assisted care personnel for my parents, Dick and Kathy Sherman, so they can remain together and in their own home. They need assisted care in their home. Here\\'s their story.Dad and Mom have been married for nearly 64 years. When they first married, Dad entered youth ministry when he was 21 (with Youth for Christ in Toledo, OH) and they later moved to the Bay Area (San Jose, CA) where he was the Tri-County YFC director in the late 50s-early 60s. Dad then became a youth minister at The Valley Church in Cupertino, CA, where he stayed until the early 70s, and where he directed the high school and college kids in \"You\\'re A Good Man, Charlie Brown,\" which toured up and down California. He helped start a new church, The West Valley Bible Fellowship, in the early 70s, and he pastored that church until 1985, when it closed its doors. It was at Valley that Dad first heard about Francis Schaeffer, and then at the Fellowship where he wrote the study guides to two of Schaeffer\\'s films (Reclaiming the World and The Great Evangelical Disaster). After the Fellowship, Dad went to work for Orchard Supply Hardware in corporate training, and he stayed with them until he retired in 1997. Throughout this time, Mom was the consummate wife and homemaker, making sure us kids were where we needed to be and on time, cooking meals, keeping the house running smoothly, etc. She was always there for us when we needed her.During all that time, Dad and Mom cared and provided for a growing family (5 children). All the years he was in the ministry, Dad never had any retirement set aside. When he was pastor of the Fellowship, he also ran a landscaping business on the side to make ends meet, especially during the lean times when the Fellowship was out of money. During all those years, we never heard Dad or Mom complain about money or the lack thereof. They just made do with what they had; and we always had food on the table and good clothes for school and church. It was part of their Iowa and Great Depression upbringing that enabled them to take what they had and make it last and make it work.Well, now it\\'s time for us kids to pay them back. Over the last several years, Mom has developed dementia and she is now in need of 24/7 care. Dad can\\'t do it all. He has tried, but it is too much work. He also recently had rotator cuff surgery on his left shoulder, so he will be in recuperation for at least 6 months. My brother Tim and one of my sisters, Melodee, have been tag-team staying with them, caring for them, but they are both worn out also, and they have their own families. We (my siblings--Patty, Melodee, Tim, Becky, and I) need to bring in professional care-givers who can assist with the daily needs of living. Dad and Mom vowed to each other that they would be cared for at home until they repose. Mom, Dad, and I are Orthodox, which means that we know that all that happens to us is for our salvation and benefit. We trust in the Lord and look forward to our going home to Him. Our knowledge and faith, however, don\\'t pay the bills. We must do that. So, I, the youngest of the five kids, am appealing to you to give a little bit so that Mom and Dad, Dick and Kathy Sherman, can remain together in their little home in Scio, OR, and can live in dignity together. Whatever amount you can give will go entirely to their care. I will not take a dime. All funds will be used to pay for professional care-givers to attend to my parents\\' needs. Although I don\\'t think we would ever raise a million dollars, should that happen, any funds in excess of providing the needed assisted-care for my parents would be donated to Alzheimer\\'s research and/or a similar family in need.Thank you, and may God bless you for your almsgiving.For all of you who have taken the time and made the effort to serve with us at All Souls, we are asking for your help again. This holiday season, we are serving more guests than ever. We give them a hot meal served with love and dignity, but they also need the outreach and social services. We want to expand the services we offer, and you can help. We have the chance to get a matching grant to expand our outreach services for our guests. With your help, raising $5,000 can turn into $10K and get our guests the help they desperately need. Anything you can give will help. Please forward this to anyone on your list who knows about the good work we do.  They can also visit mondaynighthospitality.org to see more of our program in action. Thank you in advance!

He was brutally taken from me at the young and tender age of 17 days old while I was having emergency surgery. I didn\\'t think I was even able to have kids and the Lord blessed me with my bundle of joy. Little Christian was the light of my life. The short time he was here, he touched so many lives.....before, during and even after his death.Because he was so young, life insurance was not in my thoughts because I would have never thought I would lose him so soon. So now I have to incur funeral arrangements expenses and also other bills and expenses. I never thought that I would have to plan the funeral of my first and only child at this stage in his life.....or even ever.The things that I have to come out of pocket to pay will be to transport him to funeral home, post austopsy care, embalment, Coroner\\'s pouch, casket, burial plot and other things that go along with having a funeral.

Who will help fund this mission which is impacting so many people all over the country?Donate today!Hello!!!First, I want to just say thank you for taking the time to read this. My prayer is that God is hand-picking every person, that he desires, to read this. Right now my life consists of working, and preparing for the next season of life.I just graduated high school in January, and I will be working at Hume Lake Christian Camps this summer. I have dreamed about traveling and having new experiences for years, all with hope that I would have the opportunity to be surrounded by an uplifting community. Now, I am able to see that God is granting me the desires of my heart with the intention of knowing him in a deeper way. I have been accepted into YWAM\\'s (Youth With a Mission) discipleship training school in Kona, Hawaii! The program is split into two phases: lecture phase and outreach.LECTURE PHASE:On September 25th I will venture to Kona, Hawaii to spend three months dedicating my heart and time to knowing God deeper. For those three months, I will become equipped to love the community I am surrounded with by understanding who they are. The focus for this time is to see God move and transform each of our lives by fixating our thoughts and desires on him and growing a deeper understanding of who he is. In order to expand this understanding, we will attend classes daily, where we will dive into the Bible, listen to various speakers, and engage in worship through singing and prayer. We will learn what it means to abide in him and how to be a transformed community. As we begin to seek him, our purpose will be focused on reaching the broken, the lost, the weary, and the lonely. I believe that the simplicity of the gospel has the power to change lives and bring life to where only death remains. This training will equip us to bring relief where there is a need.OUTREACH:The locations for the outreach will be chosen within the first few weeks of the lecture phase. Some examples as to where I could be going are South Africa, Cambodia, the Middle East, Fiji, Spain, or Ireland. In each place the need is different. As a team, our hearts are set on knowing God and making him known. God has given me a heart for the broken. I am looking forward to allowing him to let me act as His hands and feet as he does healing. This is a season of him leading me into a ministry where His heart is at the center. There are far more unknowns than knowns, and because of that I am looking forward to see God show up through my lack of expectations.I know that more than anything, he has designed my life to be done with a body of people. You are that body. I have no faith that I can do any journey alone. The desire of my heart is that you would be willing toplay the role of a hand or a foot or an ear as God wants to use you in this journey too.Ultimately I ask that you will partner with me in prayer. If you feel lead to give financially, I just want to say thank you in advance, and if you are unable to, please join my team by sharing my story with your friends and family.Thank you!!-Reigha***This is Revival  the turning of our hearts to God, with a desire to glorify him with all of our lives.***Many of us want what is best for humanity around the world.

HarrisOUR INTER-CONNECTION IS THE KEY        Effective networks are the key to effective human interaction. Networks, not \"networking\" are what I\\'m referring to. Our interconnectedness is a fact. How we utilize that is up to us. I believe that \"God\\'s Work in Progress\" (tm) has been called by God to build a network. How about 10 million Christ Followers, going to work every day, in business, government, and education, impacting their work, what they do, and how well they do it.?. Imagine them helping people to grow and thrive and flourish, and ....TO KNOW JESUS by giving to their co-workers and followers in this way:A demonstration that is an invitation. What if these millions introduced Jesus through their work and in relationship at work where they see these people every day?This type of netwwork would be a critical mass that would transform the marketplace in America, and from there, te world.How Do We Achieve This?To achieve this goal we need to build another type of network. A Radio Network. We want to distribute our program to the top 50 population centers in the U.S. on the best Christian Radio Stations in those markets. If you and I accomplish this, we can reach a potential 150,000,000 listeners and find 10 million Christians, among them who can impact the rest. A doable, necessary goal if we truly want Christ to be truly relevant. True networking is the key. Gods Work in Progress will link people together to bring love, real effectiveness and improvement, and God knows we need those. God wants a marketplace that is full and satisfying to Him and us. It is the redemption of the system, to make ALL things new. To equip, to train, to motivate, to inspire, and to love people in the place where the majority of their waking life is spent. Indeed, Jesus said we would do greater works, and this is a greater work. He prayed for unity in his last hours, before he was crucified. And now he is revealing that WORK is a unifier. We all work, it is one of the MAIN activities we have in common. We are all created to work. Will you help us now? This is a big goal and will take BIG resources. To help us to help the Church in its calling to save the world, we can do our part by saving the Marketplace. The Church, you and I, being light and salt, can reveal Jesus to a fallen world. Each $10,000 we raise equals a new station in the network. Friends, at this year-end I pray that God is already bringing the people he has prepared in advance to fund our growth (Eph 2:10) But even now, as a fledgling ministry, only 18 months old, we are in serious need of financing in the short term. Some of you have been stirred enough by the value of what we have been speaking these last 65 shows, and have committed to giving for 6 months. We are believing God to stir 100 people to give a monthly gift to our ministry over six months. (You can share this newsletter and make that 1000 people if you include a personal endorsement) You can clickHEREand give right now.Barbara and I are going through the pain of the birth of this ministry. Some days it\\'s easier than others. But we do that which our hands have been given to do with all of hearts, as unto to the Lord. We focus on the work, on doing great work with great faith. We are blessed by a great church body, who love us and we have a great \"growing\" (next May our first grandchild) family. And we have God...who loves us beyond measure, who gave his life as a gift, freely given for each of our benefit and for the sins of the whole world.      \\n\\nHere\\'s how you can help.1.

If you dont know what YWAM stands for or means, it stands for Youth With A Mission. YWAM trains students for three months and then sends them out on an outreach in another country, for three more months. DTS stands for Discipleship Training School. I will be training in Heidebeek, The Netherlands for the first three months.    While at the DTS I will be learning more of whom God is and growing closer in my own relationship with Him. I will also learn how to share the Gospel through mission work and evangelism. After the lecture phase (DTS; first three months) YWAM will send all the students out into smaller groups to another location, which is still unknown. This phase is called the outreach phase and is for three months. The three months of outreach will be lots of traveling, evangelizing, giving aid to those in need, and helping not only their physical needs but more importantly their spiritual needs.    During these six months overseas, I will experience incredible opportunities and my life will be forever changed! Im getting excited, yet scared as the time draws nearer. I know that this is what God had planned for me even before I knew what YWAM was. God has put missions on my heart and to help His people. Through this trip I can better learn how to do what He called us all to do, Go and make disciples. I also chose the Mercy and Justice DTS because my heart hurts for people that have been put in unjust situations and for those that never got a fair chance. I want to bless others through my blessings.    I hope that you see what God is doing in my life. I am so thankful to the people in my life who have helped me grow as a person and as a child of God. Even when I didnt know it, He was working in me. I would like to ask you for your support in prayer and if you have the means, financially. I will need close to 8,000 dollars for the entire trip. I realize that I have a big task at hand to raise the money, but I know God will provide. Thank you for taking the time to read this and all that you have invested into me.                                   With Love,                                  KelliAnn SterrettThe following is a breakdown of the total cost of my trip:Plane ticket to The Netherlands: $1,200Plane ticket home: $1,200Lecture Phase: $2,553Outreach Phase: $1,283Food on weekends: $300Bike rental for 3 months (this will be my transportation during the lecture phase): $64Money for unexpected needs and spending money: $200 a monthHello!

Short, sweet, and straight to the point: I am moving to England in September as an intern and full-time missionary with the House of Prayer, Europe. It\\'s still completely crazy to see myself type those words, and I can hardly even believe it\\'s true.If you have heard of or have had any experience with the International House of Prayer in Kansas City, Missouri then you have a decent idea of what the framework of this next season of my life will look like. The specifics, however, are unique to the body at Bethshan Church in Sunderland, England, and to the culture that exists in that region of the world.I am going to give my life to the poor and broken of the Northeast of England.To care for and disciple women and girls who come from various crisis situations.To reach out to primary and secondary aged children within their own schools- many of whom have never even heard the name of Jesus.To build relationships with university students and bring them into the community and family of Bethshan.To step out and share the Gospel on the street through outreach with the church\\'s many missional communities.To commit my time, energy, and resourses to focused intercession that ushers in revival and allows God\\'s people to look upon His goodness and love \"in the land of the living\" (Ps. 27:13).And above all, to worship. Over the next few years, we plan to have the House of Prayer fully staffed to host a movement of 24/7 prayer and worship in Europe. My role is to be one of the few that go ahead to lay the foundation of leadership in that house for the ministry to grow and thrive.I am going to give hope, to give life, and to give myself. To change an atmosphere, that changes a culture, that changes a country, that changes the world through a generation raised as an army of worshipers of God.My plane ticket has already been provided for, so the purpose of this fundraiser is to finance my year living in England- paying for food and bills- while I use my time and energy solely to serve and to pray.It\\'s an honour to invite you to be a part of this ministry and this journey alongside me. Thank you so very much for your support!Friends & Family,As you already know two of my children were adopted from China. My husband and I adopted Ella from Gansu, China in 2013. I personally have been to China three times (twice last year!) In May of last year I was able to join a team from America World to serve at Ella\\'s orphanage. It was an awesome experience to be on the other side of adoption (we met so many great children in desperate need of families.) During my time in China I felt lead to adopt a boy (we had already worked on our paperwork and we were ready to send it off to China the week I returned home.. our request was for another girl.) We received information about a little boy with cleft lip and palate and the rest is history. We brought our son Bennett home in December of 2014.\\n\\nWhile in China we were able to meet some amazing children with both cleft lip and cleft palate (a special need near and dear to my heart since both of our children have cleft.) Without special bottles some of the children may not be able to drink their formula properly. This year America World (ACT) is teaming up with Hayden\\'s Smile to provide cleft bottles and nipples for the children in orphanages and in foster care in China. I will be heading back to China in October. Will you join me on yet another amazing trip to China? Will you help me be a story teller for these precious children?\\n\\nIf you do not feel comfortable donating online, please contact me!All funds raised will be put towards travel and towards the cleft bottles and nipples. Thanks once again!Dear Friends, please see the pictures of three of our six classrooms attached. Thank you for all you\\'ve done, for your prayers, donations and support. Just as you witnessed this vision from dream to manifestation, so shall all your good dreams come to manifestation in the name of Jesus. By God\\'s grace we have furnished all the classrooms. And the playground is also 100% complete! The only thing left is that we desperately need a passenger van to be used to pick up and drop off children for the Before School and After School Program. For $7,000.00 we shall get a used 14 sitter passenger van. Once we get this, the fund raising project would then be completed. Please donate whatever you can. In Ezra 7:9, the bible says that Ezra began a journey from Babylon (the city of bondage) on January 1 and in the fifth month (May), he arrived at Jerusalem (the city of peace). For all those who will support us this month, you shall go from Babylon to Jerusalem. May the \"Good Hand of God\" rest upon you and take you to your place of comfort, celebration and peace.

And currently we are in need of finances to cover many expenses that we have. Many girls come to the rehab center and find Jesus Christ. Most of these girls were rejected, abused and were left with absolutely nothing. So let\\'s come together as a body of Christ and show them that there are people out there that care and are willing to help them! If you would like to read some testimonies about people that have graduated or if you would like to know more about the program visit our page on facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/GodWillProvideLifeChangeCentersOur chapel of Saint Francis in Jackson, NJ is the center of our ecumenicalministries, including free nursing home ministries, free Christian counseling, and ministries to the homeless, as well as weddings, funerals and music ministries on a free will offering basis. Unfortunately, our building is in a residential zone and due to its size does not meet the public requirements for tax exempt status as a Church.   The property taxes have more than doubled in the last 10 years and currently cost $7500 annually. Since Fr. Davidson is retired, his fixed income puts him well below the poverty level. The irony of the situation is that Franciscans typically spend most of their time ministering to the needy, and rarely have wealthy friends. While there is no monthly mortgage payment , the tax arrears are currently threatening to cause a foreclosure, forcing us to forfeit our property, his home, and consequently, access to the various ministries to which we have been called in our community for many years.  Please help us pay the property taxes so that we may continue answering God\\'s call to minister to the poor and needy in Ocean and Monmouth Counties, and tell your friends about us.If you have been blessed by God through the ministries of Franciscan Servants of God\\'s Grace, please share your experiences with us.____________________________________________________________SHARED EXPERIENCES:I have known Fr. Richard for 3 years now. He is holy man of God, and he needs our help. He has been invaluable to me and I dont know what I would do without him. He has taught me to trust in God and not focus on myself, and I know he has helped a lot of other people, too. He has never charged me or turned me away because of an inability to pay. In my current financial condition I could not afford to pay for therapy through traditional means, and I certainly cant afford to pay his taxes, but honestly, if I had it, I would give it to him. He ministers to whoever God calls him to help, and never gives a thought to money. Unfortunately, this means he usually ends up giving away his considerable expertise for free. As a result, he is a far better priest than a businessman, and even though he has almost nothing, he continually gives away his resources to those he perceives to be in need, to the neglect of his own needs.If we dont help him now to show our appreciation for what he has done for us, I dont know what will happen to him.John CapuanoAbout 3 years ago Fr. Richard and I were singing at a Christmas Eve service at Trinity in Red Bank. After the service it was about midnight and we were both hungry. We found that the only place open was the Irish pub about a block away. We went in together looking for something to eat, me in street clothes and him in his habit. The place was doing a brisk business. We didn\\'t get as far as the bar before someone stopped him and asked him for some advice. I sat at the bar waiting for him and within minutes the man next to me began to confide in me that he was going through some difficult times and was really in need of some emotional support and some good advice . Not being religious, that man wouldn\\'t have gone to clergy with the questions he was asking me, and the one who had approached Fr. Richard probably didn\\'t even notice that I was there. I have seen on many occasions that when the two of us are together, God shows up. Divine appointments, he calls them. We were just looking for some food and found that it was really important for us to be there when we were there, because two people really needed us there at that moment for them.Miracles. They have become commonplace to me. I have learned to expect them. I have also learned that perhaps the most effective way to minister for God is to just get out of the way. I have grown spiritually more under his tutelage than from all the Bible classes in all the Churches I have ever been in. Although many would look at my life and see failure, I have learned, like Paul, to be content in whatever circumstance I am in, and also that the things I have are worth far more than the things I lack. The greatest joy I have known is having the sense of being used by God in miraculous ways, and He has given me eyes to see. It is difficult to know what to say that would help others understand the importance of the work that Fr. Richard does, but I know what it has meant to me. I can only say that in my view there is no cause more worthy of your financial assistance than his.In Christ,Greg Hartline Father Richard is someone whom I have known for less than a year now, and yet in this short time I have developed a deep level of respect and admiration. We met after either a rehearsal or the performance of a God and Country patriotic concert led by Nancy Scharff at King of Kings church in Middletown. We met again several times throughout the summer by the fact that we were both participating in the annual Choir Fest on Gods green acre in Ocean Grove, NJ. We both share a love of singing to the glory of God, especially when surrounded by over 900 voices. Our acquaintanceship developed into a friendship through a mutual friend, and as the months went by we have performed together more frequently, and I have had the honor to witness Father Richard in his element, sharing the gifts that God has given him with all whom he comes in contact. While I am not currently a regular member of the choir at Trinity Episcopal Church in Red Bank, NJ, I have sung there several times this past winter. Father Richard sings there and has an additional gift which he shares in his musical ministry with his skill as an organ builder, particularly in voicing the organ for optimal sound quality. He has retired from the profession of organ building and yet freely gives his time and skill in organ voicing, working with the resident organist Allan Robinson, to assure that the music heard during services is at its optimal best to enhance the worship experience of the attending congregation and visitors. This gift he has given freely has saved that church thousands of dollars, and it brings joy to the organist and the choir to hear the fruits of his labor in the voicing of the organ. People watching may sometimes have a negative connotation, but having the opportunity to watch Father Richard interact with others is inspiring and meaningful. He is such a kind and loving person. Despite his physical limitations, he always smiles and shares his humor with everyone. He is always willing to counsel anyone in need at the drop of a hat. Whether its while grocery shopping, going to the bank/ post office, at a restaurant, or after services, it doesn\\'t matter. These divine interventions happen daily. Many times he finds himself at the right place and time to help someone desperately in need, and its amazing to see that it usually happens in places he hadn\\'t planned to visit. But he was meant to be there to help those whom he has helped with compassion and prayer. His gift of counseling has been shared with the community in His time and when they were in need. It is difficult for me to put concisely into words, all of the things I have seen in the time I have known Father Richard, but I will say that no other friend of mine gives so freely of himself to help others. I know of no one else within whom the spirit moves so evidently. In everything that he does for those in need around him, he asks for nothing in return. I know of no one else more deserving of help with the taxes so unjustly mandated. Please pray about it, and if you are able, ask God to help you find an amount that you can contribute to help this wonderful servant of Gods grace.In Christs Love,Holly HartlineI haveknown father Richard for at least 18 years. He is a wonderful man.  He\\'s a good Christian.  He helps people when in need and he\\'s been there for me when   I needed help.He\\'s also helped other people in his ministry.  He\\'s passionate and understanding. I\\'m begging when people read this message that you please help him because he\\'s a man of God and he\\'s doing the Lord\\'s work.  Again please helphim so we can keep his ministry going please. Donate whatever you can. Thank you .Roger Downing   I have known Fr. Richard Davidson for more than 20 years. When I first met him, he was a lay member of an Episcopal church. I watched him respond to the call to become a Franciscan and observed the changes in him as he began, more and more, to live Franciscan spirituality. I was there when he was ordained a deacon. The presence of the Holy Spirit was not only palpable to me but evident to almost everyone who attended. Many remarked upon it. I was present at his subsequent ordinations as well. I did nursing home ministry with him for a number of years at Country Manor Nursing Home in Toms River (now defunct). I served as his lay reader, altar server, and prayer partner.Fr. Richard served several other nursing homes as well. Although nursing homes have become a smaller part of his ministry, he still continues to do nursing home ministry on a monthly basis. Fr. Davidson is a Franciscan priest and founder of Franciscan Servants of Gods Grace. Although he says he is retired, he continues to give all of his strength and energy to whatever God calls him to. Except for building church organs and loudspeakers, every other ministry he does is at his own expense. Fr. Davidson was ordained in the Anglican tradition by Bishop David Guthmiller, a bishop in the Holy Ecumenical Anglican Catholic Church. Two other bishops  a bishop with Roman Catholic apostolic lines and a bishop with Eastern Orthodox apostoliclines laid hands on him at his ordination. With Bishop Guthmillers permission, he was subsequently ordained a minister in the free Baptist tradition. I attended all three ordinations  deacon, priest, minister. Why so many ordinations? It became obvious as soon as he began nursing home ministry that Fr. Richard has been called to an ecumenical ministry. Most of the residents who came to the services we conducted were Roman Catholic. However, when Fr. Richard invited one resident to come join us, she said, Oh no, I cant. Im Presbyterian. After hearing that he was a Baptist minister as well as a priest, she came to the service and quickly became one of our regulars. Fr. Richard is a gifted counselor. I know some of the people he has counseled and have observed the growth  and, in some cases, the major transformation  in their lives, through the grace of God poured out through this man. When my mother was in her final illness, he traveled out of state with me several times to visit her in various hospitals. For decades, she had sought the divine in Eastern religions and Native American spirituality. I had tried for years without success to introduce her to Jesus. Fr. Richard explained the gospel to her in a way that broke through all the      bad theology and misconceptions that had driven her away from Christianity. From what she said to me before she died, I am convinced that she died a Christian. Fr. Richard is also a talented amateur singer who sings weekly with a church choir. He also sings special concerts, throughout the year, with various other choirs and choral groups. You may have seen him at Choir Fest in Ocean Grove. Fr. Richard exemplifies the lack of materialism for which the Franciscan order is known. He lives frugally. Although his income puts him below the poverty line,he doesnt hesitate to share his meager resources with friends or strangers who are in need. He has repeatedly opened his home to people who otherwise would not have had a roof over their heads. He has allowed them to live with him for months and, in several cases, years. In this increasingly secular world, he is a truly counter-cultural figure  a man for whom no part of his life is secular but all, to the best of his ability, offered to God. Fr. Richard is the real deal. I am grateful for my longstanding friendship with Fr. Richard. I am amazed by his many talents and in awe of the ways God uses him in so many ministries. I was a candidate in Franciscan Servants of Gods Grace but realized that the life of a Franciscan sister was not for me. Yet, having tried to live as a Franciscan, I can see more clearly than most how much the vow of poverty has become central to Fr. Richards life. Although I have given him what I could and will continue to give as I am able, I cannot pay his taxes. I hope that you who read this will help to do so. If Fr. Richard loses his home, his ministry will have to cease, to the detriment of many people. You can help prevent this.Yours in Christ,Janet BirckheadIt was several years agowhen Imet Fr. Richard ata Steve Lonegan campaignrally, when Steve was running for the Senate in New Jersey. As a Secular Franciscan, I was impressed to learn that hewas a Franciscan priest and was involved with the Coalition of Judeo-Christian values: Faith, Family, and Freedom and several other organizations that I was very interested in myself. After campaigning for Steve Lonegan, we worked together on many various religious and political events  including celebrating the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity; the National Day of Prayer; participating in a monthly prayer meeting for the state government of New Jersey at the Trenton State House; and many other similar programs.Fr. Richard has demonstrated many times how his deep love and faith in God has moved him to take action to assist in reforming our political system and culture to the ideals set forth in the Bible. He is very passionate, zealous and dedicated to the work God has given him. As a Franciscan Servant of Gods Grace, Fr. Richard never puts limits on what God asks him to do. For Fr. Richard serving God is not a 9-5 job, not a business proposition. He is on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Fr. Richard is a tireless worker in the Lord\\'s vineyard, always ready and willing to serve. Fr. Richard has opened his home to the homeless on several occasions, at great inconvenience to himself. He welcomes anyone that God puts in his path and offers the Gospel message of love, mercy, compassion, kindness, faith and hope to all.He is doing Gods work and puts his own needs last. He is now forced to confront his own needs because the bank is threatening to foreclose his home. He is reaching out for help at this urgent time. Please be generous to Fr. Richard, a servant of God who needs help to continue his divine mission. Pax et bonum,Dorothy OReilly, OFS I am writing this proclamation of truth in regard to what I know of Father Richard F. Davidson, my friend, mentor, and Father in the faith. Is he a great teacher, is he holy and pure, doeshe follow Christ?  If you dont know there is not any need in reading this. All of the things I have stated above I shall prove in my following statements. We shall see if the above be true as well. It should be true in all Servants of God!  Father Richard was put to test in all aspects of the faith before me in my two years of residence in his home while recovering from a near fatal attack of complete neuropathic nerve failure, TSD, herniations of 1/3 of my disks and severe intestinal dysfunction caused from parasites picked up from foreign countries. He began to teach me not by reading or quoting, but by living. He lessons were humility first in dealing with a totally sick man in his private residence. Him being a very private man since the passing of his wife had become a Franciscan Servant of Gods Grace. Now a very injured, dysfunctional and sick man had entered his world. I observed him to be always busy with PEOPLE, counseling those not of his parish, but anyone who called and needed to talk. To the wee hours of the morning I listened as he patiently imparted courage, hope and faith over the phone to a number of different people who were desperate or just plain lonely. He would rise early in the morning and be off to either be finishing an organ system he would build from scratch, even the electronics and making his own cross-overs to insure the sound was exactly matched to the system and the house of worship. Occasionally he would even do work forgreedy self-centered organizations, which to my liking are as phony as the day is long, and then not be paidhis hard labors. He loved building these sanctified machines of magnificent sound. I would go over with Brother Ron to listen to their finished product. Ron is a well accomplished organist and friend of the Servants of Gods grace.  He teaches all by his actions of love faithfulness and kindness. I have read in the Holy Word of God that perfect love casts out all fear. That love covers a multitude of sins. I have learned by Father Richard that perfection and Holiness come from a love, I believe, Americans have forgotten. Greater love hath no man than that he lay down his life for his friends. Does this mean one time or is it greater to have laid down your own desires to love your friends and family every day?  Father Richard allowed me to store my things in his house and take a spare bedroom to continue the editing of all the film I had shot while with CNN, ESPN, TURNER, WMCN, and more to make DVDs that would be a help to veterans and others in developing their inventions. First I was hospitalized at the VA Hospital in East Orange, New Jersey and ridded of the parasites, then later had obtained a drink called Nopalia that enabled me to walk on my feet again. I began to walk more and more until I was getting around much better. The winter would torture me such that I could not sleep. He never put a yoke of tension or what I should do on my shoulders, which may have killed me. The VA only now, five years later after letting me suffer and even once again leaving me for dead, is taking notice! I began to come back to life enough to be able to move to Florida while seeking what I was entitled to 40 years ago. Have mercy as we have been shown mercy. Father never required either I pay rent or bethrown to the street. Did he sit with me and gossip about his friends and speak all manner of evil about them?No, we talked about science, his latest project, politics, current events, his latest TED Speaks video, engineering, language and religion. He made his friends my friends and I was healed emotionally on a first round. I learned it is not the church congregation, but the heart of those where you are.  I ask you now, if you have been moved in your heart to help support the continuing ministry of Fathers counseling, trips to the hospital, nursing home ministries, volunteering in the Ocean Grove Choir, the Trinity Church Choir, and the Garden State Philharmonic Chorus.  Please contribute what you can.Yours in Christ,Richard R. LangleyMy name is Laura and I am Jenny Mosier\\'s sister. Mosthave knownthe struggle she and her family have had with cancer beginning in 2008. Eight years is a long time to have extra medical bills and expenses. We\\'ve all shown them love and lifted the burden emotionally and spiritually. I wouldlike to givetheir adoring fans the opportunity tolift the burden financially.Sometimes saving your life takes a toll on your living. For all the details, here is Jen\\'s CaringBridge site:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/jennymosier. Jen was able (and needed)to take the summer off after working in the school system, but as you can imagine, fighting cancer IS a full time job. Her newest medication leaves her drained for much of the month.She is hoping to join the work force soon, but hopefully part time. Matt took a new job (yay!) that is better for him and the family and closer, but alas,pays less for now. Add insurance gaps, medication, 3 kids that insist on eating,cost of living and voila!--an opportunity for YOU and ME to show our love.The money raised will go mainly towards medical costs (tests, visits, medication, deductible), but I also want them to feel free to use it towards other pressing costs like car repairs or school expenses for the kiddos.If Jen and her family have made you laugh or smile or roll your eyes or made you go hmmm, please consider giving any amount. I can attest to the fact that they will be so grateful. And I bet we will even get treated to more of Jen\\'s loony but sincere writings. Whether you are able to give or not, THANK YOU.P.S. Another great way to help is by sharing this page!Family, Friends and Collegues,I\\'d like to share about an exciting opportunity presented to me. I have prayed and thought about it a lot and have decided to give more of myself to God by serving Him on the mission field. I\\'ll have a chance to share the gospel and be intentionally discipled in so I may grow more with God.On the dates of October 27th - November 6th 2016, my church Navarre First Assembly of God will be hosting a Womens Missions Trip to Venice, Italy. The cost of the trip will be approximately $3,500.I intend to contribute as much as I can personally, however, I cant do it alone. I am seeking financial supporters who will enable me to serve God on this trip.Would you partner with me in helping me make this possible?No amount is too small.Thank you, and I\\'ll continuing praying for all whom this message reaches.Baylee andIhave an awesome opportunity to go on a mission trip to Belize in June with our church, The Water\\'s Edge. When we are there, we will be helping in some of the remote villages with medical issues and running the only medical clinic in the area for the year. Throughout the week, we will serve over 1000 people. Many of them are children. While Baylee and I were talking about the opportunity to serve, we wanted to do more! The idea was born! With soccer being such an integral part of our family, we wanted to share our love of the game and bring the joy of soccer to the kids.This is where you come in!!Soccer is the #1 sport in the world largely in part because all you need is a ball. Our goal is to raise $1000.00. This will allow us to purchase 100 balls, pumps, and bags to distribute to the children. We appreciate anything you can give!! Whether it is $5 or $500, any little bit helps! Welook forward toposting pictures of the kids with the balls so everyone can see the excitement on the kids\\' faces!There is just a small window we have to raise the money. We only have 3 weeks!! Our goal is to raise 100% of the money by June 2, 2016! If you could help us out, we would appreciate it sooooo much!! Thank youin advancefor supporting Kickin\\' It in Belize!Baylee and KendiAttentionFortune Lake Lutheran Camp Staff (Past and Present)!\\n\\nIts time for GAZEBO-nanza!Did you know that the gazebo at Fortune Lake is original to the camp? That means it is nearly 85 years old! It was built in 1930 and was located behind the sauna for nearly 50 years before it was moved to its current location near the playground. It has witnessed weddings, marriage proposals, Bible studies, choruses of angels singing for Christmas in July, character announcements throughout games of Inherit the Kingdom, and too many staff meetings to count. Many of us have fond memories of the picturesque gazebo and it is difficult to think of replacing it. But its time to honor the original gazebo (and the many gallons of paint that currently hold it together) and plan for the future.Plans for a new gazebo are in the works and contractors are on board to build it this fall so it can be dedicated at the 85th Anniversary Celebration June 7, 2015. The new gazebo will be larger so it can be used as another summer programming site, but it will maintain the original gazebo appearance. Now, guess what? YOU GET TO HELP!Every current and former FLLC staff member is invited to participate in Gazebo-nanza! As a way of honoring the past and Driving Faith Forward (the 85th Anniversary motto), we invite you to prayerfully consider a monetary donation that will help build the new gazebo.The goal is to raise enough money between June 8 (summer program begins) and August 8 (summer program ends) to completely pay for the construction. In exchange for an $85 donation, your name and the year(s) you worked at FLLC will be inscribed on the ceiling of the new gazebo for present and future generations to see! (You may also reserve a piece of the old gazebo to keep for yourself!)If you can afford to be even more generous, for a gift of $850, your name can be inscribed on one of the new gazebos supportive pillars! More than one persons name can be listed on a pillar or section of the ceiling, so you might want to plan a joint gift with other Fortune Lake friends. Gifts in memory or in honor of someone who worked at camp are also welcome. These gifts will be recognized during the dedication service.Weve made it easy for you to contribute. Simply follow the instructions on thisGoFundMe.com web page to make your donation online. In the comments section, PLEASE LIST THE NAME(S) AND YEARS WORKED AT CAMP AS YOU WANT THEM TO APPEAR ON THE GAZEBO.\\n\\nYou may also choose to mail your donation directly to Fortune Lake Lutheran Camp to ensure that every single penny go towards building the gazebo. This site charges a minimal fee to process credit card transactions, so some of the donation money will be used to pay for the use of this site. Checks can be mailed to 138 Fortune Lake Camp Road, Crystal Falls, MI 49920.\\n\\nRemember, you have until August 8 to make your contribution to this ground-breaking milestone in Fortune Lake history. Of course, you dont HAVE to be a part of Gazebo-nanza. You dont HAVE to show your support of the ministry of FLLC in a real, tangible way  but YOU GET TO!!!Sincerely,Ruth Almen, Stefanie Ehle, Pr. Kristin Rice, and Ruth WarmanenMy name is Micah, my dad set this up for me. I am 11 years old and wanting to raise money for my church. My church is doing giveaways for kids on Easter.

Find us on Facebookand on Twitter.On January 1, 2013 I lost one of the most important people in my entire life; Dara Michelle Kusiv was my best friend and the older sister I never had. When Dara was 16 years old she decided to volunteer her time at an orphanage in Haiti. Footprints Of The Son is a Christian ministry developed to create a better understanding, advocacy, and care for children with special needs in Haiti. I would love nothing more than to follow in Dara\\'s footprints and give some of my time to this amazing organization. However, being an independent college student does put a set back in my plans financially, with your help I plan on being able to make my way to Haiti AND give back to their community. If I am lucky enough to exceed my goal I also plan on donating every penny left over. Help me, help them. Thank you!Good day Blessings to all, It has been a great joy of mine to see young men who are our future leaders strive to do better even while yet facing so many difficult odds. I have been mentoring young men and helping them to see the potential God has locked inside of them. Even in my own personal life I had to fight against odds in order to see the winner in me. One of my models to the young people is that life is like a ladder full of broken steps. But it doesn\\'t mean to stop climbing high even in your brokenness. The key is that the ladder was designed and position for one to go up which means that in spite of my brokenness it never changes the position of the ladder purpose. I have a vision of having a building to host many events in and a van to commute the young men to educational events and etc.. our mentoring young men program is a Christian faith based organization. I would like to thank everyone who has and will donate.I just want to make a differenceSincerelyPastor Jewan Draper(Portuguese translation in the bottom)Aloha!                 Born in Brazil, we are a young couple lovers and believer of Christ as our only savior. Gustavo Faria de Mello (Londrina / PR) and Juliana Aquino Castro de Mello (Cel. Fabriciano / MG).    We have been living in the Boston area, MA, for many years- Juliana for 13 years, and myself for 8 years. We met at Christ the King Presbyterian Church about 8 years ago, and been married for 6 years living in the presence of the Lord.    We are professionals in the area of functional exercise, sports and nutrition, in which God has opened many doors and has blessed us greatly in the work/business market. However, as Juliana became busy coaching and leading exercise classes while attending college (Exercise Physiology at UMASS Lowell), and myself working in the administrative part and leading two exercise gyms, we found ourselves involved with work and other problems and not placing God as priority in our plans.        Although we thought we had life all figured out, we as a family felt the need to pray and seek God\\'s will for us. We wondered if we were living the Lord\\'s dreams or if we were living only to meet our own personal and individual needs. Then, as a hurricane, He began reveal himself to us.     About eight months ago, God has brought Pastor Silas back into my life (a past leader of the King\\'s Kids - Kairos Group of King of the Central Presbyterian Church of Londrina /PR where I was part of a project that preached the gospel and redemption on the streets for about 5 years of my teen years). Therefore, Pr. Silas with his godly graciousness introduced to us a new opportunity to once again serve God through the Ministry YWAM (Youth with a Mission) and God has placed in our hearts the desire to make time for Him.     We sold everything we had and went on this path to serve and seek Jesus and His desires for our lives.Not knowing what he had planned for us, we had obeyed his calling with open heart and mind to hear His voice, and therefore signed up to volunteer at the University of the Nations, YWAM base in Kailua-Kona, HI as Mission Builders.    The plan to provide volunteering service for a month turned into three months. We worked with construction, maintenance and cleaning at the base. Then, throughout that time God was tremendous, surprising us with His plans and callings! Which were confirmed by other brothers and leaders who were also praying for us.     Now we know that God is calling us to reach and transform lives. This time in a different way, not only the physical, but taking the good news to unreached people. We are sure that sport and fitness is one of the ways we can reach out and transform lives; we can take the word of God beyond borders and change the future of nations.     We know we should first study and be transformed by His power. This study is the DTS (Discipleship Training School), which will make us spiritually mature and gain experiences that will make us stronger and completely focused on fulfilling His purpose.     The DTS course were enrolled, will begin on September 25, this course is called: Trailblazers DTS which means \"opening paths\", focusing on the 10/40 Christian window of world where most people live in darkness and are seeking the true light of God.     For this dream and vision of God to be accomplished, we need support of all brothers, sisters and friends whom we know and do not know yet.     We need the spiritual support in prayers of our family and friends, to keep us strong in faith. We also need financial support for our tuition and expenses at school and in our lives.     Therefore, we count on the support of everyone in this new journey we are about to begin.   We are sincerely grateful for you attention in reading about our lives and what God has been moving on us! Mahalo Nui Loa (thank you very much) in advance!Many Blessings! Sincerely,Gustavo & Juliana MelloBe part of this mission with us!September / 2014~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(traduo em portugus)Aloha!Somos um casal de jovens cristos, nascidos no Brasil.Gustavo Faria de Mello (Londrina/PR) e Juliana Aquino Castro de Mello (Cel.

Nos conhecemos na Igreja Presbiteriana Cristo Rei, e  6 anos estamos casados e vivendo na presena do Senhor.Ha muito tempo que trabalhamos com treinamento funcional, esporte e nutrio. Deus tem aberto muitas portas e tem nos abencoado muito na nossa rea de trabalho. Mas, com a Juliana dando muitas aulas e cursando a faculdade de Fisioterapia (UMASS Lowell), eu trabalhando na parte administrativa e dando aulas em duas academias, nos encontramos envolvidos com trabalho e outros problemas e no estavamos colocando Deus em primeiro plano na nossa vida. Mesmo com a vida estabilizada em Boston, sentimos como famlia a necessidade de orar e buscar a vontade de Deus para ns. Queramos saber se estvamos vivendo na vontade do Senhor ou somente vivendo por nossas vontades, e Ele comecou a se revelar a ns.Acerca de 6 meses atrs, Deus colocou a vida do Pastor Silas (ele foi um dos lideres do Kings Kids - Grupo Kairs do Rei da Igreja Presbiteriana Central de Londrina/PR) onde fiz parte no projeto de envangelizaco e resgate de vidas durante 5 anos da minha adolescncia). Com ele veio a oportunidade de mais uma vez servir a Deus atravs do Ministrio JOCUM (Jovens com uma misso) e Deus colocou em nossos coraces a vontade de semparar um tempo para Ele. Vendemos tudo e decidimos servir e buscar em Deus o projeto Dele para ns. No sabendo o que Ele havia planejado para ns, obedecemos com corao e a mente aberta para ouvir a Sua voz  nos inscrevemos no programa chamado: Mission Builders na Universidade das Naes, base da JOCUM em Kailua-Kona/Hava. O plano de prestar servio voluntrio por um ms, se transformou em trs meses. Trabalhamos com construo, manuteno e limpeza na base, e nesse tempo Deus foi tremendo, nos surpreendendo com seus planos e chamados, quais foram confirmados atravs de outros irmos que tambm estavam orando por ns.Ns sabemos que Deus est nos chamando para alcancar e tranformar vidas. Dessa vez de uma forma diferente, no somente no fsico, mas levando as boas novas para povos no alcanados.

Those who enter the door discover Christ, are fed through Word and Sacraments, and live the beautiful friendship of the Church. Once they walk through the door, they stay! But getting them in the door is the challenge! We are trying to transform the first floor of our Newman Center into a Coffee House like atmosphere where students might just drop in to meet, study, and converse. We want to get them in the door. 30,000 young people are passing by the Catholic Church! Will you help them get in the door? You can also donate by directly mailing us donations at The Boston University Catholic Center 211 Bay State Rd. Boston, MA 02215. (Direct donations make us the most money because there are no fees attached. But, all manner of donations are welcomed!)God has summonsed\\nme to get back on the foreign mission field. On January 30, 2014 he is sending me to Holy Land of Israel so that I can greatly enhance my spiritual life, realize my Godly purpose, and retain a true perspective of genuine faith. Actively doing mission work allows me to be obedient to the mission mandate of Jesus and further advance the Kingdom of God. On this trip I\\'ll walk the places Jesus walked. I\\'ll perform work that Jesus performed. I\\'ll minister in places Jesus ministered. Your support will help me fulfill the mission mandate of Jesus and further advance the Kingdom of God. Please consider sowing a seed of $10.00 to this effort. This small donation will significantly serve the body of Christ well. I\\'m simply a servant of God, being used by God to meet the needs of his people.Can you help give Raquel Lavia the gift of rest & rejuvenation?  Each of us, and our movement as a whole, has benefited from her tireless commitment to building organization and developing skillful organizers. We have relied on her immense ability to guide us through difficult moments with grace and optimism. We have enjoyed her bottomless humor and energy. She has given so much, inspired and cared for so many of us!And, with the weight and intensity of the last two years, our comrade needs our support and a break. Without an organization to grant her one or support her financially, it\\'s up to us as a community and as a movement to make this happen.Now\\'s our chance to take care of her, for a change! Please join us in contributing to Raquel\\'s sabbatical fund! No donation is too large, or too small. You can also give in other ways like miles or meals or places to sublet. Notes of appreciation are very welcome, as is outreach to others who would like to be part of making this gift a reality!Im excited to announce that I will be partnering with Adventures in Missions for the World Race Gap Year. The World Race Gap Year is a 9-month journey to discover not only what passions God has given me to serve Him with, but also what He would have me pursue as a career. I will be going to 3 different countries where I will spend 3 months in each country building relationships and serving with different ministries. I will be forced out of my familiar to be able to discover my calling. I long to be used by the Lord, and fulfill his command on my life. I had every intention and plan to go to Ole Miss this Fall, but God has laid before me two options: continue with your education now or give up everything and follow me so you can discover what I truly have for you. There is a lot of uncertainty with the latter, but our Father has great plans! Since this was a last minute change, but a follow of instinct, I will be leaving for training camp August 10-20th. Yes, thats in a week and a half. Before training camp I must fundraise $5000, and while on the Race I must continue to fundraise to have a total of $14,000I have spent ten months in Jinja, Uganda during which time I have been able to establish relationships with numerous people here. I have also discovered a huge need which God has placed on my heart. Many of the children here in Uganda, because of the social norms live as cast offs and have no home or family that will claim them. I have spent many months praying, planning, and getting to the point I am at today. I know without a doubt that I am where God wants me to be and doing what He wants me to do. That is to help these children to realize the dream of a loving family and a future with hope. It has not been an easy road and I know there will be bumps along the way, but I have a passionate desire to see this vision come true. Would you be willing to join me and the children\\'s home I am opening Forever Hope Ministries. I know that God has called me to be here, but I also know I cannot do this without financial support from others with a heart for children. I am asking people to commit to just giving $10 (or any amount you desire) a month from January 2015 to January 2016. This might seem like a small amount but it can make a HUGE difference in the life of a child here in Uganda. God has already placed two orphaned siblings in my life. In their young lives they have lost both of their parents, been kicked out of relatives homes forced to survive on the streets, and faced many things no child should have to face. They will be the first to come and live with me at Forever Hope Ministries, I know there will be more in the near furture. However, this cannot happen without the financial support from others. Forever Hope Ministries financial partners will receive a special update email once a month including picture of our daily lives, updates on the children, updates on the ministries progress and future plans. I want to keep you informed of how your contributions are making a change in many lives in Uganda. I also welcome any email from you with questions. Thank you for partnering with me to make a difference!

At the start of this new position I will be moving in with a local family in Cristo Rey, Nicaragua for two months at the beginning of November to help start a community center and child sponsorship program. Upon my return, I will be in and out of the US fighting physical and spiritual poverty in both western and third world communities. As I raise funds for my first year, I am also looking for monthly supporters that will partner with me to enable my continued full time work with Beautiful Feet after my initial transition-funds have expired. All donations will go through Beautiful Feet that they might be tax-deductible for each of you that are able to give. I am forever greatful for everyone who has come behind me in my journey pursuing missions so far. I am humbled and blown away by those who have supported me since I initially moved to Africa for three months after high school. Through everyone\\'s encouraging words and the provision that has been given to me since this journey began, I have grown more in faith and trust than I ever could have imagined before. And as I enter this full time position with Beautiful Feet, I can honestly say that despite some of the intimidating factors that can arise from such a huge transition and decision, I still feel confident that this is where God has been leading me to go and I greatly look forward to seeing all of the incredible things He will do through my future, as it has been given fully to his call.  giving me a place to sleep. Since I graduated highschool and moved to Africa for 3 months, I started a journey I never would have imagined. It has been incredible learning faith and trust and I cant wait to dive in making doing what I love a full time position. I believe this is the next step I have been called to take and although it is scary, I cant wait to see all the incredible things God will do through me giving my future fully to his call.Expenses covered through your donation: -Travel costs: plane tickets, bus tickets, border fees, mission-projects & more-Foreign living expenses: food, housing, utilities & more -Domestic living expenses: food, rent, gas, utilities, insurance, phone, medical & moreI would love to get coffee and talk in person if you are available, you can reach me at (239) 464-7595 or Chepejennings@gmail.com.

Thank you and much love!Click here to read moreand follow the updates of my journey.I\\'ve always wondered why God only reveals to us little bits of our story at a time. If you had told me a few years ago that I would be going to Hillsong College to study Worship Ministry for a year in Sydney, Australia, I would have laughed in your face, and proceeded to tell you just how crazy you are for suggesting such a thing. Thankfully, God knows exactly what He\\'s doing, and what situations to put each of us in to get us to become all that He intended for us to be. He has given me a heart for worship. Over the past year I have felt that He is calling me to pursue this desire with all that I am. In many, MANY ways, He has taken me far outside my comfort zone and is consistently showing me what it looks like to completely live for Him and what it means to let my heavenly Father direct my choices, my steps, and my life. I NEVER would have imagined it would mean going to Hillsong College. I know that He has been preparing me for this and He is providing a way for me to get there. Ephesians 3:20-21 is a great reminder of that: \" Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever! Amen.\"Getting to Hillsong is far outside of what I can do on my own. It is going to cost more than I can make. I need a minimum of $17,000 once everything is all said and done. That includes tuition, student visa fees, airfare, and a years worth of living expenses. I am going to do everything I can to earn as much as I can. I am basically putting 75% of my paychecks into savings for this, as well as everything I earn from cake decorating, house sitting and umpiring. Once I am in Australia I will be able to procure a part time job (the student visa won\\'t allow me to work more than 20 hours a week). By the end of the year I will have $9,000-$10,000 saved. Unfortunately, it is not going to be enough. I could really use your help to raise the remaining $7,000. Every little bit helps! If you can give a large amount that\\'s awesome! If you can only give $5 or $10 dollars, that\\'s great as well! If you can\\'t make a financial donation then I ask that you please pray for me. Please be in prayer with me thanking God for the funds He is providing, for safe travels and that God will give me the strength, courage and wisdom to do whatever He is calling me to do. He has given me this desire and called me to this and I know He is more than able to make this happen. I have no doubt in my mind that He will provide a way! Thank you all for your prayers, support and encouragement! I hope that you will remember that God is so much bigger than your present circumstances, and He is working out something amazing in your life that is only for your good! (Jeremiah 29:11) I love you guys!KristinaLast night around 2:45 am,most of Daniel\\'s earthly possessions caught fire. Everythingin his fifth wheel, including his clothing was burned up. Daniel has been on around 17 different mission trips, helped orphans in Africa and even helped people rebuild in Japan after the tsunami. Let\\'shelpDaniel rebuild his own life now (let\\'s at least give him enough money to buy new clothes), showing himGod\\'s love just as he has shown it to many others.Despite GoFundMe requiring a goal, I am not putting an actualdollar goal amount on this, because I believe all of you will give as the Lord leads you. Thank you and God bless!Hello Everyone!I am currently completing the second semester of my junior year here at Lee University. It has been an awesome experience so far!It is refreshing to be around students who share my faith and a University that pushes and challenges me academically and spiritually.I am excited to share that I will be traveling to Phnom Penh, Cambodia with the Intercultural Studies program here at Lee University. I am a part of a team that, through prayer and the leading of the spirit, was chosen to go to this part of the world. We will be working closely with PCL (People for Care and Learning) in their plan for building a city for those displaced in a local community http://buildacity.org.We will also be teaching in local schools by givingEnglish classes and sharing the Gospel throughout the community there. We will also be sharing with local churches in worship and in preaching, as well as childrens programs in the local community. This is an amazing opportunity God has given me. It is a privilege to know that He will be using me to change the lives of others as well as my own growth through this great experience. I will be leaving to Cambodia May 15th, 2015 and will be returning June 29th. As you may know, the price of getting there is not easy. The cost of my trip is $6,000.

I am a 20 year old student and a Junior at The University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tn. I have been given the opportunity to take a missions trip this summer to Switzerland. I am raising money to help me make this trip possible. This is not a pleasure trip, this is a ministerial trip, organized by the UPCI. I\\'ve felt a burden for the lost, and specifically those in other countries, for about a year and a half now. Mark 16:15 states, \"And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" I\\'m taking this upon myself to reach every creature, and to further my relationship with Christ.The money collected will cover all expenses required for the trip including: airfare to Switzerland and back, room and board, and food during the duration of the 10 day trip.Supporters can also help by sending checks or cash directly to me by mailing it to:\\nMegan Pope\\n\\n306 Monticello Rd\\n\\nFranklin, Tn 37064'),\n",

       "  'My name is Kaimana Takayama I am 16 years of age and I am asking for a \"little\" help to get a chance to surf in the 2015 Noosa Festival of Surfing in March.This festival has \"firmly established itself as the leading surf cultural event in the world\". This festival is going into its 24th year and it is going to be huge. I know the goal is a little bit high but I am willing to work very hard to achive this goal. I would really like to push myself and see how I do in contests against surfers internationally opposed to surfers here in California. I feel like this is a right of passage for my professional surfing career. This will be the first time I have ever traveled outside of the United States into another country. I have done all the math with airfares, hotels, food, a rental car, etc... I swear on my life that if I make this goal I will NOT let you down. Any donations are highly valued, admired, and respected.Thank you so much!- Kaimana Takayama\"Do not wait: the time will never be \\'just right\\'. Start where you stand, and work whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along.\" - Napoleon Hill We all have dreams. We have bucket lists, long terms goals, things we will do eventually. Most of the time, the timing just doesn\\'t feel right. Sometimes, you have to make the timing right...What happens when a San Francisco Internet monkey decides to break away from the perfect job for the greatest adventure of his life? The first page of this adventure has been written, but the rest is unknown... Help me tell the story of an impassioned community supporting and embracing those who awaken to their truest self, realize their highest purpose, and pursue their wildest dreams.I\\'m Jesse House and I\\'ve decided to give up my job in San Francisco working for one of the best startup teams in the world. I know that my life\\'s purpose won\\'t fully actualize until I boldly pursue the goals that I believe I am destined to fulfill. I realize that I\\'ve been keeping my destiny at a distance. I am stepping forward to manifest these dreams, this vision, and my highest frequency of being. \\n\\nFor the long-term, I hope that this experience gives me the confidence to take at-risk teenagers into the wilderness, so that they can gain perspective, and learn to trust one another and believe in themselves outside of the often troubling and distracting urban environment. I also wish to share and teach the practice of yoga, so that people can learn how to heal themselves and stay healthy and fit from the inside out for as long as they live. First, I must embark on this journey to embody these principles by stepping outside of my own comfort zone, committing fully to this lifestyle, and living completely and honestly in the present moment. With your help, here is what I plan to do: --------------------------------1) Thru-hike the Sierra High Route: August - September, 2013The Sierra High Route is a 195 mile, mostly trail-less, route-finding excursion through the wilderness of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Described by veterans in one word, \"burly\", roughly 10 people attempt and complete this route every year. I will carry food on my back and spend a month in the mountains, documenting what I find, and sharing it as I go. I hope to capture rare footage of these beautiful mountains and create a documentary to share with the world. The goal is to climb as many peaks as is reasonable, sharing rare vantage points from some of the most beautiful locations on the planet. AND --------------------------------2) Pilgrimage to India to become a yoga teacher: October - December, 2013The plan is to live at an Ashram as a humble yogi, going deeper than ever before into my own practice, so that I can return and help others on the path towards healing, balance, connection, grounding, and radiating love. I hope to document what I discover on this journey, as I travel both outwardly, and deep within. I hope to also show how people live on the other side of the world in order to increase awareness, compassion, and loving kindness between all humans on this planet.--------------------------------For both legs of the journey, I want to share the experiences - with loved ones, friends, fellow dreamers and wanderers, and supporters - through pictures, video updates, Internet blogging, postcards, and any other form of media that helps deliver the message, the story, the epic adventure. I\\'m asking for your support in the form of knowledge, mentorship, equipment that you are willing to share, information on places to go and where stay, and monetary displays of loving confidence. I will reciprocate by sharing fully everything that is given to me. Here\\'s a list of equipment and logistical items that I need to make this happen:NOTE: If you have any of this equipment, I can mark it off of my list, and return it to you once I\\'ve finished the journey.--------------------------------For the Sierra High Route backpacking adventure:1) Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) or Satellite Phone (w/ service) to ensure that I can communicate and reach out in case of emergency -- I think the delorme in reach se looks perfect~350 USD -- ACQUIRED2) Bearikade Expedition (bear canister) for food storage in the high country (required in most National Parks for wilderness travel) ~55 USD w/ shipping and handling **** UPDATE: The guys at Wild Ideas are loaning me one for the entire trip for only $55!!

I love each and every one of you and thank you in advance for your time, your consideration, your belief in the higher purpose of this plan. Please join in me in making this something truly original, uniquely special, and utterly amazing. Thank you all for helping to make these dreams a living reality. .............................~*~ NAMASTE ~*~................................Hello, friends of the internet! My name is Rebecca. My 7-year-old daughter, Anna, lives in Florida with her father. Every summer, I get visitation with my daughter for 6 weeks. In previous years, Anna\\'s father and grandmother graciously brought Anna to California, where I could affordably drive there and pick her up for my 6 weeks of visitation. I also chipped in with Anna\\'s airfare (1 round-trip ticket).This year, the situation is different, and Anna will not be able to fly to California with her grandmother. Anna\\'s father will not allow her to fly as an unaccompanied minor, so I am faced with either paying for 3 round-trip tickets from Seattle to Orlando (to fly myself there, pick her up, and then bring her back and fly myself home afterward) - or the option of not seeing my daughter at all for the rest of the year. I am still obligated to pay child support to my ex-husband, even when she is with me for those 6 weeks of the year - and my ex-husband is not obligated to share the cost of her travel expenses for visitation.Every year, I look forward to seeing my daughter in the summertime. Legally, I am allowed more visitation time with her (such as spring/winter breaks and Christmas) but haven\\'t had the means, financially, to see her for every occasion I have rights to. I made a choice not to have more children because I am already struggling to support my family with my singular income.Here in Seattle, Anna would be surrounded by family and friends that she hasn\\'t gotten to visit with since last year. This time is very precious for a young girl, and it would absolutely be a dream come true for her Mom.I have 21 days from today to make this happen, and to make my visitation rights into a reality of actual visitation. Anything helps! The \"Reward Levels\" are required for this style of All-Or-Nothing fundraising on GoFundMe, but I want you to know that I will reward every single one of your donations with my deepest gratitude, a \"thank you\" note, and time to spend with both of us when Anna has arrived (you must be local to Seattle, of course).NEW REWARD LEVELS ADDED! - Portrait Sketch by Jessep Bangham!\"For those who can contribute, you are amazing people and I will personally sketch out a portrait for anyone who contributes $100 or more.\"Please provide your physical mailing address and any requests for the image (captions, etc).\" I will confirm the pledges with Jessep directly.To protect the supporters, I am not able to change the existing reward levels after the fundraiser go-live, so I have set this new reward level at $101.00.If you donate $100, 101, or more, I will make sure you get BOTH rewards (Video and Sketch)!!- Pre-Inked Ultimark address stamp, donated by Ben Morhaime!If you can contribute $45, Ben Morhaime has donated 2 address stamps, which can be personalized with your address (or any address, really)! Thank you, Ben!!- Hand-picked music mix (CD) from Anna! \\nDid you know that Anna LOVES music, and I love making playlists with her? She takes it home with her at the end of our summer visit on a CD (or few).\\nIf you choose the Music Mix level at $30, we will make a customized CD mix JUST FOR YOU!In\\n my high school, the Green Meadow Waldorf School, each student chooses a\\n project that they work on independently throughout the senior year - \\nthe so-called Senior Project. At the end of the year the project is \\npresented before the whole school community. \\n\\n\\n\\nAs\\n my senior project I would like to convert a step van into a home on \\nwheels. I want to set it up so that a few people can live, eat, sleep, \\nand travel in it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter\\n graduation I intend to spend time traveling with friends, and the van \\nwould be our home! I hope to broaden my horizon by experiencing many \\ndifferent sides of life on this continent, the beauty in the cultures on\\n it, and the positive impulses that are happening aiming towards a \\nbetter future.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut\\n I can only do it with the help of others! Please consider contributing \\nto this project. I would greatly appreciate any size gift.I was born in Haiti. Left when I was 5. Returned again at\\nabout 13 and again at around 25. It\\'s been 10 years. For the past 2 years I\\nhave been having a recurring dream about the house and block I grew up in. It\\'s\\ntime. I am at a life changing place with my growth and I feel this trip is\\npertinent and important to my movement. I am a published poet working with a writer/ producer on a 30\\nminute film for a poem I wrote about my people and my culture. The poem is entitled \"Se bet ou ye\". Videos of it can be found on my you tube page.  www.youtube.com/mariemichaelleI am in search\\nof perspective and truth. I want to experience the mystic and reconnect with my\\nroots. During my two week stay in Haiti I will record my daily happenings via\\npicture and text. I will be writing a memoir of some sort based on my trip back home that will be published early 2014. I figured if I sat around and waited to make enough money to travel back home then I wouldn\\'t be going anytime soon. The time is now so I find alternate ways to making it happen. Any help is appreciated. Positive well wishes welcome as well.Ever since I was small I always dreamed about traveling to\\nEurope. As a 5th grader while I played soccer around my neighborhood\\nof Boyle Heights, I dreamed of going to Madrid, Spain because my favorite soccer\\nteam, Real Madrid (and my favorite player Cristiano Ronaldo) play there.\\nI never thought that my dream would ever come true, until now. If\\nI can raise the money, I have an opportunity to go to Europe next summer on an\\neducational tour with other high school students my age. We would be visiting\\nFrance, England, Portugal, and best of all, Spain. \\nI do not want to miss this opportunity because I know I will\\nlearn so much about countries that have so much history. I want to be able to\\nsee how people live in other countries and explore and learn about their\\ndifferent cultures and customs.  I want\\nmy mind to grow culturally.\\nIn order to go on this trip of a lifetime I have to raise\\n$4,000. The combined income of my mom and her fianc pays the rent, bills and\\nfood.  They do not have extra money to\\npay for this great trip. I am willing to cut lawns, do extra chores in my\\nhouse, and my friends and family\\'s homes to raise some of the money.  I hope you will help me\\nto go on this trip of a lifetime. I appreciate anything you can do to help make\\nmy dream come true!My name is Fernando Vzquez. As a volunteer climbing instructor for the non-profit Catalyst Sports, I strive to make adaptive climbing more accessible to people with different types of disabilities. This is one of my climbing partners, William Lowery. Even though he\\'s blind, he has never let that disability stop him from reaching his goals. Last July, armed with incredible will power, William beat every expectation we had by getting second place in the visually impaired category on the first USA Paraclimbing Nationals, and qualified for the World Paraclimbing Championships on September 8-14th, in Gijon, Spain. His family humbled me by asking me to be his eyes yet again in the coming competition, as they believe I am an important part in his success.Though I am incredibly honored, this had not been my plan. The trip is not currently within my means, and I have little more than a week to try to find the money... Which is why I\\'m asking for your help. William\\'s family was able to find me a ticket for $500. As a man of principle, I believe it would be unfair for me to raise funds for a trip for myself, while the real athlete has to cover his own costs. That is why I\\'m setting this fundraising effort. William\\'s plane expenses are just over $1000; lodging, transportation, and accommodations for both would quickly ammount to nearly $2500.Help us conquer this daunting mountain. Help me be his eyes on the wall once again. Please give generously. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart.I\\'ve been blessed with incredibly supportive friends and family and I\\'m certain that with a small push we can get all the expenses covered for us. But why stop there? Any excess donations will be transfered to Catalyst Sports and used to expand adaptive climbing programs making them more accessible to people in the South East and all over the US.If you have no money to spare right now, but still believein this vision, please visit their page and support them in any way you can, whenever you can. ( http://www.gocatalystsports.org)UPDATE: Thanks to the support of so many amazing friends, the initial goal was met! I\\'ve just increased my goal to $3000, and I hope the momentum keeps going! Thank you so much to everyone that helped me reach the $2000 milestone. I want to encourage everyone to keep supporting us, as it would be even more awesome to get as much as we can for lodging, transportation, and food, plus any extra we can get to support Catalyst. However, I have to say I couldn\\'t be prouder of the friends I have, you rock, and hopefully we will too.ITC was started in 2013 by Alex Taillie. With the support of Tiffany Madrid and Trione Vincent we successfully traveled to Spain with 9 students. Due to the success of this trip we are planning a trip on a yearly basis for students in the 38127 area. We want to provide as many opportunities to grow and expand our students horizons as possible. In 2015, we will be taking 6 students to Costa Rica for 10 days. In 2016, we are planning a trip to Paris, London, Venice and Rome for 12 days. Fundraising goal for 2015 is $25,000 and for 2016 will be roughly $25,000. It is amazing what a gift like this can do for a child. These trips are truly life changing and career defining for the adults.  Please help us reach our goals and be a apart of something big as we start to change the mind sets and goals of our students.I\\'m trying to raise money so that I can participate on a school trip to Washington, D.C. There are no school-based fund raising opportunities, so I am trying to work to raise money to go and thought I would try this, too!First off thank you for taking the time to read my story as vulnerability is by far the hardest thing to be in life; however, I have found thattransparency is the core to me fulfilling my purpose and the engine for which I extend to you this proposal.Over time, I\\'ve learned that our life stories can never change, but if we build enough courage intrinsically to share then publicly, it will help and can even save someones life. Throughout my life I have faced many trials, self-doubt and have fought against many odds but still have been blessed with so much knowledge, courage and talent to create projects and opportunities in arenas I only dreamed I\\'d be in.  I have worked with some of the most recognized facesin the industry, marketed products seen and used daily in homes across the world, and strengthened my work ethic to its highest level.Thank you to all who continue to call, text, email and encourage me while I continue to press through the completion of my first book. I have finished my first round of edits and now diving into my second round of revisions. Over the past few months I have seen tremendous growth in not only myself but also my support circle around me. It continues to inspire me and add to a story, which is my own. The people and experiences I continue to encounter are always beyond my imagination and Im excited for the day I can send a message telling everyone it is complete. Israel was amazing; it forced me to get out of my comfort zone and allowed me to see through eyes and document experiences I never thought were possible. With that said I will be traveling to India not only for inspiration but to serve others and hear stories of women who have been through enormous amount of adversity. Here is a little about my trip below along with the revised version of the first chapter of my book. About 2.2% of Indias population are Christian. With over 2000 unreached people groups, there are 1.2 billion people living with out Jesus Christ. In early November I will have the chance to travel to the heart of India, the Madhya Pradesh province, to provide Christian teaching to women and children in the region. In partnership with Mid India Christian Mission and The Crossing Church a team of 14 of us will be sharing Jesus with Christian women who lead ministry in their local churches. In addition, we will also work with Mercy Home for Girls, a Christian home for orphaned or abandoned girls, and Oasis of Love, and a ministry for handicapped adults and children. You can learn more about Mid India Christian Mission at their website:  www.midindia.com The REACH India trip is an amazing opportunity to invest in the women of India. As we facilitate a womens conference, and visit various mission projects, I am looking forward to building relationships and learning from the people of India. I am incredibly humbled by this opportunity and anticipate a significant shift in my understanding of Gods love and the hardships of life in another country. In order to seize this remarkable opportunity, I need your support. First and foremost, I need friends and family to pray for our team. The prayer support of friends and family is just as important as the ones who go on the trip. Would you please commit to pray for our team as well as me personally? You can specifically pray for our team to have the strength, especially emotionally and spiritually so that we can be witnesses of Gods love for the women of India. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and for considering how you can also be part of changing the life of women in India. I look forward to sharing with you all that we were able to do to help empower life transformation in the lives of women and families. ******REVISED ***** So that you can preview a piece of my work, I have included an excerpt from the book as well as a link explaining my passion for this project and the convictions to which I hold my life\\'s standards. CHAPTER 1 SHE ISBORN I wonder about that term freedom of choice. When does this statement actually apply to the reality we live? I assume society would say at the age of 18, but what about all of the things we arent allowed to choose prior? We get to choosewait, no, we are born into our living environments here on Earth. The entire process: our parents, our siblings, even the socio-economic status we would encounter all decided, for us, by God. We simply get to come to the home prepared for us, to the blankets and gifts made for us, and the clothing chosen for us. It seems peculiar to me that choice is so loosely characterized as the gift given to mankind, however, it so often comes misguided and unwanted. Aside from material possessions, before we were born, our parents chose certain emotional things for us. Things like bitterness, un-forgiveness, pain and economic struggle come to us free of charge, but at the same time are heavily priced if we ever decide to depart with them. Is it fair for children to develop these predetermined scars because of the environment they had absolutely no choice to be in? Or are the aforementioned concerns disregarded because at the age of 18 the child will be forced to deal take responsibility for it all? When you are born you become an individually new entity to members of your familys life. On the other hand, as a child your family now encompasses all you know about life. These people feed, clothe, bathe, communicate and love you, if one of those elements ever go missing is it fair to assume that the childs decision-making skills are mature enough to choose properly. Bringing me again to the question Does a child really have a choice? If the answer is no, then when is it right time to say the child is eligible to choose on its own? Confused yet? Good, well, this is the heart and breath for which I write this book. If you have picked up this book then its safe to say that youve made a choice, which leads me to believe that you are competent enough to make your own choices. Knowingly or unknowingly, the choice you have made by picking up this book was the choice to venture into the world of self-actualization. Thereby, relinquishing the responsibility from your mother, father or an Ex who you may feel have left you disadvantaged in this world. You are choosing, by completing this book, to walk away from the pain, forgive the past, and move forward- embracing the warmth of the unrestricted, you. To the men reading this book: I want you to know that women are not the enemy, though at times I know it can feel that way. Throughout this book, my plan is to express the enemy women continuously fight within. Enemies that make it difficult to be what you need us to be, which in turn result in the reality that if we are in this state of mind while dating you, then, you too arent capable of being what we need you to be. By the end of this reading its my hope that we, together, can grown into whole individuals willing, but more importantly, able to love one another. I pray you stay along with me for the journey. To the women reading this book: The choice you make by continuing to read this book is the choice to begin looking intrinsically for your truth. You are now the person free to make her own decisions, the person no longer allowed to blame your pre-existing conditions on the outcome of her life because your voice is now unlocked through the words from which I liberate you. The choice you have made is to take your story and illustrate the importance of becoming your own biggest fan. Dont get for a moment get it twisted into thinking that for some reason I cannot relate to your story for I, too, understand the struggle of being living with labels, wading through life heartbroken, and faced with the heavy burden of trying to put the pieces back together. Inasmuch, sweet girl, Ive come to learn that we simply cannot continue harboring the pain of the past and creating illusions of why we arent able to be what and who God created us to be. Its time we grow from here. I pray you continue on your journey to freedom because she has a story, she has a message she has scars that shes overcome because she made a choice. She IsYou. Romans 9:11: - For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth; PRAYER Father God I ask that you create in her a clean slate and that she is no longer bound by the scars of her past. I ask that you make her new, even whole, once again. When you brought her into this world you knew all she would bare. I ask that her wrongs are forgiven for she may not have known, but God today she is responsible and has taken the steps to correct her walk and for this she is born again. With a true repentant heart, Lord please lead her on. In Jesus NameAmen. All monies donated will go toward marketing, editing, trip and publishing of the book.Finally, I would like to thank you again for taking the time to even consider supporting my project. If you are receiving this message then you have impacted my life in some form. I would like to offer to the first 10 supporters for your gracious donation a signed copy of the first release when published.

This year I\\'ve committed to strengthening my skills as a documentarian by pursuing short-term documentary projects around food, women, and cultural preservation. It\\'s also an opportunity to further my creative non fiction writing skills as I am moving toward writing as an integral part of my image making.The retreat is April 25-30th, 2017 and costs $2,500 -- which covers housing, meals, transportation within Oaxaca and all programming for the five-day retreat. I am seeking $1300 which is the remaining amount needed to pay for the retreat.I\\'ve already paid for the deposit and have applied for a $600 grant to help cover travel and film and film processing costs for the project I will be shooting over the course of five days.The project will explore how Afro-Latinx Oaxacan women have preserved their African heritage through food and Yoruba medicine practices and I will be learning from one of my favorite photographers how to harness documentary and reportage to tell food stories revolving around culture.As you know I am a freelancer and on a tight budget but opportunities like this don\\'t come often so any support I receive to help fund this retreat would mean the absolute world to me. I haven\\'t had an opportunity to take time to focus solely on a personal project and this project is one of the goals I hope to accomplish this year. Anything you do to make that dream happen would be a blessing.Thank you so, so much! -- OrianaPS.

Mike and Deb have won the Valentine\\'s love story scholarship aboard the Simple Man Cruise in October. In order to make this incredible gift from Sixthman and SIMPLE MAN Cruise a reality, they still need our help! Mike and Deb have been die hard Skynyrd fans for 30 plus years and are extremely grateful and humbled by this wonderful opportunity. The banner, in the above photo, flies proudly in their home and on October 20th, they host their annual \"Freebird Celebration\". A time to honor band members, family and friends who are now freebirds. How appropriate for their friends and family to be able to have this yearly celebration in 2013 while Mike and Deb are sailing with Lynyrd Skynyrd!\\n\\n Unfortunately, due to health reasons, Mike and Deb are on \"fixed incomes\" and cannot afford to make the extra costs of this once-in-a-lifetime vacation. (they have never had a honeymoon after 20   years by the way) \\n\\nFlights are averaging $550.00 per person round trip from Salt Lake City, Utah into FLL or MIA=$1,100.00.  Cruise and port taxes are $225.oo per person=$450.00. Hotel costs for the night before and after the cruise are around $150.00=$300.00 It is a long flight and Mike will need rest on the 24th before their long journey back to Utah. A total of $1,850.00. The extra $150.00 would be applied to their onboard spending.\\n\\nIf there is anyway you could help send Mike and Deb on this dream vacation/honeymoon, it will be greatly appreciated. Thank you again for reading this and for any contribution you can make.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Mike would say \"Keep the Faith\",\\n\\nBrenda HaysAfter several months of planning and saving, my April 1st move date BY BIKE is right around the corner!!!I\\'m taking a grand cross-country trip from Tampa, Fl to move to Portland, OR. I expect to be on the road from 3-4 months and your generous donation will help afford the last minute supplies I\\'ll need before entering the biggest challenge of my life: bicycle parts, tools, camping equipment, freeze-dried food, light weight cookware and the list goes on. I\\'m taking on this trip because \"when it\\'s too hard for everyone, it\\'s just right for me\". However, due to a minor hiccup in planning-I am now behind in my financial planning. My car had broken down and cost me $2,000 in repairs. With your help, you will assist this tour and initial moving expenses once I land in Portland.Hi my name is Cheepheng Her and I will be serving in Thailand for my Intercultural Practicum. It is required in order for me to graduate at Crown College. The internship will be for 7 weeks and will cost me $4000 to cover for flight, food, etc. If you want to be a part of my journey, feel free to donate as much as you like. First of all, this is NOT a vacation! While I am in Thailand, I will be serving with an organization called Envision. I will be teaching English to Thai students, visiting orphanages, helping those in the \"Red Light District,\" and preaching the Gospel to those who have not heard about the saving grace of Jesus Christ. Be a special part of my journey to redeem lost souls and to change the lives of the people of Thailand. I am not asking you to donate hundreds to thousands of dollars, but any amount would help and would be greatly appreciated. It is not the amount, but the heart and willingness to donate that is more important! I will continue to update my journey when possible and will send a final update to everyone who has donated at the end of my trip. The deadline for donations is May 1, 2013. Please continue to pray for me and my team! Thank you for being a part of my life and God bless! \\n\\n\\n\\nRomans 10:14-15: \"14How,\\n then, can they call on the one they have not believed in?

I recently got a scholarship from a dance competition from West Coast Dance Explosion. The scholarship is to go to Vegas and compete. But I still need to pay for airfare for my family, hotel stay for 8 nights, costumes & 8 hours of dance choreography!   My family and I are trying hard to raise money for this. It would be a dream come true if you helped me out and I got to go. I worked very hard to get this scholarship and I pushed myself past my limit to get it. It would be amazing if I had some help.   Any little bit helps.  Thank you.Ain\\'t no mountain high enough, ain\\'t no valley low enough, ain\\'t no river wide enough, to keep me from finishing the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). My name is Sam Lillie, I just graduated from San Jose State and have decided to thru-hike the PCT to raise money for theAmerican Heart Association\\'s Heart Walk. A thru-hike is a long distance hike from start to finish. These hikes can last from weeks to months.The Pacific Crest Trail is a 2,661 mile (4,286 km) hike from the border of Mexico to the border of Canada.At a pace of 20 miles a day, I should be able to finish in 5 months.\\n\\nDuring the 5 month trek, I will face an elevation change of over 420,000+ ft. That\\'s like walking from sea level to the summit of Mt. Everest...17 times! I know everyone can\\'t take 5 months off from work to hike with me, but I encourage all to join me on the trail and be apart of this journey.I hope to raise $2,000 for the American Heart Association to reduce cardiovascular disease and bring further awareness and education to the public. All proceeds will be donated to the American Heart Association. You can follow me along the trail by \"liking\" my facebook page:  www.facebook.com/thenomadicheartsThanks for all the support!Hi there. My name is Mitchell and I have set up this Go Fund Me to be able to give my best friend and husband, Joe the vacation of a lifetime. At the young age of 26 an autoimmune disease destoyed his kidneys and he started dialysis. He did his treatments faithfully for years until he got the gift of a donation from one of his sisters at 30. The surgery was rough on Joe and they knew that the kidney wouldn\\'t last a lifetime. He got five years out of that wonderful gift. Not a day goes by that he\\'s not thankful for it.So he began his treatments of three times a week in a center full of other patients while working full time. I met Joe in 2009 and watched him literally fight for his life day in and day out. Enduring hospital trips, infections, access problems, you name it, he\\'s done it. I call him Superman. He\\'s earned the name. Fifteen years on dialysis earns anyone superhero status. In November of 2012 we were trained on doing home hemo dialysis. We had to learn how to work together in a whole new way. Team Wear was born. :)We have our own machine (nicknamed R2) and all the supplies we need to take care of dialysis at home. We do treatment six days a week for an average of four hours an evening. Joe is much healthier and happier being home and being able to have more frequent dialysis. An added benefit of our machine is that it\\'s portable. *it weighs around 75 pounds and we can fly with it as well.So, here is my plan:We are flying from Ohio to San Francisco for our first real vacation together. We are taking all of our diaysis supplies with us and need a space to set up R2 and not have to lug it around all over the place.Hotels, car rental (big enough to fit the machine), all of the normal vacation stuff.\\n\\nPlane tickets have been purchased so we are one step closer! We fly out on October 20th!Thank for for taking the time to read about my Superman, Joe. Thank you for helping me make this dream come true.I was nominated to take a trip with the International Scholar Laureate Program\\'s delegation on Nursing and Health Care to Australia. The trip is a great opportunity to learn about Nursing in general, but also how it is approached differently in Australia versus how we may approach it here. It\\'s an amazing educational opportunity, one that will not present itself again. The trip would be two weeks long, and the total cost of the trip is going to be about $5000. I need to raise this money by Feb 20th, and I would appreciate anything you could give to help me reach this goal. If I do not reach this goal, I will do my very best to return any funds you donated! I would be beyond grateful for any support. Thank you and may God bless you.Ariel is one of many who has been selected from Homecoming Queens around the Nation to participate and \"reign\" at the Autozone Liberty Bowl in Memphis. She was selected based on her academics, community involvement ,and her \"all-around status as an outstanding individual\". She will participate in a St. Jude luncheon, Liberty Bowl Parade down Beale St., and be on the field during the half-time show, which is Big & Rich this year. This will fund her and one guest(a parent ) for the 3 day event. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.Hi all,Hi all,My name is Bella Petroccitto and I am a sophomore at Sir Francis Drake High School. This year, I joined a club at my school called Global Student Embassy (GSE). GSE is responsible for taking care of our school\\'s sustainable garden, promoting a green lifestyle throughout campus, and each year we do a global outreach trip to either Nicaragua or Ecuador. This program has been very successful at Drake, and I am very exited to be a part of such a great club. In April 2015, 2 groups of about 15-20 students, including myself, will be traveling to Ecuador for one week. Our goal in Ecuador is to provide our environmental service work of reforestation of the Ecuadorian countryside, deliver public education, develop a garden for Baird High School, and build leadership, relationship, technical, and global citizenship skills that will give us the tools we need to be successful later in life. GSE\\'s goal is to plant 25,000 trees and restore 110 acres of tropical dry forest, and this year we plan to plant between 1,500 and 3,000 native trees and mangroves to help reach our overall goal.If you want to learn more about GSE click on this link:  http://www.globalstudentembassy.org/exchange-programs/high-school-programs/ecuador-highschool-exchange-program/This trip is a once in a lifetime opportunity and will teach my peers and I so much that we will bring back home and share with our peers at Drake High School and with our larger Marin County community. But I need your help!My goal is to raise $2,500 by the end of March, 2015, to pay for the cost of my trip. Your support would be very kind and all money will go towards the trip to Ecuador.You can donate any amount of money here on gofundme,or send a check if you prefer, (contact me for my address.) I appreciate any amount of money you are willing to donate to help me reach my dream of traveling to Ecuador and making a global difference. Thank you so much!My name is Billy D. MOORE and I have stage 4 metastatic melanoma. My cancer is incurable and inoperable. I have 4 tumors on my liver. I am going through chemotherapy, things are not getting better but not getting worse....for now. My wife of 11 months works part time only so she can be home with me and our finances are always tight...that\\'s the nice way to explain them. I got my diagnosis 29 days after our wedding (Aug. 11, 2012). We hadn\\'t even been on our honeymoon yet. This is the second time I\\'ve had cancer, in 2004, a year after my daughter was born I lost my left eye. That cancer was called ocular melanoma. I was cancer free for 8 years and thought I was free and clear. My daughter is now a beautiful nine year old! I am creating this site in hopes that I could get some financial support for medical bills and daily living expenses but also I have a dream to see YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK before I die. There is so much I want to see and do but it all seems so out of reach right now. I know my time here is short and I want to make the most of it. I want my daughter to have fond memories of this time. Quality of life is so important. We pray for miracles but we know God has it all planned out and we need to accept his plan as hard as it is. If our story touches you and you want to donate, I thank you in advance. Either way may God Bless you and yours.PEACE,BILLYI\\'m setting up this pagein an attemptto provide my 15 year old daughter (Hylah - she\\'s in the above picture in the upper, middle from 2011) with the opportunity to join a 2-week school trip to Europe in the Summer of 2013.I\\'ve always wanted to take the family on a real vacation,but due to family circumstanceswe haven\\'t, as yet, been able to realize that goal. So, when this opportunity came up recently, I saw it as a chance to at least be able to let Hylah experience some of the outside world as the trip will be traveling through France then to Barcelona.The goal is to raise $3,500 (the current cost of the tour) by March in order to participate in the trip.Hylah is a very involved and enthusiastic student. She\\'s been a 4.0 and Honor Roll student throughout Middle School and is now also finding her stride as a Sophomore. She\\'s participated in music since Elementary School (Cello, Viola, Saxophone, Percussion), played live in Disneyland with her Middle School Orchestra and Symphonic Band as well as with her High School Orchestra as a Freshman last year. In her last 2 years of Middle School, she was an ensemble player in 2 school play productions and volunteered as a crew member for a 3rd production after graduating Middle School. She\\'s done volunteer work with a couple local organizations. She also has been playing softball (primarily as a catcher) for the last 7 years in local recreational leagues and travel teams as well as joining her High School team last spring. So, I couldn\\'t think of a better way to reward her for all of her efforts (academically and otherwise) than to let her meet new people, make new friends and see the world with this opportunity.Thank you all in advance!bigmuddyadventure.wordpress.com Update: August 16th, 2015   Thank you to everyone who has helped us reach our goal! We will be shipping postcard, stickers, t-shirts, etc... out as we pass through towns! We couldn\\'t have reached this goal without everyone\\'s help! The Gofundme campaign will continue to run throughout our journey so please tell your friends about our story and check out our social media pages!We are on the water and invite you to follow our blog and instagram: bigmuddyadventure.wordpress.com instagram @bigmuddyadventureHere are a few photos we have gotten so far!Driving to Lake Itasca!Day 1 on Headwaters of the Mississippi RiverThe Department of Natural Resources has built emergency shelters for paddlers.Thanks for reading!!_________________________________________Embarking in August, we are planning to canoe the Mississippi River, the fourth longest river in the world, from its source, Lake Itaska, to the Gulf of Mexico. This 3 month long expedition, spanning over 2,320 miles and passing through 10 states, will be an important journey of self-growth and discovery for us as individuals, and an opportunity to embody the raw pioneer spirit of American exploration.To help us get down the river, we will be floating on a lifetime friend, a Grumman canoe. However, we will need some more supplies if we hope to obtain the sweet taste of salt water splashing on our faces and the cool sea breeze at our backs. That is where you come in; any support you can provide will be greatly appreciated! Your generous donations will be used for gear, food, and transportation for our trip. Additionally, a portion of these funds will be donated to the Louisiana Outdoors Outreach Program (LOOP). LOOP provides positive, life-changing outdoor experinces for youth in Greater New Orleans, allowing them the opportunity to experience the diverse wetlands ecosystem of southern Louisiana.LOOP works with at-risk youth in Greater New Orleans to teach social-emotional growth through outdoor skills. Since 2004, LOOP has grown to serve between 2,000 and 3,000 area youth each year with close relationships amongst local schools and youth organizations. In addition to academic-year programming spanning canoeing, climbing, camping, fishing, and swimming, LOOP facilitates summer internships that equip high school students with technical skills to become employable outdoor professionals.Since its founding, LOOP has been supported through Louisianas Office of State Parks. This year, a state-wide budget deficit has severely decreased LOOPs staff and program capacity. Friends of LOOP graciously accepts donations to ensure New Orleans youth continue to benefit from life-changing outdoor programming. Please visit their website at  www.loopno.org for more information!We firmly believe outdoor education to be one of the most important aspects in youth development, and that is why we are tying our own personal journey to the development of New Orleans inner-city youth. Having lived in The Big Easy for the past four years, we understand the difficulty that many children face in getting out of the city and into the natural environment. Being immersed in nature holds a pivotal role in personal and emotional growth, and through this Mississippi River trip, we hope to not only grow independently, but also provide a means for others to do the same. When we float through the Big Easy in the final stage of our journey, we will personally volunteer with LOOP. We are so excited for this closing portion of our adventure, as it will allow us the opportunity to personally spark a passion and understanding for the outdoors, creating a space for personal growth for those who need it most. To chronicle this adventure, we will be maintaining a blog that will depict our day-to-day experiences on the river, and will also be creating a documentary style video at the end of the trip to fully explore the impact and scope of our journey. Also, through a Q&A portion of our blog we are planning to educate LOOP participants about the Mississippi River and wetland ecosystems, as well as teach wilderness survival skills and boat safety knowledge. This is a link to our blog.

LOOPLOOP INSTAGRAM LOOP FACEBOOK PAGE THE CREWEver since meeting in freshman year of college the two of us have always had a taste for adventure, and passion for the great outdoors . Whether it be chasing toothy Alligators through the swamps of Louisiana, or surfing with hungry sharks in Fiji, we have always been looking for that bigger, better, and crazier experience to test our grit, and skill in the outdoors. We are happy to say that after graduating from Loyola University New Orleans, we are ready to push our limits to the next level, and embark on the trip of a lifetime. Mitchell SelbyBorn in the year of 1992, Mitchell set out to explore the world and see what was waiting. His competitive swimming career in high school prepared him for a life of water sports. Mitchell earned the rank of Eagle Scout then completed a National Outdoor Leadership School course where he acquired the skills necessary to survive a blizzard, cross frozen rivers and navigate using map and compass. After his first year of college, he paddled and portaged through the Crown Lands of Ontario where he found his love for the great outdoors. He then returned to the city of New Orleans. Once he was back in the wild, concrete jungle of the Big Easy, he enrolled in a study abroad program in the country of Fiji where he caught wind of a pirate treasure that could only be found by deciphering the trickiest of riddles. As much as he wanted to spend his weekends in the library, he simply couldnt ignore the urge to solve the riddle and was enticed by the subtle warnings of deadly undertows, murky waters and sharks that stood between him and the treasure. After spending 3 months of surfing, sailing and scavenging the coasts of Fiji, Mitchell found the treasure that had been left behind by the Dread Pirate Malcolm. Once back from Fiji, Mitchell just couldnt shake the feeling of adventure but knew his next outdoor pursuit needed to be shared with others. Mitchell was able to track down the Dread Pirate Malcolm and proposed that they paddle their way through America and write about their adventure in hopes of helping others get outside. The two lads spent many nights planning out the trip and decided that they not only wanted to paddle the Mississippi River from source to mouth, but they wanted to inspire and empower others to do the same. They hoped to inspire others by leaving a blog and donating a portion of their budget to a non-profit organization that helps youth stay out of trouble by getting them into the outdoors. The duo decided upon a Louisiana organization called the Louisiana Outdoor Outreach Program which utilized the outdoor environment as a classroom to build upon academic, social and organizational skills for youth up to 18 years of age.Malcolm ReedAnavid adventurer and experienced canoeist, Malcolm feels most at home out in the woods, sleeping under the stars, or floating downriver in his beloved Grumman canoe. Having just graduated from Loyola University New Orleans with a bachelors in Business Management and a minor in Biology, he is readyto pursue his love for canoeing, and completely immerse himself in the natural world before moving out into the world. Through this adventure, Malcolm hopes to gain a broader perspective on America, as the Mississippi River is the artery into which much of the country\\'s water, infrastructure, and culture flows. The ultimate goal of this trip for Malcolm is that of self-exploration and emotional development, as he wishes toadopt a piece of the pioneer spirit that has been lost in our interconnected society, and to explore one of the last truly wild and unpredictable pieces of the American landscape.Malcolm is also an artist, who has started his own t-shirt and design company, Malrkey. Mostly working in pen and ink mediums, Malcolm incorporates elements of nature and the world around him into chaotic depictions of his own thoughts and emotions. Through these drawings and illustrations, Malcolm hopes to chronicle the personal and emotional element of the trip, as well as document the raw beauty that the Mississippi River landscape has to offer.Our buddy Aaron sporting the Fleur-de-lis shirt (the FleurGear reward) down in the Big Easy.Dearest Greenfield Community,After such a long journey to get pregnant, Amy and Issac lost thier babyon December 26th. We are all so sad to hear about the passingof sweet baby Greenfield, who we were all so eagerto welcome to our community.  The doctors say there was an unpreventable, rare infection in the placenta that caused her to go into early labor at17 weeks.As you can imagine, they are heartbroken and devestated. Having just moved back to Sebastopol to raise a family, they are now unsure what is next. Many members of the community have asked what they can do to support Amy and Issac in this tender time.  Prayers and loving energy sent their way are greatly appreciated. They are feeling overwhelmed and private at this time and may not respond to phone calls or emails, though theyquietly appreciate the support. This fundraiser is raising money tosupport our dear Amy and Issac so they may have a little time to grieve and reorient to what is next for them. Any amount helps hold them so they can have a few weeks to process and rest and not need to think about working. They have a road trip planned to the San Juan islands in the Pacific Northwest sometime this month, once Amy\\'s body is healed from the birth. Perhaps these funds can help pay for gas, a retreat, a massage, or a nourishing meal along the way. Thank you for your generosity.My name is Jessie Lickteig. This gofundme page is for my best friend Kenzie Bixler who has been through a lot in the last few months. She lost her father in January and her brother and best friend Dakota Bixler 2 weeks ago. Three years ago, Dakota had bought himself and Kenzie tickets to attend Ultra Music Festival with me. The photo for this page is of the three of us at the festival in 2015. I have been planning on going again this year for a while, but Kenzie had not been planning on going. After Dakota died, she told me she wished she was going with me. The festival is in two weeks and neither of us would be able to make the money to send her in that short time period. I know how much this would mean to her. It would be a great way to remember her brother in a happy state of mind and would pick her up while she is down. Any little bit would help. Whatever this page doesnt come up with I will be covering. She needs something like this, and it would mean so much to her. Thank you everyone. Peace Love Unity Respect.******** Hi Everyone, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THESE DONATIONS... I am touched by this flow of money and giving. Some people have contributed by bank transfer or cash rather than this website, and I show this by reducing the original target amount of $5600 by that amount.

I have been accepted to \"The 10-Day Water Resource Management & Sustainable Practices\" Program in Peru! Check out the website to the program:The GREEN ProgramI am truly passionate about equitable access to clean water, as it is one of the most essential yet undervalued resources in the world. I could not be more thrilled to explore and immerse myself in the rich culture and history of Peru all the while learning about the country\\'s successes in providing access to clean water and sanitation for its citizens. Peru is a developing country with limited resources for managing growing populations and inadequate infrastructure, yet it is effectively coping with water scarcity. This program\\'s coursework, capstone project, and exposure to environmental planning and policy are exactly the work I am interested in. And it will surely bolster the skills I need to be a part of global sustainable water management solutions in the future!I just need your help to get me there!!Recently I was nominated for a very exclusive position at the Starbucks Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle, WA. It has been a dream of mine to work in Seattle since I started working at Starbucks in Jonesboro, AR almost two years ago. Although it has been my dream, the nomination for this position was unexpected. Unfortunately, we have had an extremely short amount of time to save money for the move. While we will be receiving a stipend from Starbucks, we still have many expenses to cover in order to leave. I\\'m asking for any amount that you are willing to donate to our cause. All donations are GREATLY appreciated!Part of the reason I went to PA school was to give back to communities in need. I have a wonderful opportunity to work in a small school in Panama, which operates twice a year as a clinic. The 2 main areas we serve areChriqui Viejo and Soloy. Local peopletravel miles on foot through the mountains and wilderness to reachus. Each year word spreads and more people show up. I need your help to get me over there and do my part. Please consider donating to this fund. The money will go towards my travel costs & food plus medicine/supplies for the patients. Any dollar helps and is much appreciated so I ask to GoFundMe and test my strengths ( I hear we all sleep in the same room, with limited showers, and there are bugs. You know I don\\'t like bugs.)FAMILY. TOGETHER. LOVE. The Bolster Family.Time together as a family is precious. Time together away from Winter weather, work woes, and the stresses of battling Cancer makes this even more precious.\\n\\nLet\\'s help the Bolstersenjoy family time with their toes in the sand, warm sun on their faces and lots of laughter. Jay, Susan, Quinn and Hope are true warriors everyday and deserve a few days of PEACE.I am going to be taking off very soon now, and I still need your help!!! I\\'m going to need money for rent/deposit and any other fees that may occur!! Please help me land on my feet so I can accomplish my goals!!!!My connection to Seattle is a strongand personal one...13 years ago, when I was 15, I was forced to leave my home and most of my family in Kalispell and make my way to Washington, so I might undergo chemotherapy at the Seattle Children\\'s Hospital. Despite going through such a difficult situation, I was absolutely enamoured with this city. I always knew that I wanted to go back...and now that the desire to pursue Art and Theater/Independant Films have become the center of my life, I have an even stronger desire to leave Montana and pursue my passions and feel I am ready to depart my home state...and besides there being infinately more opportunity to better myself in the big city,I want to volunteer at Seattle Children\\'s Hospital and/or The Ronald McDonald House and give back to those who have helped me in my darkest hour. If I can do that, then I know I can go to my grave happy.Unfortunately, prospects for accumulating extra funds are rather difficult in Montana, especially having no car and physical limmitations due to health problems...unfortunately,most of the people I know have financial difficulties themselves...This all being said, there are worthier causes to donate to, and my intent is not to steal thunder from others who are in greater need, but even if any of you want to donate even 5 DOLLARS, ANYTHING helps, PLEASE!! I will also make you a digital drawing to your specifications if you are able to donate more than 10.00!! Thank you for reading, and I wish you all well! <3I was elected by the people in the 6th district, Monmouth County to represent Bernie Sanders at the DNC...I\\'m raising money to help fund the exorbitant costs of attending the Democratic Nation Convention.  http://www.phldnc.com/Alexandria\\'s Story:Alex is a gorgeous 20 year old that was diagnosed with Crohn\\'s disease in May of 2004.  Since that time she has undergone eight bowel resections, colostomy placement and reversal; and several other surgeries.  She now suffers from SBS, or Short Bowel Syndrome.  This is in part due to only having two feet of small intestines and three feet of large intestines still intact.In the past seven years, Alex has spent over 1900 days in Scottish Rite Children\\'s Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and St. Joseph\\'s Hospital.  She attended Duluth High School for a short period of time where she qualified for both the football and basketball cheerleading squads.  Unfortunately, due to her medical condition she was not able to complete her school studies there.  She enrolled at Faith Academy where she graduated six months early with a 3.84 GPA.  She attended college for a short period of time before having to forgo classes due to a decline in her health.Alex enjoys being outdoors, arts & crafts, watching her favorite football team, The Georgia Bulldogs, hanging out with friends and being a positive role model for others.  For the past nine years, Alex has also attended Camp Oasis, a camp for children with Crohn\\'s and Colitis that is sponsored by Camp Twin Lakes.  The past three years she has been a counselor at camp.  \"Besides God, family and friends, Camp Oasis is what keeps me going.  It is something that I look forward to every year. Knowing what these kids are going through and feeling the pain that they feel is something that others do not understand.  Just because we don\\'t look sick on the outside; doesn\\'t mean we are not very sick on the inside.  This camp helps kids realize that they are not alone.\"  \"Admit it, who really wants to talk about butts and guts.\"  Alex\\'s health recently took a turn for the worse.  She and her family are focused on making memories; and enjoying spending quality family time together.  \"I want to be an inspiration to others while I can; and after I am gone.  Life is short so make the most of it.  I want those that know me; and those that never will understand that I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.\" I\\'m making this site so I can help Alex complete her bucket list. The main item on her bucket list is to travel to Costa Rice and explore everything that beautiful country has to offer. Any donations above the cost of the trip would help her family paying for the extensive medical bills they\\'ve accumulated over the years.Alex is a wonderful young woman who has given so much to others throughout her life; I just want to return the favor.As many know Amon has not been back to Kenya to visit his family in 12 years. This is due to the fact he did not have the visa that enabled him to travel overseas.Now has come the day that our special friend is free to travel across the globe. Yes he has his Green Card!!! We really want to gift Amon the wings he needs to get home and see his family. We are hoping to raise his full airfare (round trip, of course!) and give it to him as a gift in honor of the kindness, character, hard work, and friendship that has given to us all since the moment he arrived in the states.Please donate here however much you can and together we can give Amon the gift of a lifetimePRETTY MUCH WHAT ITS SAYS ON FACEBOOK. ONE THING SHARON WANTED US TO DO TOGETHER WAS TO GO TO THE KEYS. I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

The plan, to drive from Chile to Alaska; opening my tiny home for free to people who wanted an adventure on a budget.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut now, 13 months on, I have spent the last 2 months stuck in a mechanics trying to rebuild the engine for the 7th time! I have just bought a replacement motor in Costa Rica, which didn\\'t even get me out of the neighborhood and is in worse condition than my original. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem is there has been lots of request from people to come stay and in the bus, and although this is the aim of the project, I don\\'t feel it is fair to subject other people to all of these problems.\\n\\n\\n\\nA new motor is $3,000, but I have already put in an obscene amount of money into this project and for me it is just not possible anymore. So I am turning to you...to see if you can help me get me out of here and help me finally re-open my doors to strangers\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\nThe whole trip is documented on YouTube, so you can get an idea what it is about:\\n\\n\\n\\n http://www.youtube.com/user/kombilife\\n\\n\\n\\nFeel free to come and stay (if we ever get back on the road)\\n\\n\\n\\n http://www.facebook.com/HastaAlaska\\n\\n\\n\\n.....the door is always openWe are creating this page on behalf of our Father, Frank Romeo-to help support him to return to Vietnam, after almost 45 years!In 1968, at the age of 18, Frank Romeo enlisted in the army, and in 1969, he was deployed to Vietnam. During his tour of duty, Frank was critically wounded. Years after returning, Frank discovered that through creating artwork, writing and lecturing, that he was in fact not only healing from his own experience, but that he was able to touch others by teaching and sharing his message. Frank has dedicated the past 20 years of his life to sharing his personal story while creating educational opportunities to learn about PTSD and the Vietnam experience. It is in the spirit of truth, healing and understanding, that Frank regularly conducts art exhibits and lectures to youth and young adults all over the East Coast.Frank has continued to explore his work in the Vietnam experience and after receiving many accolades-he still felt as if a piece was missing. Our father knew that in order to gain closure and truly heal from HIS Vietnam experience, he must go back. As Frank explains it, his re-visit to Vietnam is a historical, spiritual, and emotional journey. And in the true nature of our dad, it is one that he feels compelled to share with others.In a journey that has never been documented before, Frank is inviting friends, family and youth and young adults from all over world to follow his travels in real time. Frank has created an interactive blog that will coverhis 1968-1970 years in the military as he \"revisits a time and place that sculptured my (his) life.\" (Frank) will travel to \"key locations involved in the war and try to bring a viewpoint only seen through a soldiers eyes\". Followers will be able to track Frank on his journey, and post questions as he visits these places and attempts to bring life, in real time-50 years later, to the Vietnam experience.Frank has continued to lecture and support awareness around the Vietnam experience for many years, and he has always done so on his own dime. We hope that we can show our dad that we appreciate and support his work and bravery in his decision to return to a place in time that has shaped our lives. Anything that is donated to this project will go to travel expenses, room and board and all other costs incurred in this trip.Please help us to support our father to return to Vietnam, and to continue his life\\'s work. Thank you so much,Love, the Romeo children.For more information on Frank Romeo or to follow his journey back to Vietnam, please check out his blog: Gotmysecondwind.blogspot.comFor more info on his work with Vientam Artwork and lectures:Vietnamartwork.comTo see a Channel 12 interveiw clip of my dad: Vimeo.com/96372603\"Frank Romeo is a disabled Vietnam Veteran, a survivor in many ways. He has survived physically from the pain and trauma of being critically wounded at 18. He has survived emotionally from the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that has plagued him for over 30 years. And he has survived spiritually through painting, public speaking, and writing.\" (J******Success! Thank yoy everyone who contributed. I reached Santiago 90 days ago and I couldn\\'t be happier about my choice to take the journey. *****Family and Friends,Welcome to my site! I invite you to come with me on my walk of the Camino.What is the Camino? TheCamino de Santiago(also known as The Way of St James or The Road to Santiago),is the name of any of thepilgrimageroutes(most commonly theCamino Francsor French route)to the shrine of theapostleSt. James the Greatin theCathedral of Santiago de CompostelainGaliciain northwesternSpain. Tradition has it that the remains of the saint are buried there. The Camino is a spiritual journey that pilgrims of all faiths and backgrounds have traversed for over a thousand years.Why do I want to walk? At this point in my life journey, I am happy with how I have grown and with what I have achieved. Moreover, life is not stagnant; I yearn for something more. After being introduced to information about the pilgrimage and after considerable research, I am confident that this is the next call on my life. It is my hope that through this pilgrimage, I will experience exponentially greater personal and spiritual growth. I am excited for the adventure to begin!What do I plan to do? The journey is 500 miles, beginning at St. Jean Pied de Port, France (near Biattitz) to Cathedral Plaza in Santiago de Compostela, where I will attend Mass atnoon. I have booked a flight and will be traveling April 29 into Bilbao, Spain June 10 out of Porto, Portugal. I plan to walk 7-12 miles each day, stopping at hostels along the way. I have 44 travel days but plan on stopping in major cities like Leon and Burgos.  Meals will be eaten nightly at the hostels and other meals purchases along the way at local grocery stores and bakeries. I will only carry a backpack and wear a fanny pack, which will carry everything I need. The backpack will weigh about 20 lbs plus a liter of water.How you can help! Most importantly, I need your prayers. This will be a physically, emotionally, spiritually challenging endeavor and I cannot do it alone. I will need your prayers: prayers for health, safety and protection, smooth travel, good weather and for God to grow me.How this GoFundMe helps!With your gracious and generous donation of the cost of one day on the Camino(40 euros= $40.... The exchange rate is very low), I will dedicate a day of the Camino to you: waking up and offering the day for you; praying for your intentions and well-being all day long; and sending you a postcard from that day\\'s starting/stopping point(post-office permitting).Beginning to end, you will spend that day with me! If you have a family member or friend that needs prayer, a day can be dedicated to them too. Feel free to donate the cost of additional days! And no gift is too small! For those who donate under $40, I will combine to make up one day and pray for the combined group.Funding Details:Anticipated costs of thetrip:\\n - Roundtrip flight to and from St. Louis, MO to Bilboa, Spain/ Porto, Portugal to St. Louis, MO was $1100 (This was purchased with my 2014 tax return)\\n - One day on the Camino(40 euros= about $40) x 44 days = $1760-Gear: Although I have some outdoor equipment and gear that can be used for this trip A lot of special gear and will need to be purchased. Items that have been or will be purchased: Trekking poles, boots, hiking sandals, rain gear, 33 liter backpack, along with some other smaller items = $1100Estimated Total Cost: $3960minus plane ticket = $2860minus $1100 in gear spent = $1760minus $839 in savings = $921minus $490 in GoFundMe = $431I STILL NEED $431 TO MAKE THIS TRIP POSSIBLE!!! I\\'m currently saving every penny I can and valeting extra hours to come up with the extra dollars.Thank you in advance for your prayers, support, and donations while I prepare for the trip of a lifetime! I will be creating a blog spot shortly so that daily postings can be followed by those who care to join me! Beun Camino!(Greeting said between Pilgrims on the Camino)Morgan RuppelPS: All monetary Christmas, Valentines day, and Birthday gifts have went towards my trip to SPAIN! Thank you again for all of these gifts.Hello Comrades!This is the part ofcrowdfundingwhere everyone writes that heartfelt backstory on why they are here, but mine will be a little bit different....I\\'m an organizer who works daily supporting our communities through arts and education to help break the chains of systemic racism and inequality. I\\'ve always been interested in the way that these systems work on the local, national and global level... and recently came across an opportunity for a once-in-a-lifetime international experience that would greatly help me connect to the Diaspora, challenge oppressive policies, and show solidarity with a resilient group of people. Unfortunately, I can\\'t share where I\\'m going, who I\\'m going with or how I\\'m getting there right now so I need you to trust me. I really need funds to helpcover my expenses here at home while Im away. If you can help me reach my goal I will be so grateful to you for helping me rest assured that rent and bills will not be out of control when I return.I plan to see, learn and share as much as possible during this trip. I will be hearing from and talking to many different types of folks and plan on coming back with a whole new set of skills, knowledge and deeper empathy for international struggle than I left with. All of which will be shared with you upon my return.I will not be staying anywhere near glamourous.I won\\'t be clubbing.I won\\'t be eating out.I will be working, writing, praying and planning the entire duration of this trip. So, if you will, take a leap of faith with me. I assure you I will come back to Brooklyn and talk nonstop about where I went and how awesome it was and what I came back with. Please help me make my dreams come true. This is not a vacation this is a revelation.Yours in love and solidarity,ShannonHere\\'s the deal friends, and family: This summer I\\'m starting my teaching career in Thailand, but I can\\'t quite afford the plane ticket yet.\\n\\nIf you help me, I\\'ll make it worth your while!\\n\\nFOR $5 I\\'ll take a picture doing anything you ask me to do and post it for the world to see.\\n\\nFOR $10 I\\'ll take a video performing any dare you think up and post it, including a shout out to you.\\n\\nFOR $50 I\\'ll do both of those last two AND I\\'ll make you a shirt, or give you a random (but super-great) gift.\\n\\n\\n\\nP.S. I understand I don\\'t deserve this money more than anyone else. But I\\'ll do my best to give back, threefold.Hello friends and family! There are many people in the world who put their heart, soul and passion into making a difference for others. Teachers do this every day. Sometimes those on the receiving end of these difference-making contributions \"get it\" -- they see what a difference someone has made for them. And they acknowledge it.My teacher friends and I often talk about how the best \"gifts\" we\\'ve ever received have been the cards, emails,andletters from our former students when they\\'ve been out in the world for a while and, looking back, they see the impact we havemade in their lives.We also lament, however, that so many teens/young people take these contributions for granted. They don\\'t always appreciate what others have done for them, and if they do \"get it\", they don\\'t realize how powerful it is for them to just say so.When you acknowlege someone, it is a gift of love for the recipient. When the recipient accepts your acknowledgement, it is a gift foryou.My project honors the incredible acknowlegement that I received from Mayank Bhandari, one of my former students. Through his ongoing appreciation for the difference I made in his life, he shows others what lengths committed teachers go to to make a difference for their students. Will you help me honor Mayank -- and accept his beautiful acknowlegement --by contributing to the cost of attending his wedding in India? Here\\'s the story....Ten years ago, I met Mayank Bhandari, a young student in my Academy of Finance program and a member of our DECA chapter. From the start, I could tell that Mayank was one of those driven teens I just knew would achieve great things. In fact, in his junior year of high school, Mayank and his friend Taj created a business plan that won first place at International DECA Competition in LA. I even arranged for them to practice their presentation for my college friend Jeff, who was a big-shot marketer at Sony Pictures at the time (I scored major cool points for that! Thanks, Jeff!) Mayank asked me to write his college recommendation letters the next year which, Id like to think, helped him get accepted to UCLA. In his senior year at UCLA, Mayank used me as a reference when he was applying for an internship with an investment banking firm, and I was an enthusiastic advocate on his behalf (they simply could NOT refuse to hire him!) He worked for Deutsche Bank for the past few years until he recently left to start his own company.The Proposal: One day last fall, Mayank called me from his office in Los Angeles to say he would be returning to Coral Springs for a brief visit and he wanted to enlist my help with a very special plan. He was ready to propose marriage to the woman of his dreams, his long-time girlfriend, Jasmin Beveja, who would soon graduate from USC Law School. And, he said that he was actually calling to ask my permission to use my high school classroom, full of students, as he had once been, as the setting for his proposal! I was so honored! Of all the places he could have chosen! Needless to say, the entire experience was delightful for me, for my students who got to witness the event (imagine the frenzy of smart phone photos!), and no doubt for Jasmin, too! (She said Yes!).The Invitation: Recently, I received a call from Mayank to invite me to his wedding in India! What an honor! And what an exciting possibility this invitation presents for me and Julian! Of course this would not be just any wedding trip! There would have to be visasand shots, flights to the other side of the world, deserts to cross and a castle to enter (Click here to see the castle where the wedding will take place!)And, of course, we would have to prepare to be guests at this traditional Indian wedding, which promises two entire days of splendor, ceremony and celebration, dazzling colors, dancing, food, friends and family!The Opportunity: Needless to say, this is the opportunity of a lifetime, and one that begs us to say YES! Yet on my salary as a teacher the cost is a bit daunting. Mayank and his bride have generously offered to provide our hotel accommodations at the wedding site, so we just need help with the airfare to/from and within India. Can you contribute? We promise to share our journey through Facebook, with photos and stories!Thank you!Some of you dudes looking at this page might know Louis, many of you won\\'t. He\\'s one of my oldest friends, and he\\'s been battling cancer for years. There\\'s not an unkind bone in the dude\\'s body, and I can think of a dozen people who deserve it more, myself included. I\\'m going to take him to Comicon in Phoenix on the first weekend of June 2014. I\\'m not a rich dude, just a single dad who\\'s trying to repay a friend for all the generosity he and his family showed me through the years I\\'ve known them.When I was a much younger man, I was homeless for the better part of a year. Louis\\'s family let me sleep in a 5th wheel on their property instead of having to sleep in my car. I was able to shower there, have meals there, they even had me over for holiday dinners at a time when my own family wasn\\'t around. They\\'re the raddest family I know, and I wish I could even come close to repaying everything I owe them (Although I\\'m thinking I\\'m going to find a weekend to drive down and trim the mistletoe in their yard like I said I would. In 2004. I\\'m a little bit of a procrastinator).I want to give Louis an awesome vacation, as stress free as I can make it. No worrying about meals, hotels, photo fees, anything. Just go to Phoenix, have fun, hang out, see old friends, do wheelchair racing, get in trouble, and possibly stalk Nathan Fillon (Okay, that one\\'s mostly for me. I liked Firefly). I\\'ve already shelled out for part of the hotel and tickets, and some close friends have also contributed, but I\\'m well short of what I need to make this amazing.I\\'m shooting for $750 to help cover hotel costs, food costs, gas costs for transportation, as well as costs of getting around and viewing different events inside Comicon. If I exceed that goal, that would be absolutely fantastic - every unspent dime will be donated to a charity of Louis\\'s family\\'s choice, or to Louis\\'s family to cover medical expenses.Louis is my dude, man, one of the oldest. Cancer sucks, and he doesn\\'t deserve to deal with that kind of illness.The last few years have been relatively rough, for the three of us, and our parents. Our mom has been there for all of us when we needed her, and she\\'s been the best mom she can be. 5 years ago she was diaganosed with a terminal cancer and all we want to do is give back. She hasn\\'t seen her parents, or her siblings in over 20 years due to financial reasons. They live in Europe (Germany and France). With this page, we plan to raise the money in order to surprise her (and her parents) with a ticket to go see her family. It would mean the absolute world if you could help show her that we all appreciate her by helping donate to purchase this ticket. And even if you can\\'t donate, sharing would help to! Thank you all, so so so much!goal went up due to ticket going up :( thank you so much.My name is Josh Crowder. I believe that together WE are enough. We can change the world. Every time we choose to show kindness every time we choose to love we are changing the world for ourselves and others. I am attempting moment by moment to be the change I desire to see in our world. I fear that if I do not change my world  if I do not act  change will not come.There are so many problems in the world. I am human just like you, and I have hurt and been hurt. I have chosen selfishness and greed and been affected by others who have done the same. I have watched pain and unkindness damage individuals and groups and nations and the world. What is the solution to these problems? How can we make things better? Today I choose to be a solution  to construct kindness and create love. Kindness is simple. In a world that seems to be full of the complex and unprovable, why not be simply kind all of the time? Why not flip the script everywhere in an attempt to flip the script of the future of our world. With kindness you need nothing but you. Together, WEare enough. For some examples of the tidal wave of change we have been generating through kindness, and that we need your help to continue, see these pages on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/joshcrowd https://www.facebook.com/youareamazingandsoamiYou can also take a look at the videos on this page which highlight a day in the life of a kindness journey.The next phase of my kindness journey begins April 1. I need your help to keep the journey going. As of April 1st I have no vehicle, housing, or food. All I have is my desire to spread kindness around the US as I travel and interact with others. I also have another human being joining this kindness journey. Bishoy heard about this movement online and saved his own money to come to America to help. He will be flying into Los Angeles the first week of April, and plans to spend the next three months by my side as we offer our lives as kindness to the world. Can you help? If you do, I cannot offer perfection but I will promise to do my best to use each dollar efficiently to pour kindness, love, and hope to our world through action. I will ask myself, if I were in the shoes of those who gave, or in the shoes of those I am interacting with, how would I want to be treated? I will then show love with kindness in every way I can. For those who give to the cause, know that my greatest form of accountability is transparency. I will keep you updated on the acts of kindness you are helping to fund. As I will be traveling without a stable address, my sister Melody Crowder-Meyer will handle all donations received and will disperse them on a need by need basis to cover basic survival needs as we continue to offer our lives as kindness.I hope youll consider helping me continue my kindness journey. And I hope, even if you cannot contribute financially, that you will contribute to this change by showing kindness to those around you always. Find ways to make a difference. And, if you can, please help me make a difference too!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery moment of every day we change history, the question is how - for better or for worse? Today I will choose to be the difference I desire to see in our world. We love and thank you world for being you. Kindness, Love, Peace and Respect to you,You are Amazing and so am I! We can be the change!Joshua CrowderI\\'m needing to get to California as soon as possible to say good bye to my father. I don\\'t like asking for help but this isn\\'t a time to allow my pride to take over. My dad wants to see me, my family needs me and I would like the opportunity to be there with him and for them.Even 2 dollars will help...and if you can\\'t help,,,I also accept love, hugs and prayersgraciously. If there is ends up being anything extra I will put it towards food and helping my kids or brothers and sister get there as well.Thank you for your contiued support during this time. your prayers and love mean the world to me and my family. <3Hi everyone! Thanks for visiting my fundraising headquarters here on GoFundMe. As you may or may not know, nothing gives me a bigger thrill then travel does. Whether just outside of town, out of state, or out of the country, exploring new destinations is a great joy and a great inspiration to me. This year an amazing opportunity knocked on my door when I was invited to travel with the People to People student ambassador program all the way across the globe, to the fascinatingly beautiful Australia. As this incredible adventure is an all-inclusive 20 day trip full of once in a lifetime experiences, it is not inexpensive.I do believe however that I am capable of fundraising the $7,000 tuition just like many other People to People student ambassadors do each year. To reach this ambitious goal, I\\'m asking for your help in the form of donations and spreading the word. Any and all donations will be a priceless step towards making my dreams a reality. To show my appreciation and pass on a kind gesture I pledge to volunteer 1 hour of community service for every $100 I earn. Follow me on Facebook (Klaudia Radon) and Instagram (klaudii88) for updates on my community service, or if you have any questions about my fundraising quest or my Australian Adventure. Thank you for your support and your shared excitement for my incredible opportunity! Check out this link for more information about the People to People Australian Adventure delegation http://www.peopletopeople.com/find-a-trip/all-programs/australia/australian-adventure?Grades=10&ZipCodes=08879Hi all family and friends!Most of you who follow me through social media know that I have been on several archaeological adventures around Florida, and most recently at Kolomoki Mounds State Park in Georgia. I have been lucky to be able to conduct research and participate in various excavations around the Southeast US, but now I have been blessed withthe opportunity to assist in an archaeological project in Tlaxcallan, Mexico. Digging in Central America has always been a dream of mine, and now several prominent archaeologists have asked me to join them for two monthson their project in Mexico starting June 15.However, a trip like this is very costly, and I really need your help in bringing this dream of mine to fruition. I will have to pay for airfare, archaeological supplies (such as books, tools, and some good boots), food, and other necessities for the two months I will be away. I also need to continue paying rent for my apartment here in the States while I am gone so when I come back I am not homeless.All donations will go toward these necessities so that I can take this opportunity and run with it, and along the way I will constantly update you on my adventures abroad. This is not a vacation- I am going to be working hard- and I plan to make something great of this experience. Any donation will be much appreciated, and if you cant give, please share this with your friends and family on social media. Thank you to everyone in advance, I will be writing to you all from Mexico soon!Hey everyone hope everyone has an amazing 2015! I have started this GoFundMe to start my year off with a memorable event. As all of you know I am an avid hunter and outdoorsman. Well so is my father but because of our work and schedules we have hunted very little together. He is retired Army of 20 years and has been working DOD And you all know I\\'m a drifter and work everywhere. Well it just so happens I have a guided SnowGoose hunt coming up this February 13th 14th and 15th. I can count the number of times my dad and I have waterfowl hunted on both of my hands. Heck look at the above photo it isone of our only hunting pics together and it is atleast 6 years old!!The funds raised would cover all of the expenses of this trip for my father and I. My dad is an extremely reserved hunter and has never experienced a hunt like this. The memories that would be made on this hunt would be priceless. There is something magical about watching a tornado of geese flip, flop, roll, and dive their way down to a decoy spread and the only thing that would top it off would be if I could sit in a blind next to my grouchy ass old man and sling some steel in the process. Thank you all for taking the time to read this and for any donations that you may provide!!Family and Friends... Lindas cancer has spread into her liver and as of last week her numbers have tripled. Her doctors say there is not much they can do at this point, she is taking a chemo pill that will hopefully slow things down. So far that isn\\'t happening. Linda and Geno have always wanted to visit Ireland, they have been saving for their trip for years but in light of the cancer, they have used their savings to make ends meet. On Friday they booked their tickets to Ireland, paid via credit card because Geno wants to take her while she is still feeling good and able to enjoy their time together. Many of you have asked how you can help... They are leaving Thursday (September 24) for two weeks. I would love to either send them off with some $ so they can enjoy their trip OR have some cash waiting for them upon their return. Anyone who wants to contribute, please donate now! It would be amazing if they could have the time of their lives! May the luck of the Irish be with all of you!John Newton is a wonderful 19 year old Army soldier stationed in Alaska. It will cost him $1600 to fly home for Christmas. That is a huge amount for a young man who is giving his life to protect our country. Your financial gift will allow him to come home and recharge . No amount is too small.....give as your heart leads. John is one of 5 children and a member of a very close family. Can\\'t think of a better way to show a young soldier how much we appreciate his service....time away from family is quite a price. Thank you and God Bless!!!Rhonda LiskHi everyone, my name is Steve Roper. I\\'m from Grand Rapids, Michigan and attend a small school named Lindenwood University - Belleville in southern Illinois. I\\'ve just recently graduated fromcollege and I majored in business administration. I also recieved a minor in sports management and I\\'m still chasing my dream of playing professional basketball at the highest level possible (NBA) someday. I\\'m not exactly sure what I want to do with my degree, but I\\'ve always been interested in inventing something or starting my own business. I\\'m actually in the process of starting my very own clothing line called \"Grusle\" and I was thinking maybe one day owning my very own NBA team once I\\'m retired and was done playing. My ultimate goal in life is to continue playing basketball and to be a mentor to children with the same dream. This summer I worked very hard to improve my basketball skills and was presented an opportunity to play basketball at the next level. There\\'s only one thing standing in my way of making my dream come true and that\\'s the expenses to cover my trip and different camps I will need to attend. I have to raise enough money to cover my travel, visa, different pro camps I will attend, food when I travel, and any other expenses I might have to cover during my journey. I would truly appreciate anything that someone can donate. I want to promise everyone that when I make it I will work harder than I\\'ve ever worked in my life. I won\\'t let these opportunities pass me by. I feel like this is everything I\\'ve always dreamed about so I won\\'t stop until I make it. Thank you for everything, stay blessed!I just want to thank anyone that took the time out to read this and always a special thank you to anyone that decides to donate. I appreciate you so much!\\n\\nCheck out my \"Why Do I Succeed?\" video.'),\n",

After a few requests, we decided to start up this page once again.  Shannon was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 while she was 7 months pregnant. She started treatments while pregnant and she gave birth to a beautiful little girl, Siena Hope. She has continued to fight each time a curve ball is thrown at her. We love you Shannon and we can\\'t wait to be back on the dance floor all together again dancing in your honor.  #ShannonsSoldiersLISTEN TO THE SONG HAPPY HERE A SONG...Several years ago a director came to me and asked me to write a song for a movie he was making. The movie was about one night in the lives of one family who uncover a lifelong secret, and the toll this secret takes on the family. The movie is inspired bytrue stories of people surviving trauma. The key word here is survival, because in the end, it\\'s not about our experiences, but what we do with them.  This was the impetus for the song HAPPY, written by the incredible songwriter Patrick Kelly and myself featured in Michael Wechslers movie Altered Minds starring Judd Hirsch and C.S. Lee.LISTEN TO THE SONG HAPPY HERE A NOM... So many people write incredible music that becomes the soundtrack to big and small moments in all our lives. It was phenomenal to have HAPPY as the title track of a film. Waking to find the song a contender for an Academy Award nomination.That said, the song does not have the PR machine behind it most of the contenders do to vie for a nomination. But maybe we have something else. Passion has got us this far, now we need help to take the final step. We are creating this campaign to give our song a chance. To get it some marketing and PR help. The challenge is crazy. We have two weeks to campaign for this nomination. Announcements are January 8th. Still we are going for it. The plan - to do all we can before then to let the world know, that underdogs can fly.A PLAN... To get to the nomination, we need marketing funding. We have two weeks to raise $10,000. This is the cost for one ad for a week online in a Hollywood trade paper. Because we have no PR or industry machine behind us, this is the one shot to get word out to the folks that vote, about our little song that could. Crazy right? But also amazing, as is this whole adventure.A DEADLINE....The voting for the final nominations for Best Original Song is happening right now until Januray 8th! There are 74 Official Contenders, and they will choose 5. If you beleive in this song, please consider supporting us. Thank you and here\\'s to the dreamer and underdog in all of us.

This crowd-sourced-fund-raising venture represents a really exciting time for me as a harmoncia player and artist.  It has been over 20 years since i produced my last harmonica record (Mouth Organ Minstrel). As the years have rolled on by, it has always been my dream to produce a double album with one CD devoted to Celtic & American Stringband Music and a companion CD with Blues and Solo Harp Styles. A smorgasbord of music, from dance tunes, to ballads, blues and beyond. The canon of Harmonica Americana is rich and deep and i have spent much of my career passionately minning these treasures.Now it is time to share these lost old gems with the world via a double CD titled: Harmonica Americana. I plan to enlist the best musicians in Milwaukee to support this effort which we\\'ll record at the legendary Surround Sound Studiosand begin recording in late June with a target release date of late summer. Lil Rev Harmonica SampleIf you are reading this page, chances are you have heard me play harmonica some where along the way and hopefully have found some joy therein. If this is so, i am hopeful that you might consider supporting this project and it is with the utmost thankfulness that i tip my hat to you for your consideration.I\\'ve been accepted into the Interlochen Arts Academy this school year for my songwriting, but my family can\\'t afford to pay the tuition.Please donate whatever you can spare so that maybe I can spend this school year learning about what I love with songwriters and artists just like me!To honor my dad\\'s incredibly successful 36 year career as a band director (31 of those years at Perkins), I am in the process ofcommissioning a piece of music for him. This is a timeless gift that will help his passion for and impact on music education live on forever in print...far after his retirement. It is also an amazing way to give back to a man who gave EVERYTHING to his students. I am still in communication with two different composers who are willing to write this piece of music, and will post more information when final details are decided. BUT, I do know that we will need to begin to raise at least $4,000 to make this possible! Any small amount you could contribute would be much appreciated!Also, this is a surprise and will be presented to him at the Pops Concert on May 15th. So, keep your lips sealed!

We are excited to announce our new web series featuring the World\\'s #1 Motivator, Les Brown, Our upcoming interview with actor, Morris Chestnut and much much more!One of my goals is own my own production studio. It has been my passion to constantly produce quality content (tv shows, films, documentaries) that will add value, laughter, love and substance to the world. We only lack sufficient funds to get started.So, today, I relaunched an online campaign to raise $ 50,000 to start The Reel Network Film division. This amount will cover all expenses needed to function for the first two years of production.As I launch this new division, I am asking the community for help. No donation is too large or small, we just want to begin creating on a continuous basis starting January 1, 2016.On April 8th, 2015 we lost not only a son, brother, nephew, father, but also a friend to many. Jason proudly served in the United States Marine Corp and retired after 20 years as a Gunnery Sergeant. He continued to live in Massachusetts continuing and completing his education in HVAC. He loved his family and friends, his fellow Marines, his bands, and of course his music. Jason suddenly passed with no suffering or pain naturally finding out the cause was coronary artery disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, meaning a sudden heart attack. We plan to have a military service in Michigan but need as much help as anyone is willing and able to give to get him back to Michigan so his family can say a final goodbye. We will be having the service on April 18th at 11am but we do have to pay $8500 in full and that will take care of everything except a stone. We will be having Jason cremated and will bury part of him to lay to rest by his daughter Erica Mills here, and the other in Massachusetts. Again any help we appreciate no amount is too small. We thank you all for your continuing support and please share!So, where to begin. I\\'m sure most of you reading this have been sent here by a friend and already know about this, if not I will provide yousome insight on th situation. Errick Easterday is a local photographer. His selflessness has allowed him to attend local, and national shows and festivals in which he stands on stage, running back and forth dodging fans just to get pictures for bands. Mostof the time these bands don\\'t offer to pay him, but use his images for merchandise, social media, and press related items to gain exposure for their band. Errick has never once asked for money to do any of this, he does this because he loves music and capturing the moments involved. This being said, taking pictures for bands is not just a hobby for Errick, this is a career. The equipment he uses to take these pictures cost the same amount as the bands gear on the stage. The lifetyle isn\\'t very profitable while you\\'re trying to gain clientele, along with establishing a name for yourself. But, in the past 4 years, Errick has made a name for himself in the quality and professionalism of his pictures. Aside from being taken on a few tours with Foreveratlast to document their moments of the rock n roll dream, he hasn\\'t made any money to further his career and dream. With this being said, the money you donate on this campaign will be funded to help Errick with the following;1) A reliable vehicle in the price range of $2,500-$3,000.2) License and registration fees.3) Insurance.4) Upgrading his photography equipment.We hope that every band that has used and or posted one of his images to donate. If you can\\'t afford to donate, we ask you please share this campaign to help us reach our goal.Also, it will be great for Errick to stop asking for a ride to every show just to take pictures.The High Street Harmonix have just started a very big semester! After only 2 years as an established group, the group has a lot of goals and asperations. After our 3rd place show at the ICCA\\'s we\\'re hoping to record at the end of the semester, and we need your help!! We need to raise 6,000 dollars and we want YOU to be a contributor! When do we need this money by?April 20thIf we raise this money, High Street Harmonix will be able to record with THE premiere acapella recording company, The Vocal Company. The group will travel to Rochester, New York and record in their professional studio, Sled Dog Studios. IN ADDITION, this money will fund a full fledged music video, created by the same company.!! How cool is that?! We hope to make this fun for you too by giving prizes for specific donation amounts! \\n\\nPlease help us make this dream a reality!Carolina Gold is asking all of its members and staff to help out in our last fundraiser of the year by finding a single $7 donation every day until DCA Championships.We\\'re often asked about our travel distances being a DCA corps and for this season we\\'ll end up travelling 7,000 in our (7) regular season performances and DCA Championships. In 2013, because of weather and other circumstances out of our control we only were able to participate in (2) DCA regular season events so this year we made great strides to increase our competitive performance schedule to greater reward our membership for all the hard work they put into this activity. Already this season we\\'ve had some great trips and performed in some great stadiums (such as PPL Park in Philadelphia, PA and the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA). \\n\\n\\nWith this increased performance schedule obviously comes increased costs and travel, transportation being our biggest cost to running the organization. \\n\\nSo, we\\'re asking your support in finishing our season off strong with your support of $7. For what some of you coffee addicts spend at Starbucks todayyou can help pay for the buses and hotels required to make that final trip to Rochester, NY.We\\'re down to the last few days before we have to decide whether we\\'re able to make the trip or cancel. Can you help?Hi Everyone! After many years of hard work, I finally have representatives of artists like Tim McGraw, Ronnie Milsap, John Michael Montgomery, Leanne Rimes, Lonestarand many more expressing significant interest in recording my songs. However, moving forward, it\\'s become clear that in order to compete with the best writers in the worldI am going to need to record my demos in a more professional way.The awesome news is Grammy Nominated producer Jim Salamone has agreed to oversee the production of a new CD project that will accomplish this. Jim has worked with top artists like Bon Jovi, Vanessa Williams, Teddy Pendergrass and he uses some of the top studio musicians in our industry....so we\\'re certainly in good hands.I hope you will consider helping make this happen by pre-purchasingthe CD or donating.So far my friends, family and fans have raised over $6,500 to help me pay for this ....but I still need to raise another $2,500.You can donate in any increment you want: $1....$5....$50...$100....$1,000 whatever you can afford would be a huge help. Love and Thanks, SolThis summer, my world got turned upside down: as most of you probably know, I was in Los Angeles this August shooting an independent film:And Then There Was EveI play Eve.It\\'s the proverbial \"left-turn at Albuquerque\" and one of those things that youignore at your peril and regret until the end of days.I love acting. It\\'s my favorite thing in the whole wide world, but... I thought that part of my life was done (I\\'d convinced myself that my acting career was the price I had to pay to transition, so I paid it). To fill that void I\\'ve been busy making other things like websites and photos and videos and just generally learning how to live and be creative in a small town in the Midwest and that all worked too. But...At the beginning of 2016 I was offered anArtist-in-Residency at The Refugehere in Appleton because I\\'ve been actively trying to figure out what my \"next\" was going to be.I thought it was going to be music but no, acting.Boom. I\\'m in a film.And now, I have a window of opportunity to re-invent my life in a very unexpected way... and I need to relocate to Los Angeles in Januarybecause thats where all of this happens. And I need some help to make that happen.(I\\'m not moving... I\\'m just makingroom for a bigger life)The Deal:I need about 10k to make 3 months in LA happen. I need to be there.The Refuge Artist-In-Residence Fund has given me a $5,000 matching grant.Which, because The Refuge is awesome, means every dollar you give is matched by them so hopefully at the end it means 10K.The plan is simple: take advantage of this opportunity and be a working artist again.$5,000 is my goal.If you\\'d like to get something in return for your cold, hard cash - which I totally get -then I can make pictures of you and yours. Really nice ones, too. I can make Headshots which are just useful as hell or, I can make Portraits which are, in my not so humble opinion, genuinely beautiful and basically my favorite things I\\'ve ever made outside of performance.Or, if you want to go nuts because you have this super cool idea... I\\'ll shoot it (if possible). Making pictures is one of my favorite things.Also, the holidays are upon us and older folks (I know a couple) like getting framed photos as presents. I\\'m not saying I\\'m gonna frame a photo of you for grandma, but I\\'m not saying I wont.Other than that... um, the satisfaction in being an advocate for me?But yeah, that\\'s it:I\\'m heading west to roll the dice (with a sensible plan and set of expectations because I\\'m almost a grown-up) and I need your help.Acting is the thing I\\'m supposed to do. I think it\\'s the thing I\\'m best at. And I know that I\\'m the most alive when acting is part of my day and now, because of this film and this, um, interesting world we live in...I have a chance. A shot.*:)The Backstory---New Years Day, 2016 A few hours after delivering a very large order of Kentucky Fried Chicken to an obviously hungover collection of bands and their loved ones (it was this lovely, communal gathering of likeminded, slightly-hungover souls ready to put on a show for each other... after a night of doing shows for other people), Cory Chisel offered me an Artist-in-Residency slot at The Refuge.**Thismeant that I would get a room. Of my own. At this former monastery where creative people were already making things. To realize a long-held dream of writing an albums worth of songs.I didn\\'t tell very many people about it.It was like this private place to explore the idea re-orienting my life to where I thought of myself as an artist first, and whatever my day job was second.It became this placeto dream again and to start exploring the idea of what my next was actually going to be. So I did. I showed up after a days work (with a side-trip to home to feed the cats) more often than not from March to July.And I started to make song-like things which were turning into an album and I thought that was going to be my next.(It\\'s still happening: \"Others\" - a collaborative album out in 2017 - Refuge produced-and-born. Holla!)Oh man, I loved that room and then the genie-in-the-bottle that is my acting career made a dash for escape and won.I got a leading role in an indie film.Aworld of opportunity I had thought long-gone all of a sudden opened up to me: I could act again! The world had grown up a lot while I\\'d been away and now transfolk are taking active action in being involved with the telling of our stories andI want to be a part of that.I can be a part of that.When I moved to Appleton I really tried to NOT talk about my acting career. It was both too complicated (you could see people go, \"Why did this lady play Henry V?\") and it was too hard to think about.It took something like becoming an Artist-in-Residence at The Refuge and the creative energy that is growing therethatme aware of the possibilities I had. The idea that I could be an artist first and foremost in my life rather than a hobby.And so I auditioned for a film almost as a lark, got the role, and changed the trajectory of my life.Now Im ready to take the next step.Thank god for KFC. ;)- End History (for now...)*Of course I went there. I also have no intention of wasting mine.**I cannot overstate how important The Refuge has been to me this year. That initial vote of confidence is foundational to my story.Hi! I am Zaida Johnson and I am a thirteen-year-old eighth grader from Portland, Oregon. I have been a dedicated dancer since I was four years old, and continue to work hard and train six days a week in order to achieve my dreams. I recently auditioned for the Alonzo King Lines Ballet summer intensive and am so proud to announce that I was accepted! This four week program in San Francisco runs from June 11th to July 8th. It will be my first summer intensive away from home, so I am asking for help with tuition, travel and other expenses. Anything raised past my goal will still be applied to AKLB, and the rest will be saved and put towards tuition and expenses for the other dance programs/workshops I am attending later this summer at Bodyvox and next summer (location to be determined).I am currently dancing for Bodyvoxs youth program, Junior Artist Generator (also known as JAG), and at daVinci Arts Middle School where my arts focus is dance.Before I came to daVinci, I was studying classical ballet at the School of Oregon Ballet Theatre. SOBT is the official training ground for Oregon Ballet Theatre, and offers chances to perform in productions with professional dancers. That is where I began my dance training and I studied there for nine years.The summer intensive at Alonzo King Lines Ballet is a diverse program that supports thegrowth of the contemporary ballet dancer, and valuesartistic risk-taking and independent thinking. I want tostep out of my comfort zone and explore new things that will challenge me, educate me, and help me expand my dancing tool belt. I really believe that the summer program at Alonzo King Lines Ballet could help me achieve this. Other goals of mine that I think the program can help me accomplish are to push myself, to take risks, and to be more independent as a dancer as well as a teenager. I want to explore, boost my creativity, and expand my dance education overall. I also hope to audition this year for the nationally known Jefferson Dance Program at Portlands Jefferson High School. I know that a lot of the dancers there have participated in programs at Alonzo King Lines, and I hope to add my name to that list. It would be a huge honor!The summer intensive at Alonzo King Lines is fairly expensive. Tuition, travel to and from San Francisco, and other expenses really add up. Just the tuition plus room and board is over $5000, and this does not include travel, supplies, or any other expenses. I was lucky enough to recieve partial help through a merit scholarship and a need based scholarship, but am still seeking help for the rest of the expenses through your donations. Money raised past my goal will still be applied towards AKLB, and the remainder will be put towards tuition and expenses of other dance programs I am attending later this summer at Bodyvox and next summer (location to be determined). I would be so grateful for any support that you could provide. Every little amount helps! Thank you so much for reading my story!In gratitude,ZaidaInfo about AKLSI: http://summer.linesballet.org/about/As friends, fans, and family of the Rumpke Mountain Boys youre very important to us. Each time we step onto a stage, we\\'re overwhelmed with your love and encouragement. Quite simply, you allow us to do what we do. Your support has allowed us to play thousands of shows and log countless miles traveling around the country to share our music from the shores of the Outerbanks to the Cascade Mountains in Oregon.  When we started as a band, we traveled around in a parade of cars and vans. The tides of 2012 beached the Sea Hag on our shores and she has been our trusted vessel ever since. As we prepare to embark on our next adventure, we have encountered a problem-- the Sea Hag is gently letting us know that she needs to retire.  Weve decided to launch Help theRumpke Mountain Boys Keep On Truckin. We are asking you for a contribution in any amount so the Sea Hag can take her leave and allow us to purchase a replacement.   In return we\\'ve come up with some extraordinary rewards. Thank you again for your support! We look forward to seeing soon.*Live Performance Rewards and any other miscellaneous items subject to terms and conditions as set forth here .Hey folks. Sadly I have to ask for help again. As you know I\\'m a disabled Veteran that lives a fixed income in the Bay Area which is very expensive. And it\\'s hard for me to ask for help directly but I have to do it in order to survive these days.So here I am asking for your help again. My clothing and bedding are literaly falling apart at the seams. My fridge is almost empty....I can\\'t even afford soap. I know everyone is hurting these days but if you can help I\\'d greatly appreciate it. Thanks.-Otto Von DangerSGT/USMC and Artist at LargeSemper FidelisOur daughter, Brooke Chapman, passed away on January 1, 2016 from complications related to pneumonia and her congenital heart defect (Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome). Brooke had many loves and interests including animals of all kinds, volunteering in her community, attending church, dancing, singing, traveling and painting, but her favorite thing to do was to be with her Elba High School Marching Tiger Band Family. Brooke played the trumpet and was a \"band nerd\" to the core. She dreamed of being the drum major one day and would stand on top of the goat house nearly every day directing her pygmy goats as she practiced her technique.Elba High School is a Title I school that is largely made up of children from low-income families. The band program is in need of many things, but our goal is torenovate the band room itself in memory of Brooke. At a minimum, the restrooms need an overhaul, the flooring needs to be replaced and the room needs fresh paint. We\\'d also like to build out trophy cabinets, risers and lockers for each student and add some murals to the space. If an excess of funds are raised, we\\'d also add in an acoustical ceiling and sound proofing panels to the walls.Brooke\\'s birthday was on July 18th, which is just twomonths away. We\\'d love to be able to raise all of the needed funds by then, but we know that is going to be difficult to achieve. If we don\\'t reach our goal in time, we will extend the campaign. Our goal is to have this project completed prior to school starting in August.We\\'ve thought of how we would like to give back to our community and build a lasting legacy in memory of Brooke for several months now, and think that this is the most fitting way that we can make a difference in the lives of Brooke\\'s friends that she was closet to. Thank you so much for your consideration of this project. If you are interested in donating materials or labor, please let us know.In 2010 we journeyed into the California desert and met Leonard Knight, the creator of Salvation Mountain. His story was so inspiring that we set out to make a documentary of it. We hosted a Kickstarter campaign to get Leonard a birthday present for his 80th birthday and we achieved that goal. Everything was going great until a few weeks later.\\n\\nLeonard\\'s health quickly deteriorated. His caretaker, Kevin, decided to take hime to an assisted care facility. Shortly thereafter, on December 15th, 2011, Kevin, passed away suddenly at a very young age. we were cut off from Leonard and Salvation Mountain. Due to a lot of politics, egos, and red tape created by a new board of directors we were unable to freely film at the mountain like kevin and Leonard had allowed us. On top of that, we never filmed our last interviews with Kevin or Leonard.On February 10th, 2014, Leonard Knight passed away. I feel as though it is nothing more than an honor to Leonard to return to the Mountain and finish this film. A testimony to who he was, his spirit, and his work.This is where I need to ask for your help. I need to fund raise in order to accomplish this and finish the film. These funds are to help cover the cost of travel (Detroit to California), Lodging, 2 days of filming at Salvation Mountain, and Post Production. Contributors will get a copy of the final film.\\n\\nOur goal is to get this film out there, into festivals, and share Leonard\\'s message of \"God is love, and his love is for everyone.\" to as many people as possible.Join artist, Alicia Beale, and producer, Mike Gossin, to become a part of her solo EP debut!Hi y\\'all! I\\'m Alicia Beale, and over the past six years, I\\'ve been working tirelessly to make a living as a singer and songwriter in Nashville, TN. I couldn\\'t have made it this far without all the supportI\\'ve received from family, friends, and fans alike; for that, I am truly grateful.I need your help one more time. Im working with a great friend of mine, Mike Gossin, part of the country music group, Gloriana. Together with other talented friends of ours weve written an albums worth of material. Mike believes in my vision for this music and wants to produce a radio-ready EP of the five best songs. Hes asked for personal favors from some of the very best in Nashville to save me tens of thousands of dollars in studio time, engineering, mixing, production, and musicians to name a few. However, no one works for free (or should ever be asked to). Every dollar we raise goes to those who are working hard to bring you my vision. We all have a dream. The dream is free. The hustle is sold separately. Thats why I need your help. A share or like on social media really does make a difference and so does any amount you may feel inspired to give. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I can\\'t wait for you to be part of this record and thisjourney.xoxo,AliciaSuede Austin Fans,Saturday night, May 17, Suede finished a show and had an unfortunate accident. Quite a bit of equipment was lost out of the bands vehicle. It wasn\\'t until the truck was half across town that the drivers were aware of this. Although the crew turned around to retrace their route, there was no sign of the equipment. The band was hopeful it would turn up in the next few days and has even offered a cash reward yet no one has come forward. This is the equipment that not only makes the Suede shows happen but, is how the band members make their living.Many fans have been asking how they can help so this site has been created for that. Please know the band is very appreciative of everyone\\'s offering and willingness to help. A benefit is also in the works. Please keep an eye out for details.Suede would like to sincerely thank you for your donation to help them replace the equipment that is gone.If you have any questions or would like to participate in the benefit please email: suededonations@gmail.comThank you.Hi!

Attending this event will present us the opportunity to take master classes at the world famous Broadway Dance Center with renowned dancers/instructors, including the world famous ROCKETTES!We are seeking donations from our friends, family and neighbors in order to defer the cost of the trip and allow all of the dancers to partake in this once in a lifetime opportunity!Hi! I am Shelya Paz...I left communist Cuba 15 years ago to live here in the United States with the love of my life, a songwriter. I always wanted to be in the media but the Cuban government decided I should be trained as a teacher, instead. When I arrived here my husband encouraged me to follow my passion. So, I am self-taught as a social media journalist . I have been covering stories for my site, Entertainment Circle Network, which is part of my small, but blossoming bilingual Paz Communications, Inc. production company. Fast forward to now: I have been fortunate to be contacted by the White House and invited to travel with President Obama to Cuba March 19th to March 22nd, 2016. So, time is of the essence. This is a great honor but with that comes the reality of the exhorbitant expenses. I am racing against the clock to make that plane on Saturday and cover all the costs.As you can imagine, I must pay all the expenses myself. It is not cheap to fly with the president. I will be with the President Obama as an eyewitness to events and give first hand accounts of how the United States and Cuba are reconnecting to hopefully reopen doors to allow the Cuban people more freedoms. This is a crucial story in the history of my beautiful and previous homeland, Cuba. And, now, my beautiful new homeland, the United States, is creating opportunities for those struggling in Cuba to perhaps achieve their dreams. The United Stateshas afforded tremendous opportunities to me for which I am deeply grateful and I hope the same will happen for the 11 million living in Cuba.The travel costs are exorbitant and beyond my reach. But, I feel so strongly about covering this eventful trip that I have raised half of what it will take to travel there with the White House Press Corps. This is a true honor and one that I want to share with everyone. I will be posting numerous stories, first hand accounts and talking to everyone and anyone who want information about the developing relationship between the two countries. Please follow me on Entertainment Circle Network and talk to me directly via YouTube ( https://www.youtube.com/user/EntertainementCircle),Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and on online at  www.ecircletv.comI am a struggling business woman who had a dream and it is coming true. Now, I have this great opportunity to share a historic event. Please help me as I need to raise another $7,000 to cover all the costs of travel, communications, hotel and accomodations. Everything is exhorbitantly high priced. I have reached out to numerous friends, family, sponsors and acquaintances who have helped but I have now reached the moment where, if I do not raise this money, I fear I will need to abandon my plans.I hope you feel this is as important as I do because I will bring you the news and information, unfiltered, and from the point of view of someone who has lived on both sides. I am extremely grateful to you for reading this post. I will continue to post stories and information about this journey and hope you will become a part of this amazing moment in time. Thank you so very much,Sheyla PazPaz Commuications, Inc.EntertainmentCircle - Facebook www.ecircletv.com@SPANISHTVNash- TwitterSpanishtvnashville - InstagramYouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/EntertainementCircleThe Townview \"Big D Band\" is embarking on a momentous occasion....twenty years of developing musicians and creating winners. The band is looking for alumni, friends, and family to donate to the purchasing of new instruments for \"The Storm\". Crowned the best drum line, both locally and nationally, these talented musicians are playing on instruments that are over 18 years old! The band has done half the work and now it\\'s time to do the rest! At this time 10,000 dollars has been raised and our goal is to match their contribution...and then some! For those alumni that remember the struggle to get uniforms we know you understand the importance of these donations. The band is not supported financially through DISD so it is up to us to make this happen.We are asking for donations to help purchase 32 new instruments for the percussion section, and any amount will help!! A receipt can be provided for any tax purposes!!Thank you SO MUCH for your support. I have been looking forward to this moment for as long as I can remember. It is my heart\\'s desire to bring healing to the nations though the musical giftings given to me my God. With your help, I will be able to make music that will draw people closer to God, and to each other. Music that brings folks TOGETHER from all walks of life, various ethnicities, denominations, and economic status. The time is NOW!! I am ready to LIVE on purpose, and IN my purpose, but I need your help. Any donation that you can give, will bring me closer and closer to my goal. No donation is too small.

There are 10 of us who collaborated on an animation project, which was accepted into the Disposable Film Festival in San Francisco, taking place in March 2014. We would like to go as a group to view our hard work at the festival premier. It would be a great opportunity for all of us to experience this. Visit our Facebook Page See our Video Thank you for your donations!We greatly appreciate it!00I have been accepted into the New England Center for Circus Arts Intensive Training Program in Vermont. I am one of only 18 students chosen nationwide (GO GUAM!) to participate in this program. In addition to tuition ($4600), I will be paying for travel, room, and board. I would appreciate any help in defraying these costs. Any donation is a big help. Guam has an amazing talent pool. Unfortunately, for me, I have to travel far from home to recognize mine. Running away with the circus isn\\'t as easy as it sounds. Thank you to all who are supporting me in realizing my dream.First of all I would like to make clear that what I am announcing here is the most difficult situation I have ever had to put into words in my entire life.In October of 2009 along with one of my best friends, and a group of talented artists that later became family, opened the doors to Cornerstone Art Gallery. A platform for Low Brow art, primarily supporting the Las Vegas Tattoo and Graffiti community.Cornerstone Art Gallery since has strived to be a staple in the Las Vegas underground art scene and has given 100\\'s of artists a place to call home. But today, December 30th after a single selfless act, that all has changed...This morning we received a call from a neighbor informing us that our door looked broken into. We rushed over to the gallery to find the door had been pried open, and with shock and devastation we walked into a 100% EMPTY GALLERY! The feeling of seeing every wall striped from originals works of art leaving only behind the description and price tags of artist\\'s hard work behind is the worse feeling I could ever imagine. To have every single item stolen as a gallery owner with the faith and trust of artists to house, support and sell their art is indescribable. I am devastated, disappointed and embarassed that this has happened. This last year has been a really rough year for Cornerstone Art Gallery and for many others within the Arts District, with the closing of both Reclaime and Black Bird Studios as evidence. Along with all the issues facing First Friday concerning funding, downsizing and ultimately an undisclosed hiatus of the event as a whole, has truly made a negative impact on business and the support from the community. All of this along with today\\'s discovery is most certainly the nail in the coffin and death to an era of low brow art provided by Cornerstone Art Gallery. I am unfamiliar with asking for help. I have never used this platform of crowd funding, nor had a legitimate reason until today. We are asking the community to give us a helping hand in replacing a fraction of the artists loss at Cornerstone. Every single penny will go to the five artists affected by this theft. The artists are as follows and in no particular order: Nina Navarette, Jason Gruda, Noel Terracina, Joe Riley and Visual Bluff. Both Dana Anderson and myself had artwork and personal items stolen from the gallery as well but again we are asking for support of the artist,s thousands of dollars in works of art stolen.We have tremendous faith in our community to provide a helping hand for these original artists in their time of need. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING (YOU) DO HELPS ALOT! We encourage if you are in the position to donate to please find it in your hearts to do so. In addition to donations, some very important supportive elements that will go a long way is by SHARING our posts, goFUNDme links, and information. Getting the word out is as important as doantions, so by simpling SHARING THIS INFORMATION< YOU ARE HELPING in a major way. Another key element in helping these artists is to continually check Craigslist, OfferUp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter for \"ART FOR SALE\". Take a moment and get mentally familiar with these works of art so if you see them again we can catch the thieves that did this.Again asking for help is something I am not familiar with, but I am desperate to do all that I can to help these people I genuinely love, admire and respect... The one thing i am familiar with is SUPPORT! These artists SUPPORT me while I SUPPORT them, so I am asking YOU to PLEASE SUPPORT MEMBERS OF (OUR) COMMUNITY.Sincerly,Phillip Limon(Owner of Cornerstone Art Gallery)Hello Family, Friends, and Supporters!WHO AM I?My name is Gigi Torres and I\\'m a Choreographer, Dance Educator, & Artistic Director based in LA.

The new album \"Kat Robichaud and The Darling Misfits\" is out and it\\'s time to really start promoting it. One of the most important and fun ways to promote an album is to create music videos. I created \"Somebody Call The Doctor\" by myself, and as much fun as it was to create, it took several months of my time, and now it\\'s time that I just don\\'t have because I\\'m writing new music, booking shows, and managing myself. It\\'s a lot of work, and I\\'d love to give an amazing videographer in the Bay area a chance to shine. I\\'ve been talking to several extremely talented videographers in the area, checking their rates, and listening to their ideas.\"A great visual travels,\" Amy Doyle (head of MTVs music and talent department) says.\"You can hear a song and like the song, but I really believe that a really great music video is a gateway to a musical experience you didn\\'t even know you wanted.\" Music videos increase awareness of an artist (it\\'s a face with a name), and it\\'s fantastic exposure. And the more exposure I have, the easier it will be for me to continue to create music for you AND it will help me get out on the road and tour.There are a lot of costs that go into making a music video. Beyond props, wardrobe, hiring a crew, a camera, lights, and actors, there are costs for editing, promotion, and distribution.Whatever we raise for the music video is what we will use. I\\'m all about quality over quantity.I plan on creating several music videos from the album. This GoFundMe will focus on one.And for helping with this video, your name will appear in the credits of the video. Contribute over $100 and I will give you a special shout-out at the end of the video!Thank you for continuing to believe in me, for supporting me, and aiding in creating music and art! I could not do this without you.xo,Kat Robichaudphoto bypetersamuels.com*STRETCH GOAL ANNOUNCED*I can\\'t believe that we\\'re three days in and we\\'ve reached 2/3 of our funding goal! I love you guys. You continue to blow me away. So let\\'s set a stretch goal because 1) the bigger the funding, the bigger the video and 2) stretch goals are fun. So if we passour initial goal, everyone who has contributed so far AND everyone who contributes afterwards will get a private individual special video message/thank you from me. If you\\'ve donated over $100 you will still be personally thanked at the end of the video AND your private individual video message will have me doing something silly/fun/weird for you (just as long as it is not sexual or puts me in harms way).Hi Everyone,My name is Hope Estelle Robinson and I am on a mission to make it back to Los Angeles to pursue my dreams to become a professional entertainer.I moved to LA in 2013 to serve as a role model, tutor, and mentor in an Urban MiddleSchoolthrough an organization called City Year. CYLA gave me many rewarding experiences, but amongst them,they rewarded me the opportunity to pursue my dreams as an actress and star in their 25th anniversary video thathas been viewed all around the country.\\n\\nWhen the program was over, I returned to my hometown of Detroit, MI for the summer to finish my dental work. However, I did not miss a beat! I have taught elementary dance classes as well as been involved in multiple creative projects by way of modeling and creative directing, choreographying, and dancing for a local musicians album release party.Now that the summer is over, my plan is to move back to LA and work as a substitute teacher by day and a bartender by night so I have the flexibility to continue my training, and audition for prospective dancing, modeling, and acting opportunities. I am scheduled to return at the end of November, and am currently raising money to get reestablished.Your support will be appreciated.

She was a source of inspiration to anyone who was blessed enough to be in her presence, and she had a heart of gold. Please donate anything you can to support her husband, children and family during their difficult time of bereavement. All proceeds will go directly to the family of Amy in their time of need.Like many high school performing arts programs, we lack funding. And there\\'s just so many hours in a day and only so many times you can sell wrapping paper and candy! We are a self-funded organization and are given no money from our district. All of our operating costs are paid through ticket sales, ads and boosters, apparel sales, and basic fundraising. This is our last resort as our account is in the red. We don\\'t overcharge for tickets and our show budgets are extremely tight, however, we are unable to stay afloat. Our season this year is \"Twelfth Night\" by William Shakespeare and CarrieThe Musical. While we are very excited about these shows, we are concerned because we have lights that need to be replaced, costumes that need to be repaired, set building equipment and tools that need to be purchased (we no longer have Woodshop classes!), and a multitude of other expenses. In addition to the above costs, we also provide 2 deserving seniors who have worked with us over the years with a monetary scholarship at our annual Senior Awards Night.Please help these students have a Theatrical Season to remember!!Heatwarmer has finished a new full length album. It\\'s all done! Recorded, mixed and mastered. We are using this crowdfunding campaign to help with the cost of manufacturing vinyl records. It will also help us know how many we should make. If you\\'d like one, you can consider this a way to pre-order them. $20 will cover the album and shipping in the USA$35 to ship to Canada$40 to ship internationallyIf you send us more or less than these amounts please include a statement explaining the amountWe\\'ll send them out to you before the release date in September or bring one to you on our summer tour. We probably won\\'t make too many more than the amount this campaign generates and what we think we can sell on tour, so if you know you\\'d like a premium quality 12\" vinyl record manufactured locally in the Pacific Northwest with artwork by Shana Cleveland and brand new songs by us,now is a great time to buy! THANKS!! <3p.s. the $1500 dollar goal is somewhat arbitrary. it would be nice to get that much! (or any amount!) but we wouldn\\'t cease production if we didn\\'t make that amount. It\\'s just that the site requires you to enter a number into the \"Goal\" fieldDear Friends,I\\'m happy to share that Part One of my recording project, the Trio CD with Misha Tsiganov on piano, Thomson Kneeland on upright bass and yours truly on guitars, arrangements and compositions, is well underway!My deepest thanks to everyone who donated their personal support and financial contributions so far. As a result, our trio sessions were fueled with inspiration, creativity and pretty relentless concentration. I\\'m so grateful to Misha and Thomson for their unwavering musicianship, professionalism and personal support. They infused the music with such warmth, excitement and precision, I will be excited to get to share it with you soon!The next step in the process will be to have the great engineer- David Darlington, edit, mix and digitally master the recording in early May. After that, I will seek out some new photos and artwork for the cover. Then I will research and implement the CD manufacturing (pressing and packaging).Part 2 of this big recording project is to make a solo guitar CD. To the people who know me predominately as a solo guitarist through You Tube, I\\'ve been eager to present all I have invested in my trio concept. For the people who have know me through my years of playing trio on Sundays at the Bar Next Door, and to the friends on You Tube who have asked about a solo disc, I\\'ve aspired to produce this solo project. I find solo playing to be the most demanding and intimate, therfore I will absolutely build on all the hard work and growth the trio session insisted on. I have plenty of new solo arrangements to share and will be eager to do so.With both inspiration and humility, I am continuing to raise funds for the solo project. To record, edit, mix, master, produce artwork and packaging for 2 CDs can easily cost $10K or more! I am happy to have reached an initial goal of over $6K and am aspiring to continue with your ongoing support.The solo session is scheduled for the end of May at Oktaven Audio in Westchester with another editing, mixing and mastering session to follow in the weeks after. Then I will aspire to repeat the post-production work needed to produce hard copies for CD 2/the solo CD (vs. releasing solely a digital download).With the help of my friends, colleagues and music lovers, I would be thrilled to see the 2 CDs recorded, mixed, mastered and printed as hard copies!Notice again, the incentives below, that I\\'ve created to inspire your support!My deepest thanks again for helping me move towards my goal!All the best!PeterGene and I decided to open Brass House while stationed in Afghanistan on our final deployment in 2012 with the Marines. We spent 30 days living in the space and renovating on a shoe string budget. Weopened with ten bottles on the shelf and $1,000 in the bankbutquickly became a neighborhood favorite. We expanded in just one year to the neighboring space adding a special events centerand full restaurant.  The operating cost were a little more than we calculated and while we trippled our gross sales in just one year, we were hit hard by the slow Austin summer months.  We are located in the best spot in Austin surrounded by over a dozen hotels and the Austin convention center. Business will pick back up in September and we will see a net income by December if we can just make it through the next few months.Unfortunately we are in danger of having to shut down due to a lack of operating capital. We must raise $25,000 of the requested funds by July 31st or be evicted by our landlord.My prayer is that someone will step forward and help uskeep this dream alive as we fight to save The Brass House.  Semper Fi, Jason & GeneHello friends and family! I am so excited to announce that I have qualified to compete in one of the most prestigious ballet competitions in the entire world, the Prix de Lausanne, in Switzerland. Only 80 young dancers from around the globe are invited to compete. I will proudly represent the United States of America as well as Puerto Rico!There are many incredible benefits to being a competitor in this competition. The potential scholarship opportunities would help me complete my ballet training in New York City or Europe. This training is essential to my artistic and technical development, which will eventually allow me to become a professional ballet dancer!   In order to make this trip a reality I will need the help of family, friends and ballet lovers! Your donations will assist my costs of travel, hotel stay, food, costumes, coaches travel expenses and training needed to compete. We are so very grateful for your donations. Please know that no donation is too small! You\\'re thoughts and support are just as important!I can\\'t wait to represent the Orlando Ballet School, the United States of America and Puerto Rico in February of 2015!Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your continued support!

Heart of Art\\'s Gallery is a safe space that nurtures a community who embraces the femininity and loving nature that gives these beautiful souls a voice and healing through art, workshops, and performances.On the evening of August 29th the Gallery was attacked. Two men from the surrounding neighborhood who had just harassed some of the attendees became aggressive and violent towards the crowd as well as the establishment. Bell and Kenia, founders and owners of HOA, ushered all guests inside and barricaded the doors with no hesitation. The police were called however during that wait for them to get here, we felt the walls shaking as they kicked the doors and destroyed the art outside.This incident was the last of present attacks on the space over the past several years and it has forced HOA to finally make the tough decision to close down and relocate.Bell and Kenia originally opened because a space such as this was needed; something that focused on empowering women, youth, and the LGBTQ community. Bell and Kenia wanted to reach out to people and let them know no matter what they are going through that there was a community of people who support them and support the fact that it is okay to be different.Through years of renting spaces to create awareness events for topics and issues that no one would talk about, such as femicide in Juarez Mexico and it became harder and harder for them to afford daily rentals, but their passions to create a space where women are the majority and their voices are heard drove them to create Heart of Art Gallery.It is of utmost importance that the idea behind Heart of Art has a home everybody is welcome and safe in and is why we have decided to start a Gofund Me; to get our next vision in motion and create a new space for the community. With the funds currently raised, Bell and Kenia have been able to move the entire contents and art from all the lovely contributors they have met over the years, but their work is not done yet and they are working hard to keep Heart of Art beating through these tough, dividing times.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.The Heart of Art family.heartofrtgalleryla.comIn 2009 the Edison Preparatory Orchestra program was on the verge of collapse. Nathan Greenwood, a young director, was hired to breathe new life into the program. The program started with 80 students in the middle school, many ready to leave if there wasn\\'t a tangible change, and 32 students in the high school. After five years of dedicated leadership and instruction, the Edison Preparatory has not only grown, but achieved at the highest levels. The program now has over 150 students enrolled in the middle school and 75 students enrolled in the high school.The 2013-14 school year marked the first ever Oklahoma Secondary Schools Activity Association (OSSAA) State Sweepstakes Award presented to theorchestrafor their accomplishments. This award is the highest honor that the state of Oklahoma can bestow upon a performing arts organization.In addition to their accomplishments at the state level, the orchestra was invited to perform at New York City\\'sfamed Carnegie Hall. Members of the Edison Preparatory Orchestra heartily accepted this invitation, and have been working to raise the funds to go. For each individual student the cost of this trip is $2000. This cost includes all travel costs, room and board, and all of the events scheduled on the trip.Edison Preparatory High School is a high performing school in Tulsa Public Schools. The school, however, is also a high poverty school with over 50% of its students on free and reduced lunch. Few students are able to afford private lessons for their instruments, and have been able to achieve at the highest level on their own individual merit coupled with daily instruction in class.Please help make a lifetime memory for these wonderful students. Help send us to Carnegie Hall!The total cost to send every student is $122,000.For your donations, large and small, you will be recognized in our concert programs for the year. All of the funds will be run through our Parent Booster Club, the Edison String Boosters, Inc.We are now trying to raise a little more money to scholarship students and offset incidental costs. In the short time we have left our goal is to reach $12,000. We are almost there! Please share!Thank you so much for your help in getting the word out to your friends! Remember: Every cent counts!The TSONS community has lost a special member. Mr. Art was not only a valued teacher, he was a loved friend, colleague and mentor. He will be missed. Please join in supporting his family through this difficult time.Update, August 17\\n\\nUpdate: August 9th, 2016\\n\\nReasons Julia Loves England, Video One\\n\\nTrailer for my film Out of PrintHallo! My name is Julia Marchese and I am a filmmaker currently living in LA.I recently completed my first film, a documentary feature called Out of Print, about the importance of independent cinemas & 35mm to culture. In the film I focused on The New Beverly Cinema in LA, my former employer, as well as The Prince Charles Cinema in London as twoexemplificationsof how special and different every cinema is and how each one cultivates their own unique, quirky community.Spreading awareness of how essential independent cinemas are is my life\\'s work, and I am ready to begin my next chapter.Out of Print was just chosen as one of the carefully selected titles included in Scalarama , an annual celebration of film each September in the UK inwhich a network of cinemas band together to share a touring program.I am so honored to have Out of Print play 5 dates during Scalarama - premiering at the Prince Charles! - and the theaters that are playing the film would love for me to tour with it, but the funds aren\\'tthere on their side or mine. That\\'s why I need your help.By donating, you are not onlypermittingme to tour with Out of Print during Scalarama, but also allowing me kick off my next project - a series of mini documentaries focusing on independent cinema around the globe.I will be shooting short videos at each cinema during this trip, focusing on that particular theater and allowing the patrons and employees of that cinema - the people who cherish it most - to speak for themselves and explain why that particular cinema issoimportant to them. Historically, it will be a time capsule of specific time and specific place, and will continue to spread awareness of what makes each cinema significant and precious.I will be bringing equipment with me and will record at as many cinemas in the UK as I can above the five at which Out of Print is playing during Scalarama.Specific travel dates and budget breakdown are below.

When they arrived back to their car they found that someone had broken a window and took all of their belongings. They lost items with costs ranging from clothing, luggage and prescription eyeglasses to kindles, ipads and laptops. The total estimated damages add up to approximately $5,000. A group of people in the comedy community have decided to join together to help this team recoup losses.The gentlemen of White Women have nothing to do with this gofundme, but will receive all profit made from it.This group has brought many smiles and much laughter to so many people.Personal belongings carry value beyond a monetary value. Shit happens! But here is one way that you can brighten things up in our comedy community.Hello! The Munford High School Marching band has received an invitation to participate in the 2015 Macy\\'s Day Thanksgiving Parade!This is once in a lifetime opportunity for our students. Munford is one of just six high schools invited to march in this event. We are proud to represent the Mid-South in New York City and we ask for you to help us reach our goal in order for the entire band to travel for this exciting event! Thank you for any amount that you are able to contribute! We love our students, town, state, and sponsors. We promise to make you proud!Hello Everyone! My name is Chris McNish and I need your help! I have an organization called Sweet Gap Productions. In a world where light and answers are not easily or abundantly found, it is the mission of Sweet Gap Productions to not only be a light and discover answers, but to reach out to the world through dramatic works. Our purpose is to use our creativity and passion to inspire, encourage, and entertain others with positive content using several platforms such as, skits, plays, interpretations, and film. In 2011, Sweet Gap Productions embarked into the film world. We create P.S.A.\\'s, commercials, promotionals, short documentaries, and short films.  We have touched many lives with our YouTube channel.  http://www.youtube.com/user/Sweetgap3 We are in need of equipment so that we can touch more lives and produce more professional products. We are looking to purchase a workstation, camera, lights, and software.  We are looking for donors!  This is how you can help. We are looking for 1 person to donate $15,000. Sounds crazy, right? Even though it can happen, we want to give everyone a chance to participate. If you send the link to at least 100 people and ask each person to do the same then that can increase the odds of people donating to the cause. For example, if we get 15,000 people to donate 1 dollar then we can reach our goal. If we get 5,000 people to give 3 dollars then we can reach our goal. If we get 1,000 people to give 15 dollars then we can reach our goal. Get the picture!There is power in numbers. Don\\'t put the stress on yourself. The video attached shows our passion. Send to all your friends that can identify with our cause. Let them decide! We have faith in you! Thank you for your help and remember: \"We Can Touch the World One Story at a Time\"It all began with a handshake. After winning several major awards at a university film festival, director and writer Mary-Madison Baldo turned from her friends to see an arm outstretched, awaiting a formal introduction. She then met the owner of said limb, a fellow director named Alex Bretow, who asked if they could work on a film project in the future. Their hands shook, phone numbers were exchanged, and a partnership was born. For two years, student filmmakers Madison and Alex have established their own independent film company by the name of BaldoBretow Pictures, and have created multiple short films, music videos, commercials, and features for assorted competitions, for business, or just for fun. Balancing school, work, and their company has proven difficult, but no matter what, they have taken on every obstacle and every challenge that the world has presented them and produced award-winning films.     One month ago, they applied for the elite opportunity to go to the Cannes Film Festival in France, where they could meet industry professionals and have their visual work shown on the silver screen in front of a gigantic audience. On March 16th, they were informed that they had both been chosen out of hundreds of applicants. They celebrated a day of extreme joy, but they soon realized that they did not have enough money to get to the festival not without help.      And this is where you come in. The full trip lasts for two weeks in May, from the 11th to the 25th, and Alex and I have done the math, resulting in our final calculation of $11,000. The first major deadline is on March 20th for $2800 dollars, a sum that secures our place in the festival. The second deadline is April 10th for the same amount, which finalizes our positions. The rest of the money is for airplane tickets, transportation within France, food, and hotel rooms. We really cannot accomplish our goal without your aid, and if you contribute to our cause, you will receive thank you notes, prizes, and other goodies for your assistance. As long as I can remember, I have wanted to share my stories with the world, and Alex feels the exact same way. This opportunity is a dream come true, as well as a massive step towards achieving our ultimate goal: to establish our company and market our films on the worlds most famous stage. Along with paying for school, supplies, and room and board, both Alex and I fund our projects out of our own pockets. We are fiercely dedicated to our craft because it makes us feel whole, alive, and effervescently happy. When we go to the Cannes Film Festival, we would meet fellow student filmmakers and high-profile professionals, making serious connections for our future. We will also see our films premiere to thousands of people that we have long admired and respected, which would be a proud and teary moment for the both of us.    We will be forever grateful to you for supporting us and helping us achieve our dream. Please donate what you can, share this link with your friends and family, and spread the word! Every contribution counts! Thank you for your attention and your time! Happy donating!This coming December brings upon a huge obstacle for my 16 year old brother. Born with a heart defect, Nicholas has been monitored his whole life. This past month after his latest testing, his cardiologists have determined that they need to replace the aortic valve in his heart, which means he will be having open heart surgery.\\n\\nNick is a big music lover. As a Junior in high school, Nick currently has a lead role in the High School Musical Sister Act. He is an amazing singer, participating in Chorale, Chamber Singers, & OffBeats, an acapella group that he is currently managing. He has taught himself how to play guitar. and is already working on a few of his own songs. Nick is also a baritone sax player, in both Jazz and Concert Band.\\n\\nNicks dream is to go to trade school to be an Auto Mechanic, and he pushes for that dream everyday. He isnt afraid to get his hands dirty and he almost always has a tool bag on his side and grease marks on his face.\\n\\nPlease help my family with upcoming expenses like doctors bills, co-pays, travel costs, and whatever else might occur. My mom will be taking time off from work to care for him at home after the surgery. Any support will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!Update: Many have been asking about what is going on with Nick Watts, so I will try to give you a little bit more information.Nick was born with what they call \"a mild valvular aortic stenosis with a mild regurgitation\", meaning that his aortic valve is thick and ridgy, and does not close properly. Therefore, he has a back flow of blood, \"regurgitation\", that pumps back into the left side of his heart. Two of his valves fused together or never separated during my pregnancy, so he has a bicuspid valve instead of a normal tricuspid valve.We knew at some point this would need to be fixed, but we didn\\'t expect it to be so soon. Nick has seen 3 different cardiologists since he was 2 weeks old, and at first, they thought he would make it to be 30-35 before anything would need to be done. Unfortunately, that is not the case for Nick. His heart and valves have changed pretty drastically over the last year and it needs to be fixed soon.His aortic valve has gotten much thicker, to the point of needing medication, and the regurgitation has become severe. Because of the regurgitation of the blood that is going back into the left side of his heart, the heart has become very enlarged on the left side. Imagine pouring a quart of milk into a quart sized container - it is the same volume, so it will easily fit. The back flow of blood in Nick\\'s heart is causing 1/2 of that quart to go back into the left side of the heart and then another quart is trying to pump through at the same time. This means that his heart has enlarged because it now needs to hold 1 1/2 quarts instead of the 1 quart, making his heart work harder than normal.Other than being more tired than usual, Nick has been symptom free and has been able to do most activities. The surgeon wants to do the surgery now, while he is young and healthy (besides the heart, of course), and is symptom free at this time. This should make for a quicker recovery time, as we know that kids bounce back much easier than us older people.He is scheduled to go for surgery the first week of December, with the hopes of being able to have the \"Ross\" procedure done. This surgery would mean that Nick would have no restrictions, no blood thinners, and would be able to do things that he has not been able to do for 16 years.There is a possibility that he will need to have a mechanical valve instead, that would require him to be on the blood thinners for the rest of his life, and he will still have the restrictions. We are praying that the Ross will work for him, but will not know until the surgeon gets in there.I will be taking a family medical leave of absence to care for him at home until he is healthy enough to go back to school. He will return a few hours at a time, as he is able, and I will tutor/home school him until he is back full time.We would appreciate all of your thoughts and prayers, thank you! <3Tammy Nick\\'s mom <3We want to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to read this, for sending thoughts and prayers, for donating, or just for sharing. Thank you! <3Hi, we\\'re the Modesto High School Band Boosters and we\\'re proud to introduce our newly appointed Band and Orchestra teacher at Modesto High School, Matt Cover. He is a proud Modesto High graduate from 1987! Modesto High was founded in 1883 and is the oldest High School in Modesto, CA. It has a rich and glorious history when it comes to music. The first conductor was Frank Mancini, a true \"Music Man\" to Modesto, CA. He was inducted into the National Band Associaition\\'sHall of Fame in 1994, bringing added prestige to our school and community.National Band Assoc. Hall of Fame - ManciniIf everyone who has ever played in a school band or orchestra, or anyone who sees the value in music education in schools gave $1-5,we would have more than enough money to start the revitialization process; repair instruments, pay additional travel expenses, pay entry fees for competitions and festivals... there\\'s just a lot of fundraising for our students to try to accomplish - and with your support we will be successful!My beloved student, Bethany Slomka, is a gifted SoCal based actor, singer, dancer, director, choreographer, and teacher.   She is the recipient of numerous awards and accolades for her work, and is universally lauded and loved by all who know her.  She also happens to be the greatest Tracy Turnblad the stage has known.   I would like to afford her the opportunity for the rest of the world to know this, too!NBC is holding an open call next month to cast the role of Tracy for thei r upcoming HAIRSPRAY LIVE!   The trip comes at a challenging time financially for my working actor girl....so I got to thinking....let\\'s DREAM BIG with her and send her there!  By my estimation, $1000.00 will cover airfare, two nights in a hotel, and cab to and from the airport, with perhaps a few bucks left over for some pizza and cheesecake!  I want Bethany to have what she so richly deserves--a chance!!!No gift is too small.  And know that Bethany will pay it forward.  She is just that kind of wonderful human being.Help Create the Sequelat www.gofundme.com/JourneytoLucidity2 Help share our story of awakening.

Sincerely, Brendon aka Skull Babylon www.ParadigmShiftCentral.com/SkullBabylonThank you for visiting my GoFundMe. I am a single mom with a pre-teen son. I recently lost a job that provided more than half my income. I also lost access to the space I was permitted to use to teach my music students. I now need to find or create other employment to replace the half of my income that I lost.I have a natural talent (and a lot of education and experience!) for teaching music students. Several of my former students have gone on to careers in music, and my current students range in age from four years old to people in their seventies. I also teach students with disabilities. The more I teach, the more I love it. I am interested in figuring out how each individual student thinks and approaches music. It is fascinating to watch my students learn and grow as musicians. Borrowing space is a risky proposition. If I lose the space, I sometimes lose students who do not want to move to a new venue. If I lose students, I lose much-needed income. I need a predictable place-my home- in which to teach, so that students do not have to adjust to new locations.Because of the expenses associated with being a single mom, I have not been able to afford to convert my living room into the studio I know it\\'s meant to be! The main thing I need, of course, is a piano. \"Free\" pianos, small poorly-made pianos, and older uncared-for pianos will not work for a professional approach. Students need an instrument that has a reliable action and produces the correct tone. I have changed the piano for the third time. This one is it! This is a gently used piano at a store near me. Very gently used! This costs the same as the P-22 I was interested in. The P-22 had a few problems, and when I thought about my beginning students- that type of problem can really put a damper on enthusiasm. I think beginners of any age notice that \"the key doesn\\'t work\" and think it has something to do with them, rather than the piano. I have heard from both young and old that \"I\\'m not doing it right!\" but the real problem is the piano\\'s faulty action. This instrument, a small Baldwin grand, will produce the range of tones a serious student needs to master; it is in excellent condition. I even got down on the floor under the piano to inspect it (don\\'t all potential piano buyers do this?!) :) It is also a piano that I can tune and do small repairs on myself, which will save me money that I can\\'t afford to spend. I have added $500 to the total, because I was told that the piano movers will charge this much. I am trying to find a mover for less, but this is not the sort of piano you can get your friends to strap in the back of a pickup truck! They will need to take the legs off to get it in the door and reassemble it.Please help fund this piano so I can start replacing my lost income. Thank you so much!Hello Crafters,You may know me from theawesome free YouTube video tutorials I share on my channel \"All Crafts Channel\"I love sharing my passion of crafts such as knitting, crocheting, sewing etc.  Being able to share my video tutorials is something that I hope brings value to others. Creating, editing and uploading video requires specialized equipment, long hours, and much sacrifice.  Up to now I have have using basic equipment.  I have uploaded over 600 free YouTube video tutorial to my channel \"All Crafts Channel\" Many other sites such as Craftsy, CreativeLIVE and other often sell the same type of classes I offer free on my YouTube channel. The majority of these projects are my own designs. I would like to be able to build my own home filming studio where I could have overhead lighting, more than one camera (I need a backup), video editing software, the ability to hire staff, and additional equipment I need so that I can add other tutorials such as sewing tutorials. I would also like to be able to have guests and do collaborations on my videos. Unfortunately at the moment I film out of a small bedroom in my home. I have a small overhead (PVC) frame where I hang my camera for overhead shots. It has worked so far but will not be adequate for the additional type of videos I would like to produce.  Building a home studio is a major feat. If I don\\'t receive financial assistance from my loyal viewers it will not be possible and I will be forced to limit the type of videos I can provide and the frequency with which I provide them.  I don\\'t want to leave YouTube as I love this platform. I hope you will consider donating to help make my home studio a reality. Any amount that you could donate would be a great help. Please consider donating today and allow me to continue making great videos for everyone. Creatively Yours, Yolanda Soto-Lopez'),\n",

       "  'My name is Miranda. I am a student at American University and I have a pretty big goal to achieve by November 30th. Do you want to help me reach it?Did you know the average American female will use 11,000 feminine hygiene products in her lifetime? That is about 250 products a year, and that doesn\\'t include other necessary items like pain relievers, cleansing soaps, and birth control. An articleby Jezebel breaks down how much it costs to have a vagina and came up with$2,663.02 per year. Costly for anyone, this total is manageablefor womenwith more financial resources. Unfortunately, where does this leave women currently experiencing homelessness?Women experiencing homelessness are a marginalized minority, and they are not always accurately represented in statistics on homelessness. A simple Google search doesn\\'t produce very much information, except for a startling fact : Washington, DCis home to the third highest poverty rate in the United States. If $2,663.02 only covers a woman\\'s feminine health annually, imagine how much more it takes to support other basic necessities, let alone an entire family?I know I am only one person andI know reproductive health is only one component of a whole person, but I also know women don\\'t deserve to be treated unfairly because of their gender or because of a bodily function they cannot control. If we come together as a community and a society to understand and support this issue, imagine what we can do!My goal is to raise $5,326.00 to put towards buying feminine products. I am also accepting donations of wrapped tampons and maxipads at American University. (Maxipads are currently preferred.) Tweet or comment below to arrange for pickup. The results of this project will benefit Thrive DC , a center in Washington, D.C. providing meals and resources to the area\\'s homeless.

Our community has asked me to set up Go Fund me Page to so that they can donate to help defray the costs of his going to Hawaii to attend the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Ed has a story to tell and he has been speaking to high schools and community groups for the last few years so that NO ONE will forget Pearl Harbor and the war he fought. Although not a Pearl Harbor Survivor Ed fought in 9 majpor battles including his ship being hit by a Japanese bomb and a kamikaze landing. Recently he used his own funds and flew to New Orleans to donate a flag that flew on his ship the USS Bennett DD-473. That flag survived the bomb and kamikaze attack at the Battles of Okinawa and Iwo Jima. While in Hawaii this year he will be speaking at an elementary school sharing his history.I am NOT asking for a lot of money - just some to help defray HIS costs -With that said I am THANKING the South Boston community and the South Boston community at large who have embraced my Dad and a true American HeroBecause of him and other veterans we have our freedomsI am Jake Decker and I am accepting donations for my Eagle ScoutProject.

(Photo by Ashton Kelley Photography)The Knowers are two of the kindest, most positive people you could ever meet. Sydney is a lifelong Howard County resident and grew up in Ellicott City. Sydney and Chuck met in college and got marrried in Westminster, Marylandexactly one week before historic flash flooding hit their neighborhood. Unfortunately, what should be the happiest time of their lives so far has turned into a nightmare. The Knower\\'s street after the floodingThis financial support will help the Knowers purchase a car and furniture. Sydney\\'s car was completely submerged in the flood and is not salvageable. The road outside the Knowers\\' apartment has caved in and will make it impossible for Sydney and Chuck to access the majority of their belongings any time soon. They will have to purchase replacement furniture and appliances as soon as possible.Please consider supporting these two wonderful people as they work on rebuilding the life that they just started together.

Good nutrition is a major part of healing the body and giving back helps heal the person as a whole. We will supply the garden area, the plants and equipment and the people in the programs will work the garden as a part of their recovery process.

Together we hope to empower individuals and the community to grow and become more prosperous!What is a modern volunteer fire department doing  in a historic trolley station?  Bursting at the seams, that\\'s what!How do the firefighters and EMTsmanage? They make the most of what they have. They are required to purchase custom or undersized equipment that fits into the old building, costing the village more for equipment and having to cut expenseson other needs. They mustrespondquickly to fight a fire, but a cramped stationcan cost critical delays.In 2014 alone, our firefighters and EMTs responded to 133calls in Saxtons River and surrounding areas. They rise to the challenge of working under difficult conditions. But they know they could do better, respond faster, save more lives, if they had a modern, fully functional fire station.We value our fire department. We are working hard to find ways to support them. Our little village of 565 people can\\'t build a new fire station on our own. We need your help to keep our village safe.Can you help us raise $800,000 to build and equip a new fire station for the 21st century?Please watch ourdetailed needs assessment video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX3jyHNUKOUThanks to: FACT TV, our fire chief, dedicated members of the Saxtons River Fire/Rescue and Jim McCaffrey for assisting with the creation of this video.Need another way to donate??Feel free to send a Check or Money Order payable to:Village of Saxtons RiverPO Box 243Saxtons River, VT. 05154Please put Fire Station Fund in the FOR line.What is legal, local singletrack worth to you?We\\'re looking to raise $8500. Fellow enthusiasts,A lot has happened sincewe founded this Chapter just over a year ago:- We secured permission to construct a Mountain Bike Loop in Blauvelt State Park. The trail is now at a point where we can consider it complete and ready to ride! Succeeding in this project opens the door for more access. - Weve been awarded an IMBA Trail Care Crew visit for early fall; more details to come.- Lots of work completed in Sterling Forest with the NY NJ Trail Conference this summer. We\\'re getting close to a 4 mile point-to-point trail being complete.- Several other proposals are in the works!We have basically been funding this effort out of pocket and with some help from our closest friends. It is now time to raise some funds so that we can continue our advocacy work in Rockland, Bergen & Orange Counties. Our goal of $8500 will be used to pay for some of our 2015 costs and cover the following expenses:IMBA Chapter membership for 2016:Membership has given us access to the legal, political and organizational advice weve needed in preparing our proposals. Annual Chapter membership is $500 and worth every penny.Insurance coverage for 2016:Not very exciting, but necessary to play ball. Annual Insurance is $1100.Proposals to state, county & town agencies:We have presented our proposals using professionally produced binders and sign boards. A typical Proposal is about $200.Chainsaw Safety Training:6 of us took a 16 hour course to become certified for power tool use in the State Parks. The course cost $1200.Trail building tools & supplies:We\\'ve been getting by with help from individuals and our friends at JORBA, but it\\'s time to make some purchases of our own. These tools will be used by the club to build, repair & maintain sustainable singletrack in our area. We have received a generous donation (valued at $1500) of premium custom made pint glasses to be used as thank you gifts. All donors will receive this set of 3 glasses, whether that donation is five bucks or five thousand.What is legal, local singletrack worth to you?Thanks for your continued support!Lorelai Burke is an 8 year old girl from Sheboygan that loves Harry Potter, swimming, being outside, and spending time with her friends. She loves horses, books and getting letters in the mail. Lorelai is also one of the strongest little girls, even though her bones are just the opposite. Lorelai has osteogenesis Imperfecta aka brittle bones. Her life is often unpredictable. Her bones could break just from the pressure of her standing up or the force of vomiting while she has the flu. Each break is different, different limitations and different pain. She has pain that is not even caused by the breaks at times, just bone pain. Lorelai has a wheelchair that she uses and is growing out of. Recently they went to see her special needs doctor to start the process to get a new wheelchair. One of conditions of her wheelchair being approved is her using it in the house. She will have to use her chair in the house as well as during her everyday life. Lorelai is almost 90 pounds, carrying her in and out of the house is very hard on her parents; therefore a wheelchair ramp is needed. The Burkes have applied for funds from the state and to everyones surprise, including the doctors, they have been denied twice. Her parents have tried several different approaches, grants, groups, etc. With each denial, their hopes have slowly been depleted.Over the past couple of months, we have been working with Home Depot in Sheboygan to work with their vendors to get us a plan and materials, at cost, to build the ramp. In addition, when we had builders out doing the measurements and figuring out a way to do the ramp, the driveway space came up. With how the ramp will go, this cuts into the driveway space. If the family leaves it as is, its a tight fit to get the van into the drive way and be able to get out and such. The funds that are raised will go for these materials as well, along with any permits needed for the projects. This is not a matter of a cosmetic enhancement to the house, but a daily functionality of this childs life. We would love to give this gift to them with your help!Thank youJesse The Walking Man Turner is walking from Connecticut to Washington DC this summer to protest the education malpractice that is demoralizing parents, teachers, and turning our children into human capital.I\\'ll start walking in June, time it to reach Washington DC for the BAT\\'s National Congress July, (400 miles in 40 days)I\\'ll post my itinerary in February. I will hold Walking Man Events along the way in people\\'s homes, libraries, coffee shops, churches, and on street corners, to gather evidence from parents, students, and teachers.Why walk?1. I am a Professor of literacy, I have a Ph.D in Language, Reading, and Culture. Everything I know professionally informs me what is happening to our children in the name of education reform is child abuse.2. Because Moses walked, because the Cherokee Walked, because the Navajo walked, because Martin Walked, and because Cesar Chavez walked. Walking may just be the most potent weapon human beings have against oppression.3. Because childhood matters.4. Because children come first.5.Becasue someone has to tell our nation\\'s leaders our children, their teachers and local schools are more than test scores.\\n\\nThis is a grassroots campaign to connect the dots across states and bring awareness to the testing abuse that is demoralizing children and their teachers. My estimate is the walk will cost me 6000.00. I am willing contributing 3000 of my own money to my walk. My hope is to raise 3000 dollars the other half of the cost.I\\'m a psychotherapist by training. By circumstance I\\'m an author, whistleblower, and human rights advocate. I wrote a book calledGETTING AWAY WITH MURDER;anon-fiction narrative that detailsthe nearlythree years I worked in a psychiatricwardat the Dade Correctional Institution, aFlorida state prison. Patients were tormented, beaten, tortured, and in the case of Darren Rainey, killed by correctional officers. My bookisavailable onCreateSpaceandAmazon.In mid-May 2014, I came forward in a Miami Herald articleentitled,Former workers describe \\'chronic\\' torture.As far as I know, I\\'m the only mental health professionalwho has openly spoken about the rampantbrutalitywithin the Florida Department of Corrections. Since the Herald story broke, I\\'ve become a full-timehuman rights activist and mental health advocate. Sadly, mental illness has become a crime punishable by death and imprisonment. For lack of funding, state and community mental health facilities have shut down resulting in the mentally ill being swept up into the criminal justice system. Your funding will greatly assist in my efforts to make a difference for the men and women who have no voice. My strategy is two-fold: 1)Continue my efforts to increase public awareness of prison brutality in the Florida Department of Corrections. I\\'ve worked hard to get the message out inFlorida and want to take it to the national level.My activism has included: Presenting before the Criminal Justice Committee in Tallahassee. Appearing on TVandRadioshows. Giving interviews toreporters - the Miami Herald has published over 70 articles covering abuses, corruption, and murder in prisons throughout Florida.2) Promote my book through book tours, radio and TV appearances, speaking engagements, and lectures to students in Criminal Justice Programs and Law Schools. I plan to hire a publicist to help me promote my book as well as schedulingbook signing events. I have beeninterviewed by a journalist for The NewYorker Magazine. The article is scheduled for a fall issue.I\\'m very active and dedicated to change. My typical week, which often spills over into the weekend, has me speaking to legislators, counseling people with loved ones on the inside, updating my website, networking, and writing essays and blogs. I recently spoke to new DOC Secretary Julie Jones. That\\'s the short list!I\\'m currently mobilizing a grass-roots effort to convince Florida lawmakers to adopt the strongest possible prison reform bill to combat a cancerous culture of secrecy, brutality, and retaliation that is at the core of the FL DOC.

It is registered on the National Registry of Historic Buildings and is the oldest continuously active synagogue in Dauphin County which includes Harrisburgthe capitol of Pennsylvania.The building is 109 years old and the steps and facade are in need of repair, which is very costly.

Did you know that there are over 8,000 children being raised by their grandparents (and great grandparents) in Brevard County, Florida alone? This is happening all over America.I can assure you this was not in the \"plan\" for these grandparents, but life sometimes throws us a curve ball. Drug abuse and domestic violence are two of the biggest reasons for this epidemic, but sometimes it is due to illness or death of the parent. Regardless of the reason, these childrenneed a place to call home that is safe and stable, and as you can tell by the news, they are often placed with relatives (typically grandparents). Grandparents Raising Grandchildren of Brevard County, Florida, Inc. (GRG) provides resources for these grandparents who don\\'t know where else to turn in this time of family crisis. In order to accomplish their important goal of \"The Child First\", GRG offers training courses, referral services, legal direction and funding, events for the kids, and most importantly support groups. There are pitfalls at every turn. For example, grandparents cannot even enroll the grandchildren in schools, daycare, or take them to the doctors and dentist without some form of guardianship or legal paperwork. Guardianship, Custody or Adoption requires legal representation and most of the grandparents that reach out to the GRG cannot afford these expenses. GRG provides funding for initial consultation and additional assistance with legal fees when it has the funding available. In this past year, the amount of services needed by grandparents seems to have skyrocketed. GRG does a phenomenal job with what they have, but like every non-profit agency, they need more. Give generously and help this group so the children can be legally protected in their new homes!Taxpayers are saved thousands of dollars in the long run when these children are kept out of foster homes. I am a \"card carrying member\" of this organization and have adopted two grandsons. I have witnessed first hand the wonderful job this organization does for the very needy and often terrified grandparent that walk through their door looking for guidance. Just imagine how different raising these children will be for these grandparents compared to when they raised their own children. Times are so different. Technology is overwhelming. The grandparents should be applauded for stepping in to take on this monumental job. They need our help and I am counting on you all to step up in whatever way you can. Every little bit will add up and your donations are tax deductible!If you were to poll your friends or coworkers, you would find that everyone knows someone who was raised by one or both of their grandparents. The need is real, and the need is great. These grandparents must be helped atthe most basic starting point, which is the obtaining of legal documentation so they can properly care for these children. GRG of Brevard is working tirelessly to not only help the local grandparents with this difficult job, but they are also working to change legislation to provide safe and stable homes for the children!Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and forconsidering helping out!SAVE MAD MODERN! Cedar Rapids, Iowa just experienced its second worst flood event in recorded history. Many homes and businesses were saved by a temporary flood wall that was quickly constructed through the heart of the city. Unfortunately, some locations were not behind the safety of the barrier due to engineering requirements and they are now left to salvage what they can, muck out their buildings, and start over.One of those businesses is Mad Modern and I am calling on the community to help by making a contribution that will go directly towards reopening Mad Modern ASAP. Mad Modern is a family-owned business in the NewBo neighborhood that specializes in vintage midcentury furniture and interiors. If youve stopped by the shop then you know what a treasure Mad Modern is. Dave, the owner, is a personal friend and Ive been a customer since they opened 6 years ago. Really, you couldnt ask for a better example of what makes NewBo the Bohemian capital of Iowa. Please, lets all help them shout out OPEN FOR BUSINESS! Crowdfunding will be the fastest avenue to help them stay afloat (pun intended) during this difficult time. They will appreciate every penny and knowing that so many people have their backs. Thank you for your help in sharing this request widely and for making a contribution. It takes a village! Peace and love. https://www.facebook.com/MadModern/aboutA little about me, my name is April Mead, and I\\'m a former longtime resident of Cedar Rapids. I put this campaign together because Dave would never ask for contributions because he is humble. I can\\'t think of a more deserving person and business. He will be ever so gratious and may even be so kind as to throw a party in the parking lot in the future (I\\'ll provide the beer & it won\\'t be that cheap stuff he likes)!One final note, for transparency, these funds will only be withdrawn by Dave Owens, owner of Mad Modern. On behalf of Dave and his family, thank you for your generosity!I am Lizz Goins-Turner, a native of Winston- Salem, NC & I am currently in the process of purchasing & restoring the old Ritz Theater located at 2014 Greenway Avenue Winston-Salem, NC.

We write, direct & produce stage plays on a national level which have debut in Florida, North Carolina, Mississippi, Indiana, District of Columbia & New York but Winston- Salem, NC is home for me.My heart\\'s desire is to re-open the old Ritz Theater which was originally opened in 1968 but has been left sitting for quite some time now. The building is in desperate need of restoration inside & outside in order to bring it up to code. The theater was a place where many residents would visit to watch their favorite movies & I am planning on doing everything within my power to re-open it This theater will be a venue which will be set up for live shows such as stage plays, concerts, poetry readings & comedy shows as well as big screen viewings of independent artist movies. This is a huge piece of history which needs to be restored for the simple fact that we are known as the City of Arts. With your help & the City of WS, I know that we can make this happen. Restoring history, designing jobs & providing an elegant platform is our goal.Thank you for your support & I pray that God will answer every one of your needs.

But this isn\\'t for me. My good friend Brandy has been a single mom of 3 girls for awhile now. All three are in elementary school.  She is active in the community and always helps others when she can.  She plays a vital part in helping young girls learn and grow through Girl Scouts. Through no fault of her own, she is about to lose her house.  She has tried multiple times to ask for assistance through the state. However, she keeps getting doors shut in her face, again and again. If she does not pay the mortgsge up to date of $12,000 by the end of the month, they will auction off her house and anything else she has ro collect. This would leave her, and her 3 girls out on the street. We can\\'t let that happen!! She continues to try every avenue for assistance and work, but her and her 3 girls need our help!! Please help in any way you can!! It is all appreciated and whatever she gets will be used for her girls and the house.

Hundreds of shackles, manacles, branding irons and other forms of ironware are displayed throughout. Numerous Bill of Sale documents reveal how slaves were bought and sold like chattel property are on display. Also included, are a significant number of Jim Crow objects purposely created to negatively depict Negroes and further fan the fires of bigotry that led to lasting racist attitudes toward African Americans today. Several exhibits ranging from the capture of Africans to the emancipation of African Americans and the contributions they made in the building of America are included in the guided tours. This small-sized museum contains a huge amount of history not generally found in many history books raises visitors\\' level of consciousness and awareness. The exclusive LWF \"Killed by Others - Killed by Brothers\" exhibit provides a direct and disturbing correlation between violence dealt to blacks by others during and post slavery with the genocidal killings currently affecting many black communities by brothers today. LWF slavery museum reveals a dark and tragic period in American history while also shedding a positive light of understanding the value of this historic period and the knowledge it provides. The horrendous winter of 2013 wreaked havoc on the 18,000 square foot building which houses the 3,500 square foot LWF museum. As a result we are desperately in need of a new roof, electrical work and general repairs. Without the much needed funding LWF museum is in jeopardy of going away along with the display of rare artifacts and valuable knowledge we provide. Not only will the funding enable us to replace the roof and do other desperatelyneeded repair work to our building; a1950\\'s former rubber gasket factory, we will also be able to expand ourmuseum space and exhibit even more of ourgarnered collectibles and artifacts presently in storage. Without financial support we will be forced to close our doors indefinitely.Any amount of donation will be greatly appreciated and utilized as previously mentioned. We thank you for your consideration of our plea for financial assistance and hope that you will find our labor of love and gift of knowledge to the general public one worthy of your support.

I am Clifton Perry, also known as \"Mr. CliffNote. I am a native resident of Detroit, and current tenant of Northland Mall  until April 1. Along with all my fellow displaced business owners, the fate of a special piece of my art hangs uncertain.This campaign is to save that art  a Motown-themed mural I did that stands 16-feet tall by45-feet wide. It features some of the most popular acts on the legendary Motwon record label - a label that helped catapult Detroits unique music around the globe. Im also a music man, and put five months of time and energy into creating this piece, to properly honor the legend it represents.Schools have scheduled field trips to the mall just to see it, and I\\'ve even had a visit from the last surviving member of the Four Tops, Duke Fakir. I was humbled to hear Fakir say he came because he had heard so many great things about it.I created the piece so people could have a visual representation of the historical significance that Motown is to this city and state. Motown smashed walls and made history, but seeing this piece get smashed or painted over would be a tragedy.If there\\'s anything in my power that I can do to stop this from happening, Im gonna to do it. But with limiting funding and a ticking clock, I need support to save the mural. I\\'m reaching out to anybody or any institution who might be willing to help me get this mural out of the mall before it closes.I am hoping to get it placed into a museum, art gallery, or even with a private collector for personal display. Funds raised will go toward moving costs.Please help this historical piece live on like the timeless music it represents. Any assistance is greatly appreciated! I thank you so much for stopping by and reading about the Motown mural and the story behind it.

Thank you so much, mainly for your prayers and most definitely for your support!!Please help repair the Brigadoon sign. Our sign was destroyed by a hit and run driver. The estimate to rebuild the sign is $5000.00 with your donation we can rebuild, but without donations this is not possible.We have 1750 homes in Brigadoon if everyone donates a little we can replace the entranceway sign. It breaks my heart to see such damage. Wish they would have made an arrest. Then at least we could go after the ones that caused the damage.This GoFundMe page is something I have decided to start for one of my employees, Thomas Loy Jr. I work at Monoflo International in Winchester and learned a story today about him that made me deeply upset..and pretty damn angry. I went to facebook with my thoughts about it and some people reacted and are wanting to help out. Please read below for the facebook story. If you have any questions for me pleasecontact me through this website.If you would like to stop by and meet Thomas (someone who will absolutely inspire you by his hard work and life story) let me know and I will set it up. The funds will be given to Thomas not only to help him get on his feet with a vehicle but also from all of us who donate as a \"thanks\" for setting a standard as someone who works hard, everyday, no matter the circumstances presented. I have very much respect for this individual and hope I can just help him just enough to put a smile back on his face and get him headed in the upward direction. Him and his wife live in a motel on Valley Avewhile he gives as much as he can to his mother to help her renovate her house. For about a year now Thomas has sacraficed his living conditions so that he can help his mother get her house back to livable conditions.Posted 08/08/16 on Facebook:I want to share something with you all. I have an employee that walks to and from work everyday. He lives on Valley Ave near Jim Stutzman Chevy and reports to work in the Stonewall industrial park in Stephenson(north Winchester) at 8am every morning. This individual then leaves here at 4:30pm and heads over to his second job at Home Depot warehouse to be there at 6pm. He works there until midnight and then begins his trek home back to Valley Ave. This is nearly 12 miles round trip and the walking part takes almost 5 hours total. This is a man that doesnt complain, just does what he has to do because he has no other choice. Does his job as well as anyone and works very hard...A very respectful but timid person. The one who always stands up to lend an extra hand when others just walk away.Last Thursday night he was homeward bound at 12:00am from his second job. Around 12:30am he had just crossed thru the Loudoun Street mall and was headed south bound towards Valley Ave. He got one block south of the old town mall when he was hit with a metal trash can in the back of the head. A black male individual 22-24 years old told him \" I know you, give me your wallet..\" My employee put up a fight for as long as he could until a second individual popped out of a bush and sucker punched him in the side of the face knocking him out. By the good Lords graces, they didnt get his wallet and didnt severely injure him. Let me mention that the next morning, Thomas was at work at 7:45am, ready to go. I was not around much Friday to notice his swollen face.This morning (Monday) I mentioned something and learned the story of what happen. Its hard to keep my rage in. To see someone work so hard...and be beaten for what theyve earned by working. Sickening.He mentioned to me he was not interested in the trouble of getting the police involved as he will let God decide the fate of the 2 men who did this to him.For those of you who have kids in town that walk to and from school, you probably know Terry the crossing guard. He is so sweet and completely dedicated to our kids safety. He never misses a day because he wants to be there for our kids. Last week, Terry\\'s car broke down. He needs to get his transmission repaired at the cost of $3000! He has been borrowing his sister\\'s car just so he can keep coming to work to keep our kids safe. He has a mother in her 90\\'s in Florida who he tries to visit every year for Christmas, and might not be able to go because he has to pay for his car. Let\\'s show Terry how greatful we are for his dedication by pulling together as a community and helping him out this holiday season.Some of you might have given him a card and little gift, but this is the gift he really needs. Thanks for your help!In October 2011, Antonio Anthony was killed by gun violence in the Flint Community. This sparked something in Kala Santrese; she knew that she had to do something. Antonio was her brother. He was an artist and aspiring fashion designer. She then made up in her mind that she would do what she knew to help others in the community to expose them to things they could only dream of. Kala wanted to inspire them to go after their dreams. As a result, Fashion Against Violence was created. The Fashion Against Violence movement created\\na program for the youth in the Flint community called Fashioned with Purpose (FWP) in\\n2011. FWP is a program focused on developing the skills of individuals\\ninterested in Fashion and Art in urban communities. Our mission is to promote\\ndesigners and artists who thirst for opportunities in hopes to educate the\\ncommunity through exposure to the fashion industry.\\nIn 2013, Vehicle City Fashion Week gave Fashioned\\nWith Purpose a platform to educate and illustrate to individuals ages 12-18.\\nThese individuals were given the opportunity to learn basic fashion skills that\\npositively changed the way they present themselves in the world today. They learned\\neverything from proper undergarments with Victoria\\'s Secret Stores, to how to\\nuniquely dress for life with President Tuxedo Stores. This program taught the\\nstudents how to confidently incorporate their individual style to fit into the\\nworld of everyday living. There was however one requirement for program\\nparticipation; all participants had to write a brief essay on how violence had\\naffected them directly. \\nStudents not only expressed how violence\\nhad played a role in their lives, but they also learned how their dreams paired\\nwith ambition could allow them to conquer various career opportunities in the\\nfashion industry. They were also given the opportunity to attend the Vehicle\\nCity Fashion Week Runway Show and worked with professionals in the industry to\\nproduce an actual design showcase. This program will prepare the youth in the\\ncommunity with skills and internship opportunities that can be used in their\\nfuture careers. This year we look to take this opportunity to New York City for\\nreal time experience in America\\'s fashion capitol and we need you to accomplish\\nthis goal. \\nIn February 2014, we plan to take two young women from Flint, MI to New York City to attend\\nMercedes-Benz Fashion Week (Alexis Harvey and Alexis Neal). We know that two individuals is not a large number,\\nbut this is just the start of what will become a grand opportunity for youth in\\nour community. We ask that you help us to reach our goal of $2,000 so that we\\ncan expand our exposure for the Fashion Against Violence Movement.On behalf of the community of Pecan Grove, Texas, I have to share the storyabout a citizen in our community - who took the time to help afellow citizen, for no reason other than it was the right thing to do.Please meet my husband.One Act of Random Kindness Can Change the World...\"A couple of weeks ago Officer Petty answered a call about a welfare concern. When he arrived he found a single father trying to take care of his young teenage children. There was nothing wrong with the father, or the kids, other than they just did not have a lot of material goods. Officer Petty found that the father was sleeping on the floor while the kids were sharing one mattress. Officer Petty spent some time talking to the father and learned that he is trying to find a job in this area so that he can get on his feet and off of assistance. Officer Petty decided to help this family out. On his day offhebrought the family an air mattress and a regular mattress from his home gave it to the family. He also bought them new sheets and pillows. He gave the kids an X-box that he no longer used and bought them a TV and an extra controller so they would have something to do while at home. He later learned that the family did not have a working TV and the one he bought for them is the only one they have. Now Officer Petty is working on getting the kids the school supplies that they will need to start the school year with.Officer Petty was not the one who told us about this. We received this information from an anonymous person. When asked about it Officer Petty told us the story. We asked him if he wanted help with the family but so far he has not asked for any. We wanted to share this with all of you. Officer Petty is showing all of us that being a police officer is about caring for the community you serve in and helping people when they need it. We want to commend Officer Petty for his selfless actions and for his commitment to help those in need. Thank you Officer Petty.\" -Richmond (Texas) Police Department Family, friends, and neighbors have asked how they can help. We are working with the family to fulfill specific needs like pots and pans, towels, general houseware items like cleaning soap, etc. If you have any items that you can donate - like furniture, household items, etc, please contact us. Or please consider contributingany amount, large or small. Proceeds will directly benefit the family and purchase any necessities. After the specific needs are fulfilled, the remaining donations will be given to a charity in the Richmond, Texas area.Thank you so much for your support and generousity.#PayItForward.A year of contemplation brought me to the realization that I must domy part to reduce the impact of commercial food production on the earth, and to feed my children a healthier diet of whole, local, organic, and natural foods. The intention is to practice self-sustaining farming. The idea is to produce natural and unprocessed foods for my family and the local market, and In the process, to teach my children where their food comes from and make as little impact as possible on an already stressed-out planet. Iam reaching out for your help to make this a reality.The farmhouse, barns, and out buildings on our farm in Kentucky need a complete overhaul. Your support will help make this vision a reality. Thank you.With Love and Light,TedMy self and other good samaritans are seeking help for a hispanic man and his child, who does not have a vehicle yet goes from door to door on their bikes hauling all his tools. Asking if any services are needed. From mowing lawns, painting, welding, cement, you name it he does it. As they work around the neighboorhood they also collect cans. This man is not only making an honest living but also teaching his son that nothing is impossible, especially when it comes to taking care of your family. We are all guilty of making excuses as to not getting things done. As I witness this man and his son working in a 100 degree weather with out hesitation but rather content to have been blessed with a yes! Makes me feel the need to put this campaign together for him to help get him a vehicle. This man deserves blessings. He like many other immigrants is just trying to make an honest living to provide for their families. Now if we help him with a vehicle he will be able to seek more jobs.  Anything helps please find it in your heart to make a donation thank you.Greetings Welcomed Reader,My name is Cullen Tiernan. I\\'m an Iraq War Veteran, a UVA graduate, a Bernie Sanders Delegate and now a candidate for Fremont California\\'s City Council.It\\'s been an amazing experience getting politically active with hundreds of people across the country who support Bernie\\'s vision for a better future. That\\'s why I\\'m running, to keep his messages, his values and our revolution going full steam. Together, we can vastly improve the quality of life for the people of Fremont, and we can become the model for the rest of the country.My recent experiences at theDemocratic National Convention made me realize how quickly we need to move to start transforming our country. The political establishment is sincerenly working to silence our voices and we can counter that effort by getting even more engaged. In order to conduct a succesful run for City Council we need to have all our paperwork together by August 12 along with $3600 to file a \"candidate statement\" with the official city paperwork.We are going to work like hell to get that done and any and all support you can send will be greatly appreciated.Also, please reach out to me with your address and I will send you a personally written thank you card. All of us in East Bay will be eternally grateful for your support and I plan on live streaming the process so that we can share information with you in real time and help design a blue print for furthering our revolution!All of Us Together,CullenWhat?

Not withstanding their denial, the South Sudanese Army burned and looted the village where members of myextended family live, because they resisted the incursion of armed Dinka herdsmen into their land. We have not been in contact with our familybecause they have fled into the mountains, and the government soldiers knocked over and burned the local cellphone tower.This atrocity happened despite the current peace accord the army has signed on to.At the beginning of this summer students from Wesleyan University and the University of Vermontreceived funding to build a women\\'s maternity clinic in the village. However,our hopes for the village are put on hold by this recent illegal attack by the South Sudanese Government.The Moru have been peaceful and uninvolved in disputes between the northern tribes; and now the army is bringing their atrocious war to Equatoria.It is currently estimated that over 1,000 families are hiding in the jungle to protect themselves from the army.\\n\\nToday I am asking YOU to raise funds for the people of Mundri Western Equatoria so that when come out of hiding, they can afford to rebuild their homes, afford to buy blankets and bedding that was stolen, and most importantly, so they can afford to buy food.\\n\\nThe following pictures are pictures of the children from Buagji, including a picture of me with my cousins, as well as a picture of some of the school children during a school meeting we held.I will be posting updates as my family receives them from the family we have in the capital city of South Sudan, Juba.

The funds will only be distributed when the situation becomes more stable. I will be visiting South Sudan in December and will be happy to share pictures of how the community benefits from this fundraiser.This is the same foundation that we have been working with to build a maternity clinic in Western Equatoria.\"Shoot Hoops Not Guns\"Over the past school year three 7th graders from Frazier International Magnet School in Chicago, Charles, Michael, & Semaj, were paired up with mentors Corey Jarrett, Kevin Beaudette, & Steven Galanis from LinkedIn Chicago through the Spark Program. The students and mentors metfor two hours each Wednesday at the LinkedIn Chicago office. At the conclusion of their year-long mentorship the students werecharged with designing a project to presentat Spark Chicago Discovery Day (3:00-5:00pm on June 10th, 2016 at Daley Plaza in Chicago, IL, USA).For their project, the boyswanted to build awareness aboutthe growing problem of gun violence against inter-city youth in Chicago by designing a t-shirt that reads, \"Shoot Hoops Not Guns.\" Proceeds from the sales of these t-shirts will be donated to local Chicago charities aimed at protecting the city\\'s youth and giving them safe places to play.The purpose of this site is to fund thecosts of creating this t-shirt so the boys can sell themat Spark Chicago Discovery Day. Thank you so much for your consideration and for visiting our site!Meet the Squad - Semaj, Michael, & Charles\\n\\nMichael M.My name is Michael and I\\'m a 7th grader at Frazier International Magnet School particpating in Spark. I am trying to make t-shirts because I believe that it will help end gun violence against kids in Chicago. I care about this so much because I lost my brother to gun violence last year. I hope no one else will have to lose someone close to them because of gun violence. I will try to get these shirts out by June 10th, 2016 and display them at the Daley Center Plaza in Chicago as part of the Spark Discovery Day, but I can only display them if I get donations. That is why I am asking you to donate!Charles D.Hi myname is Charles and I am also a 7th grader at Frazier International Magnet school who was chosen to participate in the Spark Program. I was just wondering if you could help me and my friends with our project. We were planning on creating a shirt with a message to stop the killings in Chicago. The shirt will say \"Shoot Hoops Not Guns!\" We know this might not work but we atleast want to give it a chance. But in order to do this we need money. Thats why we\\'re begging you for a donation. It doesn\\'t matter how much you give us but we would still be thankful. Also for the people who are shooting the guns - \"Please put the guns down!\" I lost my cousin to gun violence a few years ago and he was like a brother to me.Semaj R.Hi my name is Semaj at Frazier International Magnet School in Chicago who was also chosen to participate in the Spark Program. I am trying to raise money to make t-shirts that will build awareness for gun violence in Chicago against kids like us. I want people to donate money to us because I think that all kids should grow up and have a future to pursue. I am doing this because I lost a brother to gun violence as well.After being open for over 3 1/2 years,due of a series of unfortunate events, GrandmaJ\\'s will have to close before the end of the year without your support. Please help keep this very special place open bymaking a donation.We greatly appreciate your help and humbly ask that donations be made byDecember 31, 2015.THANK YOUFOR YOUR SUPPORT!Grandma J\\'s opened its doors in 2012 bringing a boutique brunch spot to the Humboldt Park neighborhood.Opening a cozy place with a laid-back, friendly and familycentered atmospherewas a long time ambition of owner, Layla Malia K. after working in the service industry for almost 20 years.After becoming a mom, Layla decided that it was time todo just that, so that she could spend as much time as possible with her daughter, Nova Bea. Grandma J\\'s was named after Layla\\'s mom, Jude, who along with Layla\\'sGrandmaBea, taughtLayla how to cook. Itwas always Layla\\'s intention to name herfirst place after her mom. Jude played a huge role in helping Layla realize her dreamof opening her own business. If you ever had the opportunity to sit in Jude\\'s kitchen over a home cooked meal or cup of Swedish coffee, it would be apparent where theideabehind Grandma J\\'swarm, friendly, made-from-scratch organic comfort food began.  In 2013, Layla lost her mom and best friend to cancer. GrandmaJ\\'s not only remains a tribute toJude but her artwork, grace, warmth and love arefoundin every corner and in every dish. Grandma J\\'s has always been committed to serving food that is organic and locally grown. It is important to Laylato give back to the community by promoting small businesses in and around the neighborhood and by always keeping the importance of family at the forefrontthrough story time brunch and art classes for kids.The restaurant has won awards and has been featured on Chicago\\'s Best, Red Eye, Thrillist , Chicago Magazine and many others. It has become a go to Brunch spot.  However, even with every table full and a line out in front most Saturdays and Sundays, after being open for over 3 1/2 years, the restaurantwill have to close by the end of the year withoutsupport.Through a series of unfortunate events, Layla is struggling to keep the doors of this very special place open.Layla loves what she does and you can taste the love in the food and feel it in the atmosphere. Before she has to make the very tough decision to close this business that she has put everything she has into, wewanted to provide an opportunity to help keep this rare refuge in the city, where you can always get a great home-cooked meal, and sit with friends and family over coffee open.Layla is SO grateful to all of her family and friends who have supported Grandma Js over the years. We know its a busy time of year for everyone, but if you could take time to support Layla and Grandma Js by stopping by for breakfast or lunch and by making a donation to show your support and keep Grandma Js open it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.*If you choose to pick one of the reward level donations make sure to letLayla and her staffknow when you visit the restaurant! You can pull up your donation receipt through your email in order to redeem your discount or free coffee. Thank you!As most of you know, Lyle and John\\'s home and car not to mention laptop and other assorted high end kitchen items that Lyle uses in the bakery were attacked and destroyed this week due to sheer hate and ignorance. Thankfully the beautiful dogs they rescused probably chased off the offender and thankfully they didn\\'t get to Lyle, who was asleep alone as John was away. They both feel very fortunate all they lost was material things. (We all are!)They have insurance with a very high deductible. I am starting this gofundme in an effort to offset some of their cost. I posted the story and link to the story below. These two men give back to the community, help others and are just people you want as neighbors and friends. So, if you want to pass up that bottle of wine, pack of smokes, miss a movie, skip that bagel please toss that money it into this fund to help our friends, because I know they would help any one of us without batting an eye. Thanks so much! LindaFrom WNYT:A three letter gay slur sticks out like a sore thumb on the front of a brick Cape Cod in Wynantskill. Lyle Houston woke up to the crudely spray painted wall Thursday morning, then he called his partner, John Mcenerney. \"You would think my initial gut reaction would be like, \\'oh my God, I fear for my life.\\' I kind of feel more sorry for the person that they felt it was necessary to try to destroy somebody\\'s house,\" said Mcenerney. Much of it is illegible, but \\'Jenner\\' is also written on the front of the house. An apparent reference to transgendered woman, Caitlyn Jenner. John doesn\\'t really understand how that would apply to him, since neither men are transgendered. Lyle\\'s Jeep window was broken and so was a window pane in a side door.  Lyle didn\\'t want to go on camera, but he was home at the time of the incident, and said he never heard anything. After seeing the hate speech, he put up shutters over the words to hide them.  \"It\\'s kind of ridiculous that in this day and age we have to see stuff like this happen, but it does, even in Wynantskill,\" said Mcenerney. Neighbors say they\\'re surprised this happened. Lyle and John have no idea who could have done it and why. They say they live a quiet life and don\\'t have any enemies.  \"If the person who did this, he, or she, or they develops a conscience and goes \\'hey, maybe I shouldn\\'t have done that,\\' but I\\'m not holding my breath,\" said Mcenerney.Lyle said there was also an incident Monday night, but his pitbull scared away someone he now thinks was trying to break in. The couple says they aren\\'t scared, they\\'re just going to remain positive.North Greenbush Police haven\\'t returned our calls. Lyle and John say that department is handling the case. http://wnyt.com/article/stories/S3860724.shtml?cat=300Hey guys, I\\'m Kyle Carlon, aka \"Switch.\" I\\'m a competitive Super Smash Brothers player from the NY/NJ region. I joined the scene in April 2014, and for as long as I\\'ve been entering tournaments, my van, which seats 12 people, has been a primary source of transportation for not only me, but my friends, acquaintances, and other players from the NY/NJ region as well. Without my van, many players, as well as myself, have no reliable way to get to out of state tournaments, or even our local.I have driven to MD/VA, Long Island, Pennsylvania, New England, and even as far as Michigan with players of all smash games for large and small tournaments.Unfortunately, my van had to have its transmission replaced, which means I can no longer bring myself or others to tournaments until I pay it off. With so many exciting tournaments on the horizon, I want to be able to make sure that not only I, but as many players as I can possibly fit in the van can attend as well. Any and all donations are very greatly appreciated. Even if you are unable to donate, simply spreading the word is very helpful. Thank you <3Below is just one exampleof a carpool of smashers before we headedhome aftera tournament.Our friend and fellow classmate Sam Wells is in great need of funds for the essentials of life. He needs these funds as soon as possible. Please let Sam know that he isnt alone.

The building restoration company would remove the necessary brick from around the archways in order to facilitate their disassembly. After the surrounding brick is removed, the stones will be carefully removed from the archways one at a time and have the residual mortar removed. The stone will then be marked and cataloged as they are palletized and wrapped for storage. We are under the gun, as the demolition for the old school is slated to start in mid-June and we need to collect $38,500 in pledges by June 7th. The All or Nothing Campaign is for pledges towards the $38,500. If we dont raise the money we wont be able to salvage the arches, so they would be destroyed and only the cornerstones would be saved. Fundraising for the erection of the archways will be in the near future.Online pledges will be accepted at gofundme.com and click on Save Wells History to make your pledge. If we reach our goal, your pledge would be charged to your credit card. If we dont make our goal, your credit card would not be charged. The Wells Historical Society along with the building restoration company believes in the preservation of these arches. The idea that current and future generations can walk through the arch that their parents and grandparents walked through; to run their hand on the stone that their ancestors may have touched, is a link to the past unlike many memorials built today.Help keep CEDEJO (Centro de Desarrollo Jocotepec, A.C. ), a non-profit women\\'s clinic that provides reproductive health & family planning services to indigenous and low-income women and girls in Jalisco, Mexico, open for another year. Individual donations are currently CEDEJOs primary source of funding.A minimum of 12,000 US Dollars (~165,000 Pesos) will keep the clinic running for one full year, from January through December 2015. Please read on to find out more about CEDEJOs programs and how you can make a difference.Who started this campaign?I\\'m Sheila from Vermont, USA.  I\\'ve been bicycling around the worldwith my partner since 2011, in large part, to create a life better aligned with my values (in other words, a life of simplicity and one that would allow me to focus my energy on local and global issues that are important to me). I don\\'t have much money to give to organizations whose missions I believe in but I am able to offer my time and skills to help them meet their goals. I am currently traveling through Mexico and I have been volunteering with CEDEJO since early 2013. (Me cycling through Baja, MX.)ABOUT CEDEJOCentro de Desarrollo Jocotepec (CEDEJO), A.C., located in Ajijic, Jalisco, Mexico, has provided care to indigenous and low-income women and families in the area for over 30 years. (CEDEJO\\'s headquarters in Ajijic)Twice a week CEDEJOtravels to Chapala, offering free pap smears, breast examinations, birth control and family planning counseling to the Tepehua community, one of the poorest barrios in Jalisco. (CEDEJO Director Sylvia Flores greeting women lined up to receive services at the Tepehua clinic.)Another two days of the week CEDEJO travels to vulnerable communities around Lake Chapala via their mobile health unit. By travelling directly to low-income communities, CEDEJO is better able to reach women and girls that otherwise would not seek out or be able to afford services. For the rest of the week, CEDEJO\\'s headquarters and clinic in Ajijic accepts clients by appointment. In addition to providing the above services, CEDEJO also leads educational programs and presentations through a variety of community organizations, schools and forums. In 2013-2014 CEDEJO successfully completed an all-volunteer-run pilot project (Mujeres, Poder y Vida  Women, Power and Life ) which provided over 60 sessions of comprehensive womens empowerment workshops to the women and girls of the Tepehua community. LOOKING BACK on 2013-2014In March 2013, in dedication of International Womens Day and after meeting with the Director of CEDEJO, I volunteered to increase CEDEJOs visibility online and update their informational material. As a part of that plan I needed to get updated graphics so I visited their clinic in Tepehua to take photographs of their work. (Director Sylvia Flores meeting with clients)(Director Flores & Volunteer in exam room of clinic.)During that visit I discovered that CEDEJOs future was in jeopardy. The little funding they were receiving from an international civic organization was going to end in only two months due to new changes in organizational funding rules. And although CEDEJO had received various forms of government and international financial support in its past, world-wide political and financial changes of the last decade had resulted in the disappearance of those valuable funding sources. Unless funding was secured, the clinic would be forced to close its doors in September 2013. After seeing the women and girls line up to receive services from the clinic and realizing how valuable CEDEJO was to the local community, I decided to attempt to raise the funds to keep it open for another year. In August 2013 I began a campaign on Go Fund Me with a goal of raising $12,000 USD (~165,000 pesos) in 12 months. Seventeen months later, through the generosity of world-wide donors, we had raised over $13,000 USD (~178,000 pesos) which allowed the clinic to remain open through December 2014.As we enter 2015, I am celebrating CEDEJO\\'s successes of the past year. In addition to raising funds to keep the clinic open for the last year, CEDEJO also realized the following progress:   Anew website, which includes a blog to keep people updated as well as on online donation function    Anew informational pamphlet for CEDEJOs educational programs which replaced their old one from 1986    New and updated photos of CEDEJOs clinics, workshops and programs (& setting up their FLICKR account).    Creation of a CEDEJO Facebook Page     Creation of a CEDEJO Twitter Account     Press coveragewhich helped spread the word about the clinics need for fundingAs a result of CEDEJOs extensive outreach, new connections were made in 2014. For example, CEDEJOs Director and volunteers met with representatives of the CRED Foundation of the UK while they were visiting Mexico in 2014. These meetings led to a partnership with the CRED Foundation which will begin in late 2015. This partnership will potentially facilitate CEDEJOs fundraising efforts.CEDEJO also met with visiting representatives from Horizons, a Canadian based non-profit organization committed to promoting social justice and people-centered development in Central America and Mexico. Horizons and CEDEJO are currently exploring possible partnership opportunities for 2015 and beyond.In addition, CEDEJO spent many months of 2014 meeting with numerous officials and applying for a variety of Mexican government grant programs. CEDEJO hopes these efforts will result in some fruitful outcomes in 2015.However, CEDEJOs CURRENT NEED is CRITICAL Although CEDEJO\\'s volunteers have been working hard to secure more funding from other sources, these efforts have not yet produced any new long-term funding opportunites. CEDEJO is currently being kept open through the generosity of individual donors, like you.WHY DO WE NEED TO KEEP CEDEJOCLINIC OPEN?Cervical and breast cancer are the leading causes of death among women from ages 35 to 60 in Chapala, Jalisco. CEDEJOis working to prevent these diseases, as well as other diseases, from affecting women through early detection and treatment programs.(Exam Rooms in clinic serving Tepehua Community)Because of poverty and/or lack of education and/or failure of government assistance programs, many women cannot afford to see a nurse or doctor for a routine gynecological exam or prenatal care. CEDEJO helps change this paradigm by educating women and girls about their options. CEDEJO also travels TO the communities that need services the most and has been working in the area for over 30 years, so the communities trust, respect and respond to them. (Women often can\\'t travel far and/or cannot leave their children to gain access to services. CEDEJO travels to their communities in order to provide them service.)Jalisco has the highest rates of violence against women in Mexico, with 60% of women having experienced violence by the hands of their partner. CEDEJO offers presentations, workshops and lectures through schools and other organizations in which the following topics are discussed: womens empowerment, domestic violence, gender equality, STDs, prenatal care and childbirth, family planning, risks of teen pregnancy, and hygiene and health.(\"Violence against women does not make you more of a man.\" CEDEJO\\'s workshops help empower women & men in order to stop the cycle of violence.)WHAT THE FUNDS WILL BE USED FORFunds raised will go toward covering the following: **pap kits for 1200-1400 women for one year **lab fees for processing pap tests for one year **transporting pap tests from Chapala/Ajijic to Guadalajara lab 2 times a month, every month, for one year **operating costs to keep clinics open at the very least 4 days a week, every week, for one year (i.e. phone, electric, internet) **transportation costs (via car pool or bus or mobile van) of unpaid nursing staff and/or volunteers to the CEDEJO free clinics, 4 times a week, every week, for one year **replacing or replenishing additional medical supplies needed to perform pap smears (i.e. patient examination gowns, sterilization equipment) **coverage of numerous workshops for youth and women\\'s groups in Ajijic and Chapala (family planning, STDs, women\\'s empowerment)Funds raised above the $12000 needed for the clinic costs for 2015 will go toward expanding CEDEJO\\'s workshops and educational programs and/or toward 2016 expenses.  HOW YOU CAN HELP I hope that others will see the value of CEDEJO\\'s clinicsand the services it offers and that you will find it in your heart to do one or more of the following:GIVE A DONATION.Donate via this campaign page or via CEDEJOs website .

I am a Type 1 Diabetic and I am a boy scout with troop 295 in West Deptford, New Jersey. I am currently working towards the highest rank of Eagle Scout and the next step is to complete my Eagle Scout Project. I am working with the Diabetes Center for Children at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. My project is to raise the necessary funds to purchase important supplies to be included in kits for newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetics. This will help them in their time of need. When I was first diagnosed I was scared. I am trying to give back to the community to help others in my same situation. There will be items in the kits that will help diabetics and their families adjust. Some examples of the important items to be included are alcohol pads, glucose tabs, and glucose liquid. I will also look to purchase a quantity of medic-alert tags to supply newly diagnosed kids.I am here as a leader to show other kids that being a diabetic is not a big deal. Children\\'s hospital has a need for hundreds of medic alert tags and supply kits for Type 1 diabetics every year. My goal is to make 150 kits that will be assembled by scouts from troop 295. Scouts and volunteers will help me distribute these kits at the hospital during the Living Well with Diabetes Conference on March 28th, 2015. I will be attending and participating at the conference and will lead volunteers inhelping with a Type 1 Diabetic \\'tween\\' program at the conference.I am asking for donations in order to purchase the supplies needed for these kits. You can donate easily online using this GoFundMe site set up for my Eagle Scout Project. All donations are greatly appreciated!I will post results of my project here and on a facebook page dedicated to my project.Thank youBen WeidnerTroop 295West Deptford, NJVisit the link below to learn more about the Living Well with Diabetes Conference http://www.chop.edu/events/living-well-diabetes-now-and-future'),\n",

       "  'Tyler is a very sweet, silly, loving 11 year old. At 2 years old Tyler was diagnosed with severe autism and is 100% nonverbal. During the school year Tyler enjoys school and works hard. But in the summer he struggles because there is very little that he can do. He is too severely affected to successfully fit into most summer activities. He has been on the waiting list to receive services for 6 years. Last year however, he was fortunate to receive a one-time respite funding through the state of Utah for individuals on the wait list to attend a specialized day camp during the summer. Volunteers at this camp have experience and training in helping children and teens with limitations similar to Tylers. It was the best summer of his life. For the first time, he had friends. He was able to participate in activities that hes never been successful at before. He was able to stay active. It was the happiest summer hes ever had. This year, due to lack of financing, he is facing another lonely and difficult summer. Returning to summer camp would be a great blessing and joy for him and provide meaningful social, emotional, and recreational activities.Here is a link to the program.  http://turncommunityservices.org/summer-adventures-in-salt-lake/Help Us Add 25 Hives in 25 Days - that\\'s 1,500,000 New Honeybees inOur Community!\\n\\nI hear it all the time. Friends and family members who hear about my beekeeping & raw honey business and wish they had \"the guts\" to try it themselvesbut are too afraid or don\\'t have the time to commit to it. Like me, they know that having a healthy honeybee population is vitalto our community and that local, raw, honey is in high demand. But it seems like a big step between \"wanting to do something\" and actually installing a beehive in your own backyard and being responsible for the colony of bees.\\n\\nTrust me, I get it. And it got me thinking.My goal for this summer is to expand the number of hives I manage significantly.My goal is to add another 25beehives to my business this year, but I can\\'t do that alone. Why? It costs money (roughly $270/hive) to buy all the equipment and honeybees I need to expand. And that expense has to be paid up front during months when honey sales are at their lowest.\\n\\nWe all know honeybees are incredibly important to our pollination and the health of our food supply. I have farmers begging me to put beehives on their property, but I don\\'t have enoughbees to help them out.So, what if we combined our needs and desires to make this happen? What could we do together?Here\\'s how I picture this working.\\n\\n1.You help sponsor a hive financially in part or in whole2. For every $270 raised I\\'ll buy all the equipment required to start a new hive and manage it on your behalf.3. You get to feel good about helping support a colony of bees (without the hassle of having to open the hive and poke around at them)4. I get to expand my operation, make farmers happy and increase our local,raw honey supply5.I\\'ll send you a picture of your beehive and put your name on the box as one of the sponsorsHow awesome is that? It\\'s a great way to be proactive about a problem you care about, without getting stung.\\n\\nSWEET REWARDS: If you live in the area, our family willhost a special GoFundMe celebration party and those of you who can attend will be able to come sample our tasty honey and take home a jar of your favorite for FREE.\\n\\nDonate $10 = 6oz of your favorite BeeKing\\'s honeyDonate $20 = 12 oz of your favorite BeeKing\\'s honeyDonate $50 = 36 oz of your favorite BeeKing\\'s honeyDonate $100 = A half gallon of honey from your hive (plus a special beeswax body care kit)Donate $270 = A full gallon of honey from your hive (plus a special beeswax body care kit)\\n\\nOh yeah, ifby chance we exceed our current goal we\\'ll update our campaign page to account for additional beekeeping tools/supplies that I\\'ve been looking forward to purchasing or hold the funds for next year\\'s expansion. Trust me, there is never a shortfall of financial needs in a small agricultural business like ours.Every little bit helps. There is no minimum pledge to participate in helping out. If you want to help butaren\\'t able to donateto this campaign, you can also consider supporting us by simply sharing a link to this site on your social media. Or maybe you just want tobuy a jar or two of our honey online this month.\\n\\nEither way, we really appreciate all of the love and support our family and friends have shown over the years. From our hive to yours, thank you & bee blessed.Hey all!From the very beginning the indie thriller Unsound has been a group effort. It wasn\\'t enough that I wanted to make a movie. It needed like-minded individuals to bring it to life. Actors that gave a darn and believed in their parts. (Limited) crew that believed in the script and what it could become. And of course, followers to help spread the word about this project. We seem to have succeeded on all fronts thus far. We were lucky enough to have a plethora of cast members that went above and beyond, a small crew that knew what they wanted and how to get it and tons of followers (Unsounders) on Facebook and You Tube that have helped spread the word.\\n\\nNow, the time has come to get this film out there for the masses to finally see. And it\\'s the last step of the way where we need all the help we can get. The goal here is very simple: raise some money so we can send this movie out to as many festivals that will have us. The only way to get known is to get seen. And the only way to get seen is to show the movie off.In theory, if everyone that clicked Like on Unsound\\'s Facebook page donated 1-2 dollars, we would have more than enough money to submit to a great amount of festivals and cover all the submittion costs and all that comes with it. Every penny will be used for this purpose. I know times are tough, money is tighter than ever -- and asking anybody for a handout takes a lot of nerve. But we should remember that the medium of film is only successful because of moviegoers and fans. And we\\'re all fans of movies!This has been a long, arduous journey full of sweat and tears and yes, a little bit of blood. I couldn\\'t have done it without all of you. So let\\'s see if we can pull out the stops one more time and bring this piece of work to the world.Andrew N. SarconeWriter, Director, Producer\"Unsound\"Please donate what you can so that I can bring my Mom from Australia to my retirement ceremony. I will be retiring from the U.S. Navy after 21 years of service and it would mean the world to me if my mother could be there. Unfortunatley, she lives in Australia and the cost of a round trip ticket is out of reach right now for both of us.In just 7 days I get on a plane and the Chiquil Youth Leadership Institute begins! I can\\'t believe it\\'s so close.From the start of this adventure, our team\\'s focus has been to empower the next generation through exposure to global experts and relevant training so that they become leaders who positively change their community, culture and country.But, as of today, we are looking at a deficit of $14,500and if we don\\'t solve for this, we will run out of resources on August 3rd. So it is safe to say, if Ive ever needed your support  its now.I think of the young man who inspired CYLI. Despite suffering sexual abuse as a 6-year-old boy, he is grasping for a way to establish purpose in his life through caring for others.

Great news to share!Every three years, Women Playwrights International hosts a conference in a new country. Playwrights from around the world submit scripts in hopes of being invited to be part of the event and have their work shared with a global audience. This year the conference is being held in South Africa, and they have chosen...my play Food for the Gods to be presented. Your pledges will help to guarantee that I will be in attendance at the conference to share this work and will make a difference for expanding the reach of my voice and writing to an international level. I\\'m very excited for such a tremendous opportunity, and I greatly appreciate your support and encouragement!The play chosen for presentation is \"Food for the Gods\" I wrote and directed this play as my thesis production at Sarah Lawrence College. It was a bold undertaking about HUMAN VALUE that confronted the difficult topic of Black Men and Police Violence in a very experimental way. Written not to incite anger, but to expose beauty, create relatability, and to cause CARE. It included a dinner table of puppets, audience participation, and a moving set. I am so grateful that the work was well received and turned out to be great success. Thus far, the play has beenawarded the Stanely and Evelyn Lipkin Prize for Playwriting. The topic has continued to be one of great concern that has now garnered international attention. For the past 2 years, I\\'ve worked to get the play remounted to a LOCAL NYC audience... but the efforts seemed to be without success; I have had a difficult time finding a space in New York willing to take a chance on remounting a work with such an experimental design .  Then comes this: An opportunity to share this workthese words to an INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE ...in a post apartheid country... wow. Yes. It is more than an honor. This funding will help me, my words, and puppets get there...and for me to share this story with eyes and ears from across the world. The project will be presented at the University of Cape Town, directed by a South African Director along side the words of amazing playwrights from Canada, Israel, Egypt, France, Zimbabwe, and more...directed by a South African Director. Thank you greatly for helping me reach my fundraising goal and to secure such a great opportunity.                    I. THANK.

Last year I had a lot of troubles to get the money to pay for the show and the sketchbook. I failed. I didn\\'t print the sketchbook because I couldn\\'t gathering the money on time. I struggled to pay for the booth too. Many things and projects got cancelled for lack of funds. Didn\\'t print banners and other materials for the show. I barely did SDCC\\'14. So please I need your help my friends and fans. I need to raise $2000 to pay the balance of my booth and $3000 to pay for the sketchbook. Those are my main concerns for this show. I would figure out how to get the rest for other materials. I do SDCC for you, the fans. Please help. I don\\'t want to fail this year. There\\'s many rewards levels so you will get somethig you would like for your invaluable help.\\n\\n\\nThanks.Our dear co-worker Roeuy is fighting multiple myeloma cancer. The goal of this fundraiser is to raise money to help pay thetuitionfor her three oldestchildrenso they can attend asummer day camp program. We are hoping to help ease the stress of finding activities to keep her school aged children busy during the summer so she candevote all her strength to fighting her illness. We want to give her children 13, 9 and 7 another focus to help take their mind off of what their Mom is going through, even if just for a short time. As parents we know these summer programs are very costly. The fee per child for a ten week program will run $1200.00. Also Roeuy gave birth to a beautiful baby girl two and a half months ago and her illness was discovered soon after she had the baby. Unfortanately, Roeuys medical treatments do not allow her to be with her newborn baby. Any additional funds collected above and beyond will go towards the childrens school clothing, diapers for the baby and school supplies. Your donations are greatly appreciated.  Please help supporther cause. Thank youJayla Amel Morrison was born on June 11, 2009. I had no idea these first five years would be as challenging as they have been. Jayla came into the world at just 4lbs 3oz. Beautiful but frail, she was immediately placed in the NICU, primarily because of a need for oxygen. While in the NICU, the doctors and nurses discovered several new areas of concern; Jayla was not eating well, and failed more than a couple newborn hearing screenings. Jayla remained in the NICU for seven long weeks. I just remember test after test with the doctors trying to figure out what was going on with our sweet girl.It was a local neurologist who saw Jayla during those NICU days that ordered an important test that would eventually help in figuring out this puzzle. Because her eating on her own never improved, her first of several surgeries was the placement of a feeding tube. Upon release from the NICU, Jayla was referred to Childrens Hospital in Denver, CO. At this point, she still had not received a diagnosis. At three months old, the results from the tests our neurologist ordered were instrumental in a diagnosis of Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorder (PBD). We really didnt receive much information during that first meeting at Childrens Hospital; the only thing I really remember was the doctor saying the majority of the babies diagnosed with this disorder only live a year or two and that there was no real treatment. Of course, we were devastated but have adjusted to this new normal. Today, Jayla has surpassed all that was expected of her. Jayla is legally deaf blind and has been going to Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind for the past 3 years where she has learned so much and CSDB gives us some support with her disabilities. Another support group we have been fortunate to find is the Global Foundation of Peroxisomal Disorders (GFPD), which is a resource for families that have a child with PBD. Our family has been able to communicate and meet other families with children with PBDthrough GFPD. This summer they are hosting a conference in Omaha, Nebraska for families and medical professionals passionate about PBD. Jayla will be able to be seen by some of these medical professionals in attendence, along with being able to be around other families and children with PBD. We just need financial help to get there and make this happen. I started this GoFundMe in hopes that our family, friends and new friends can share this and donate so we can pay for the conference fees, hotel, travel expenses and food while we are there. If you want to learn more about Jayla\\'s disorder you can visit  www.thegfpd.org.We appreciate everyone\\'s help!Hello, my name is Wendy George- Bush. I am the Proprietress of Girlz Time Childrens Spa & BoutiqueChildhood and adolescence can be trying times in a young girl\\'s life. Female youth living in urban communities, in particular, often struggle with self-esteem issues that can have a great impact on their ability to make healthy decisions. These stumbling blocks, however, are a natural part of the self-development process and not to be feared. With consistent guidance and support, young girls inevitably transform into a source of pride for their communities.Girlz Time Spa and Party Boutique, located in the heart of the East Flatbush Brooklyn neighborhood, aims to help guide young ladies during this often difficult transitional period. Because of this, we offer much more than your typical mani-pedi experience. While the spa is a fun-filled environment where young girls and teens can join friends for professional beauty treatments, the boutique\\'s core mission is to aid in identity development. With this value in mind, we offer a variety of self-development workshops within our space.WHAT TYPES OF SELF-DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS DOES GIRLZ TIME OFFER?Girlz Time facilitates a variety of workshops intended to aid in the self-development process. This include:A career workshop for older teens that intended to aid in the self-development interview practice.A body workshop for developing girls to better familiarize themselves with thier bodies.A debutante workshop and ball intended to officially present girls to society.A nutrition workshop where girls learn how to buy and eat healthy meals.A mentorship program where girls are partnered with \"sisters\" to help them with guidance.DOES THE SPA OFFER ACTUAL SPA SERVICES?Though identity development is at the core of the Girlz Time mission, that doesn\\'t mean there\\'s no room for fun! The Boutique is primarily used as a party space for girls to gather with friends, feel beautiful and let loose. Of course, there are beauty treatments! At Girlz Time spa celebration, guest can receive professional:ManicurePedicureFacailsAlso, while Girlz Time does offer traditional daytime spa themed parties, our space can be used for slumber parties as well. Whether hosting a party during the day or overnight, Girlz Time gives girls VIP treatment to make sure their experience is a memorable one.While getting pampered, girls will enjoy our assortment of snacks and non-alcoholic cocktails including \"Shirley Temples\" and our sparking apple cider. After receiving treatments, girls can walk down our built-in-runway to show off their new looks. Our boutique also features a video lounge, complete with movies, games and karaoke for even more fun.THIS ALL SOUNDS GREAT! HOW CAN I HELP SUPPORT!By making a donation, you are not only supporting Girlz Time, you are supporting your community. To make all of this happen, however, Girlz Time needs to raise an additional $25,000 in funding. Funds raised will specifically be used to:Purchase spa equipmentHire beauty techniciansHire wellness counselorsMarket and advertise Girlz Time servicesAs a token of our appreciation, contributors who donate $1000 or smallest contribution can make a big difference! So we thank you for any donation, large or small. If we reach our goal, the Girlz Time Spa and Party Boutique will open its doors in July 2015. HOW CAN I GET UPDATES ON GIRLZ TIME\\'S PROGRESS?

Would you, could you agree to sponsor a backpack for a needy WCS kid for only $20? This is the 3rd year I\\'ve celebrated my birthday in this way! My goal is 500! I don\\'t mind begging if I have too:)https://www.facebook.com/events/441873652656356/In 2004, I had a vision to create a space in which information about AfroPuerto Rican Bomba music and dance performance and practice could be shared, exchanged, and experienced in a way that elevated commUnity knowledge. Since that time, PROPA has organized 5 Bomba Research Conferences and engaged participants from all over the United States and throughout Puerto Rico. The conference was birthed in Chicago and called it home for the first three conferences (2005, 2007, and 2009) before it moved to Puerto Rico where it could draw on historical spaces and involve an older generation that was becoming less mobile and leaving this earth with the memories and experiences of a bygone era for the practice of this creole genre. PROPA is now preparing for its 3rd conference in Puerto Rico (2011, 2013, and 2015) and will add to the communities that have already hosted the conference; those include: Mayagez, Cabo Rojo, Guayama, Catao, Carolina, Piones, Puerta de Tierra, Santurce, and Arroyo. The conference has always been a grassroots effort, relying on in-kind donations for the great majority of the resources utilized. However, there are a number of costs involved with planning and implementing an international conference that is free of charge to any attendee who wants to participate AND steeped in research and tradition; this is where we need your support. Any amount is appreciated!Hello Everyone! We are helping to organize the first ever National Animal Rights Day event in Seattle Washington on Saturday May 30, from 12 noon to 4 pm, at Westlake Park.

Null, M.D. is an attending neonatologist for the Newborn Intensive Care Units (ICU) at Primary Children\\'s Medical Center, the University of Utah Medical Center and Intermountain Medical Center. He wasthe Medical Director for the Neonatal ICU at Primary Childrens Medical Center, and is now leaving after nearly 15 years, for bigger and greater things at UC Davis medical center . Dr. Null is and was a pioneering physician, as he broughtthe first ECMO heart and lung bypass program to Utah, and established the lifeflight teams at Primary Childrens hospital. Dr. Null has received numerous accolades during his tenure at the University of Utah, including the March of Dimes Neonatologist of the Year, and Cambridge Neonatologist of the year awards.He is beloved by many families of patients and staff that are affiliated with the University of Utah hospital, and Primary Children\\'s Hospital. He has been a tirelessly dedicated and devoted physician for many years as evidenced by his daily review of every NICU patient in the early hours of the day, and nightly calls to bedside nurses to follow the most critically ill patients at night. For many years, we have counted on Don\\'s expertise to help us navigate the most difficult patient management out there. This is a great loss for the staff and families of the state of Utah, but we also realize that Dr. Null has much greater work to continue elsewhere.We feel it is only fitting to send this amazing individual off with a lovely and gracious going away party. It is only a small token of our appreciation to this physician who has changed the landscape of newborn intensive care in Utah. Our heart aches for his loss, but we know that even when away, he will always be a valuable resource to us.The party will be an open house on Thursday, February 12, 2015 starting @ 5pm until it ends!

This year we will once again offer daily workshops sharing our own version of the traditional Balinese art of Kecak (aka monkey chant), 3 shows at center camp, as well as other processions and happenings all around the playa. Last year we lost our title of Marching Band Champions (to the super-deserving March Fourth Marching Band), but this year we\\'re determined to win it back. We\\'ve also got a few new surprises that we can\\'t wait to share with everyone at the festival. But this year we need some extra help bringing this gift to the festival.Maybe you have seen Gamelan X in the past at Burning Man or some other venue and you already know what it\\'s like to experience us live. Maybe you have some kind of connection to South East Asian art or culture and want to support the joys of live gamelan music to a larger audience. Maybe you have no idea what gamelan or Burning Man are, but simply like the idea of supporting live music that you think is cool.If you are any one of these kinds of people, we wold love to hear from you.The biggest cost that we have to overcome to get to the festival is for the transportation of the gamelan. We need to bring out our large gong cart in order to be able to make our processional ensemble mobile. This will mean renting a truck big enough to fit it as well as the gas to get it to the festival.  In the past this cost has come to $2000.The other transportation cost is for our musicians. We want to do some necessary repairs to fix up our tour bus so we can transport our performers with the minimal amount of gas and vehicles so we can keep our precious campsite as car free as possible. In addition to these transportation costs, we need to do some maintenance on the various stands, carts, harnesses, and cases that physically support the instruments. The big project here is to replace our old and breaking gong stands that we will need for our shows on the Center Camp stage. We have come up with a new system that utilizes easily acquired heavy duty speaker stands that are rated for at least 200 pounds each as well as aluminum cross beam truss systems. These stands will quickly connect via heavy duty drum hardware clamps and the whole system will be much stronger, lighter, and more portable than the old wooden designs that we have literally pushed past their breaking points.  And we can build this new light weight modular system for $500 with your help. While we are asking for help with the transportation and maintenance of the instruments and our performers, we are not seeking funds for our general camp infrastructure or for food. That\\'s all on us. ...so what\\'s in it for you? Well, if you are going to the festival, you can come and chant with us at:   1) HeeBeeGeeBee Healers Camp - Monday to Thursday @ 2pm   2) Center Camp - Friday @ 2pm...or see the band perform at Center Camp on:   1) Wednesday @ 10:30-11:30pm   2) Friday - Annual Marching Band Competition!!! 7:30-9:30pm   3) Saturday @ 1-2pm...or at TEDx on Thursday @ 4pm...or randomly around the playa....and if you are not going to the festival to experience the awesomeness, then we still have these excellent __ for you:$25 donation - Listed as a Supporter on our upcoming appreciation page on gamelanx.com$50 donation - Link to a pre-release of our upcoming EP this Fall.$100 donation - Gamelan X t shirt.

This condition affects the sweat glands, teeth and hair. They do not have sweat glands so they are always in danger of overheating and getting very sick. They require a lot of medical attention and at times it can get overwhelming. David and Mikey have always wanted to meet other people that have the same condition. They say they want to meet \"my people\" as David puts it. Every year the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasia has a family conference. They have different specialist that know how to treat kids with HED. This year it will be in Colorado Springs, Co. It is going to take place on July 23-25. We are raising funds to be able to attend this years conference. Any money that goes over our goal will be used to help with medical cost, and we would like to give a donation to the NFED.

Pat was a dear friend and colleague and her commitment to challenging herself physically, intellectually, and spiritually was an inspiration to all. She was an active and devout member of the Salem Baptist Church of Chicago who attended Prairie State College at night to earn her degree.  Sadly, she passed with only one class to complete to graduate.  Prairie, nonetheless, bestowed her with an honorary degree.  That\\'s why in 2012, Patricia\\'s family and co-workers at Clark Hill PLC provided the first donations to the Patricia Peggs Scholarship Fund for Adult Women ( www.ppsffaw.org).  It is the goal of the Peggs Fund to provide scholarships for women over 40 who are members of Salem to help them to earn their college degrees and to see their dreams come true. With Pat\\'s spirit in mind, running the marathon presents us with the opportunity to honor her courage, perseverance, and optimism and do our part to make sure that her name and memory remain bright light in support of the efforts of others to reach their potential.  We look forward to your support of the Peggs Fund and, hopefully, seeing you along the Marathon route.Ska Mom aka Shannon Browns Mom would like to attend the 2016 Salty Fog Cruise. The only problem is is that she doesn\\'t have the money to afford to buy a room/airfare, etc... So let\\'s help out ska mom and get her onto the cruise ship! If we do get her on the ship, she\\'ll be one of the best people that behave around the ship!Hands To Love is a non-profit organization for children with upper limb differences and their families. Hands To Love Hand Camp is a yearly gathering at Camp Crystal Lake in Starke, FL where families of children with limb differences can come together for peer support, networking and a lot of fun activities for the children. Our daughter Abigail was born with a difference known as symbrachydactyly which means short joined fingers,she has a full thumb and nubbins on her left hand. Prior to going to our first camp the only interaction our family could have with other parents of limb different children was by chatting online through various social media outlets. Abigailsonly interaction was looking at pictures of other kids with limb differences on the internet. We hoped sinceAbigail\\'s birth shewould have the opportunity to meet at least one other child with some type of upper limb difference so she would see that she was not alone.Our first camp was in 2013 and we were a little nervous at first, but we quickly felt like part of a giant family. Our daughter was able to associate with other kids just like her for the first time. Our oldest daughter Kaitlyn was able to see that her little sister was not alone and neither was she as the sibling of a child with a limb difference. Needless to say we were overwhelmed by the amount of activities the kids had and the amount of peer and professional support groups that were available to us.Hand Camp is not just somewhere we go every year, it is more of a yearlyfamily reunion we attend. Camp has changed our lives for the better and opened our eyes to something amazing . Our family has made so many new friends and we have a huge network of parents and children who are so encouraging and supportive.  Hands To Love is such a blessing to our family and countless others. We truly feel that we are part of something larger than life.This is why it is so importantfor us to be able to give back to this amazing organization. They put on thisincredible weekend for us, free of charge.So this year, we have decided as a family tofundraise to help Hands to Love continue to offer this camp that means so much to so many families. It is only thru donations like yours that this event is possible.We appreciate your support and please know that no donation is too small. We thank you for your support! The Mallon FamilyFor more information about Hands to Love you can visit their website:  http://www.handstolove.org/Emery is an amazing 3 year old (soon to be 4!) who was diagnosed with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (  http://www.cdlsusa.org/ ) at 6 months old. Every 2 years the CdLS Foundation hosts a national conference in a different part of the country. We had hoped to attend the 2012 conference in Chicago but were unable due to Emery\\'s unstable health at that time. The conference this year (June 26th-29th) will be hosted in Costa Mesa, California. Doctors from around the country who specialize in CdLS come together and attend the conference. The parents get to learn about the latest research and attend workshops. The CdLS children get a one on one consult with the specialists to set up an individualized care plan to bring back home to their doctors to help make sure they get the best care possible. The conference is an amazing opportunity to finally meet other families who go through the same struggles as us, learn from other\\'s experiences, and just be in the company of those who \"just get it\" ; to feel \"normal\" for a couple days. Emery\\'s sister Kyleigh will also be joining and get to see other siblings and how they interact with their special siblings. We are raising money simply because we would hate for Emery to miss out on such an awesome opportunity simply because of the lack of funds. Attending school full time doesn\\'t leave much room to plan out fundraisers, so this is kind of our one shot. The families are responsible for travel expenses, hotel costs, a rental car, food, and registration fees. We qualified for a first time attending scholarship so our registration fee was waived. But travel and hotel fees are not cheap. Anything helps. We are determined to get Emery to California one way or another (: thank you!As a child I remember going through my parents\\' wedding photos wondering why they had pledged thier wedding festivities to raise funds for charity, for AGBU. Next week I am turning 27 and for the second year in a row I am pledging my Birthday for urgent humanitarian need in Syria. Thank you mom and dad, now I understand why. I grew up in a peaceful community in Aleppo where organizations like the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) sustained a healthy community lifestyle made possible through a vast body of devoted donors and volunteers. Today Syria is in war and AGBU has once again turned to its initial mission statementof 1906 to providedesperately needed aid to those in need. Since the outbreak of Syria\\'s Civil War, AGBU\\'s Syria Relief Fund has been providing a lifeline to thousands of families through the support of global donorsand the help of over one hundred volunteers in Syria. Most of these volunteers are friends I grew up with, went to school with or served the community with as part of AGBU\\'s Scouts movement and student association. These brave men and women who stayed back in Syria have been putting their lives in danger every day to make sure aid reaches those who need it most. Dear family and friends, for my 27th birthday I ask you to give me the gift of contributing to the humanitarian work my friends are doing in Syria. Please help me raise $3000 in support of AGBU\\'s Syria Relief Fund.Please visit  http://agbu.org/syriarelief/ or contact me for further details.NOTE:Friends in Lebanon and other countries where Gofundme is not supported: I am kindly asking you to go straight to AGBUs Urgent Appeal page < https://donate.agbu.org/agbu-urgent-appeal> and add \"Anna\\'s 27th Birthday\" in the comments section. I promise that in less than 24 hours I will add your contribution to the Gofundme platform. Please mention \"anonymous\" in the comments section if you want you contribution to be anonymous.Please join us to help Jade talk!Jade, age 3, is a loving, compassionate, fun loving and very smiley little girl. She loves to play with her brothers, get hugs from her Mommy and Daddy, and explore the world around her. She also loves to interact with people....its one of her favorite things to do!  She also enjoys anything princesses, she\\'s a big fan of Hello Kitty and also is really excited about shopping!Jade has some health challenges. She has apraxia and dysarthria, as well as hypotonia, all which affect her ability to talk. Jade is completely non verbal except for her one, very important word, \"no!\" which she definitely uses ...just like any other 3 year old! :)We are raising money to get Jade an AAC device. AAC stands for Augmentive and Alternative Communications device. She got to borrow one this past week, and it was so exciting to get to see her communicate her needs, her wants, and also get to expand her ability to talk with friends and just about anyone she met!  A \"talker\" (as we are referring to it) helps Jade, who is completely \\ncognitively intact, communicate her thoughts, her wants, her needs, and \\nher feelings in a way that can be understood by those around her. She also has been able to describe what she wants to do, to eat, or where she wants to go. We tend to take the ability to express ourselves verbally for granted and not think much about it, but it has been such so very amazing to watch Jade be able to communicate some of these things for the very first time.The AAC device we would like to get is one that is downloaded onto an ipad. The ipad will be just for Jade to use to talk. Obviously there are other expenses too such as a protective cover, speaker, carrying case and a few other things (explained below)  that will need to be covered as well to make the device the most accessible and beneficial for Jade.I\\'ve included a detailed explanation as to the items needed to help Jade talk. Also included are some pictures, as well as, a video that gives you a glimpse of Jade using the borrowed device. We appreciate you taking the time to read this. We also thank you, in advance, for your part in helping Jade be able to talk!

It\\'s been 10 year since we\\'ve graced the halls of City College and now it\\'s time to come together and celebrate.As you know there is been much curiosity as to when our reunion will be! Well, we need your help to have a successful event. We must raise money for our deposit to hold our date for the location of our reception/party. Because So many of our class members have went away for school and other opportunities it makes traditional fundraising very difficult.

WITHOUT IT , THERE WILL BE NO REUNION!!Hi everyone.  A friend of mine contacted me and thought it would be nice to surprise Drew with a Bass Pro Shops shopping spree at the end of his current round of chemo.  He has pledged to match any amount up to $500.  This means we can potentially present him with a $1000 shopping spree at his favorite store!  Here\\'s the kicker... All we need from you is $1.  We just need 500 people to donate $1 each.  This little guy has been through so much and still has a long way to go.  I think he deserves a day to go nuts and not have to think about anything but what he loves, fishing.

Already they have a pilgrimage to the Holy Lands scheduled for the fall of 2015. They also dream of a pipe organ tour of Europe, the warm shores of Tahiti, and much more time onboard the family boat . In light of the Payntons\\' many accomplishments and years of service, we hope to make as many of these dreams come true as possible.In lieu of a gift, we ask you to consider making a monetary donation to the couple to thank them for their dedication to their students and community.

She earned double Bachelor degrees in Organ Performance and Music Education in 1976 and 1977. Her professional teaching career started in earnest in 1983 when she joined the staff at Our Lady of Guadalupe in West Seattle, where she developed the music curriculum and began choir and handbell groups. In 1993, Margie moved to the Highline School District where she remains until retirement, teaching at Salmon Creek and McMicken Heights schools initially, and Shorewood Elementary beginning in 1998. At Shorewood, she served on the building design committee and had significant input in the creation of the music space in the new school building. In a parallel career, Margie has served as the church organist, choir director, and subsequently Minister of Music at University Baptist Church since 1976. She became an ordained American Baptist Minister in 2010.About JimAfter the University of Washington\\'s Navy ROTC program discovered his colorblindness, Jim walked across campus and signed up to be a music major. Jim earned his double Bachelor degrees in Clarinet Performance and Music Education in 1976. He actually began his teaching career part time in the fall of 1975 at O\\'Dea High School, where he was only a few years older than his seniors. At O\\'Dea, Jim eventually taught a little bit of everything, including English, Religion, World History, Algebra, Health, Glee Club, and Band. In the fall of 1979, Jim joined the teaching staff at Kennedy Catholic High School, focusing exclusively on music and math. His successful orchestra program began in 2007, 32 years into his teaching career. Jim was honored as Music Teacher of the Year in 2008 by the Soundview Music Educators Association.

Sue\\'s daughter Katie filled in the members of her fun, monthly-meeting girls club, and they wantedto do what they could to support Sue. All 10 girls will be running in the September 27 Women Rock 5K/Half Marathon. We\\'re not asking you to run with us, but you can support our blisters and sore quads and aching knees by giving us some money! Really, there is no pressure. But every dollar willgo directly to Sue and her medical costs (not to acancer research society, though if you want to give there too, we\\'re in favor!)So, I was born.

Donors will be recognized on our program!Welcome Sponsors, On behalf of the entire TWU-Houston Fall 2014 graduating class, we would like to say thank you for contributing in our fundraising activities. We are raising monies for the Fall 2014 Pinning Ceremony which is a traditional and symbolic graduation from a nursing program. For the graduating students this will be one last chance for all of us to be together and celebrate reaching the end of our very arduous two year journey together. The customary pinning ceremonies for nursing students predate the nursing curriculum moving into colleges and universities the awarding of degrees. For many students we wish to maintain this tradition and take great pride in being welcomed into our new profession by our faculty and family in an intimate setting unique to the nursing profession.  For the Fall 2014 graduating class, the ceremonies are being completely self-funded and student organized. We are raising funds to provide a venue, decorations, programs for the event, and any refreshments served during the reception. Any assistance our sponsors can provide in raising monies to cover the costs associated with this event are very much appreciated.Thank you,TWU-Houston Nursing Class of Fall 2014For those wishing to make donations by check:Make the check out to \"Fall Pinning Ceremony\" and mail to TWU HoustonAttn: Student Life - Fall Pinning Ceremony6700 Fannin StHouston, TX 77030Hello All As you all know my oldest son, suffers from a neuro-muscle disease, This is his last year at MDA Camp.

Unfortunately, between the cost of the camp and transportation, we are unable to send him at this point. He has saved up a portion of it himself and we are in the process of applying for a partial scholarship that is offered but, of course, not guaranteed. I urge each of you to go read about this wonderful opportunity at campwoodward.com. I believe this is a great chance for him to take his passion and skill to the next level. Anything at all would mean the world and hopefully we will be able to get enough to make this dream a reality for him. All funds raised will go toward the cost of camp and transportation to and from Pennsylvania. IF by some chance we aren\\'t able to raise it all in time then the money will be put towards payment for a later camp session.Thanks to all of you for your timeAs a child I remember going through my parents\\' wedding photos wondering why they had asked family and friends to donate to charity instead of accepting gifts. Today I am turning 26 and I think I finally get it.I grew up in a peaceful community in Aleppo where organizations like the Armenian General Benevolent Union(AGBU) sustained a healthy community life through a vast body of devoted donors and volunteers. Today Syria is in war and AGBU has once again turned to its original charter of 1906providing desperately needed aid to those in need. Since the outbreak of Syria\\'s Civil War, AGBU\\'s Syria Relief Fund has provided a lifeline to thousands of families through the support of donors around the world and the help of over one hundred volunteers from within the country. Most of these volunteers are friends I grew up with, went to school with or served the community with as part of AGBU\\'s scout movement. These brave men and women who stayed back in Syria have been putting their lives in danger every day to make sure aid reaches those who need it most. Dear family and friends, for my 26th birthday I ask you to give me the gift of contributing to the humanitarian work my friends are doing on the ground. Please help me raise $2000 in support of AGBU\\'s Syria Relief Fund.Please visit http://agbu.org/syriarelief/or contact me for further detailsCaiden is my very tough 6 year old son he has downs syndrome he has had heart surgery, several ear and throat surgeries but he will not let that hold him back he also developed vitaligo which is why his skin recently became discolored we have walked in the annual downs syndrome buddy walk in his name since he was born we raise the stakes with donations every year and ask for people to join our team as well.So lets help Cai reach his goal this year any little bit helps.

Please add your new hire friends to this page, but lets make sure we keep it a secret from Sabrina.I am writing this on behalf of Audrey, I am her mom. Five years ago my girl went through some pretty hard times. Her dad moved out and to Missouri with about a week\\'s notice, leaving us with a house being foreclosed on and no income. I had been a stay at home mom up to that point. Audrey\\'s was 8. We lived well below the poverty line and survived because of good family and a 401k I cashed out. I found work and rebuilt our lives, but Audrey went through some very hard and painful times. She stopped growing, she fell behind in school, she spent more time alone and often said she was afraid and missed our old life. She missed her sister in California - someone she had seen fairly often when her dad would fly her to Washington. Audrey found bright spots... playing outside on her rope swing, building up strength by swimming, and naming the chickens we raised to have eggs to sell. Then she discovered Bethany Mota. From the first YouTube video she watched, she was hooked. Here was a teen girl, not much older than herself, who was finding relief from stress and bullying by posting YouTube videos. Bethany became a surrogate sister through those videos. Bethany gave Audrey hope that things get better if you stay positive and keep going. If you focus on the things you love, not the things bringing you down. Audrey has an opportunity to go away to a 7 day camp this summer, in Conneticut, (she\\'s never been to a sleepaway summer camp) where the camp leader is *Bethany Mota*. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet the virtual big sister that helped get her through all the hardest times - including only seeing her dad about 4 times in 5 years. I have rebuilt our lives, but the cost of tuition and airfare is beyond what I can afford on my own. So I\\'m asking for help to fulfill the biggest wish of my darling girl. She\\'s a strong, kind, resilient kid who has managed to catch up in school (got her first 100% on a math test two weeks ago!), learn to trust people again, and now is brave enough to fly across the country to meet her hero.Any money raised over the amount needed to go to camp will be used to send Audrey to California in June to see her sister whom she hasn\\'t seen in 3 years.Here\\'s to celebrating the life of a guy who always knew how to be the center of the party.Please join us in keepingJustin forever in our minds and our hearts.

She is the super creative, high energy, candy stealing, crazy person trying to sell you chocolate bars, coupon books or pizza bonus cardsin front of the shop. She is one heck of a sales person too. If you\\'ve met Ari you have heard her \"hard sell\".She pretty much vonlunteers for every school fund raiser she can and is always one of the top earners. She does this all on her own. She just sets up shop in front of Bluetile and starts stopping passers by with her aggressive sales tactics.Unfortunaly there are no school fund raisers that help send Ari to Skate Camp! If there were she would already be going. Ari has had the chance to skate with other kids her age on a few occasions and it always hypes her up and pushes her really hard. She skated in a contest with all girls not that long ago. Before the contest she couldnt even roll around the bowl but as soon as it was her run she rolled around that thing 7 times or more and took home 3rd place!Rachel and I have really been trying to figure out how to make it work but its just pretty far outside of our budget. I have been trying really hard to grow Bluetile and its working!.. but its also eating up a ton of resources. Couple that with Rachels doctor bills from her MS treatment and we are just spent. I would hate for Ari to miss out on something she wants so badly.So we set up this Go Fund Me to see if you guys could help! whatta ya say?Help us send this lil lady to skate camp!

For my senior year at the University of South Florida, I was accepted into the Anthropology Honors Program, which required a thesis component. My thesis research was conducted at Tampas Lowry Park Zoo, where I was an intern in the Primate Department. The abstract reads: \"Research was conducted to assess the publics awareness about orangutans and their endangerment and to educate them about the facts they may be lacking. Participant and systematic observations and short surveys were used to answer an integral question: do the connections made by the public with orangutans in a zoo setting lead to caring more about the species in the wild? The applied efforts of this project were to promote public awareness about orangutans as an endangered species, particularly due to palm oil production, and to inform the public so that they might become more environmentally-friendly consumers.\"After over a years worth of work and research and over 50 pages of writing later, I finished my thesis, titled Orangutan Conservation: A Call for Public Awareness, this May.I recently have been given an amazing opportunity to present a poster version of my thesis at the 2014 Orangutan SSP Husbandry Workshop & Conservation Summit on October 6th at the Houston Zoo! While I would love to participate in the conference, I cannot afford it given my current, unemployed, college graduate statusthis is where my family, friends, and friends of friends come in! Im in need of roughly $1800 to cover the flight to Houston, Texas, housing, food, local transportation, poster printing, and conference registration fees (and also the fees for this website). If you would like to see me take part in this awesome experience, please consider supporting me through this GoFundMe! I will only be able to go to the conference IF I raise all of the funds, AND you will only be charged IF and WHEN I reach the goal :) If you choose to donate, while I cant give you much, I will give you my eternal gratitude and Ill be sure to take lots of pictures!Now that Im graduated, with a degree in Anthropology, I am looking for a career in great ape conservation education and public awareness. This opportunity not only would allow me to present my thesis, but it would also let me hear some of the most influential people in orangutan conservation speak and potentially give me the chance to speak with them. If you would like to read my thesis, please let me know! If you would like more information about the Orangutan SSP Husbandry Workshop & Conservation Summit check out their website.The conference goes from October 6th-9th. (Also, please note that I was required to make levels starting at $5 and \"prizes\", I hope you enjoy them.)Makua Cultural Training CampJuly 11-18, 2014Makua Valley, Waianae, OahuGuest speakers, master carvers, practioners, educators & more Prepare your Hloa survival kit:Papa Kuiai, Pohaku Kuiai, Umeke, Apu, Oo & Ulumaika1.

RAHS primarily serves low-income youth of color who face real life struggles with homelessness, little to no parental support, substance abuse, gang involvement, and teen parenting. Many youth who were under-performing and under-served in the public school system are able to achieve long-term personal and academic success through Rosemary Anderson High School.Every year RAHS students demonstrate dedication and hard work as they overcome barriers to complete high school, pursue work and internship opportunities, go on to college, and realize their important role in the community. This school year, students and staff experienced an unexpected challenge, when three RAHS students were shot just outside our North campus. Although our community has come together to heal and gain perspective from this event, the violation of our safe space has left a lingering hurt with many.In its 30 years of providing academic second chances, RAHS has only enjoyed a few Prom nights. Without guaranteed state or federal funding, making what most consider high school rites of passage happen for our students is often not possible. This year, however, we feel that we mustfind a way to make it happen. Before parting for summer break, students need the opportunity to celebrate their achievements and experience a once-in-a-teenage-lifetime event and we hope you can help make this happen.We are starting from scratch as we prepare for the RAHS 2015 Prom; ensuring each interested student has access to prom tickets, attire, and transportation. Creating this much-anticipated Prom night will cost $100 per student, with an estimated attendance of 150 students. Any contribution you can make is much appreciated and integral in giving RAHS students a celebratory night to remember at the end of what has been a particularly difficult and challenging year for them. We thank you in advance for your contribution to this effort.What can I say? I\\'m a screenwriter. Paid? No. Good? Yes.

So, I\\'m asking you, my friends, my family, my social media besties... help me out. Give what you can. Help make this one, real opportunity for Hollywood screenwriting success a reality.

       "  'Hi! Im Jenny Present, a tenacious entrepreneur/small business owner and a proud single mom.Im raising money to further supportjenny present . You see, in the beginning I built this company while facing some major and unexpected life challenges. A little after my son was born my lifetook an unexpected turn. Everything as I knew it was flipped upside down. So when life gave me lemons.I made jewelry!Inspired by my son, the jenny present cornerstone collection was born - the Proud Mama collection.Each jenny presentnecklace in this collection is meant to signify a source and to symbolize the people and things you love most in life. Through all of the sleepless nights and bruised fingers (from hand stamping each piece!), I could only dream that these necklaces would be seen dangling around the necks of the most fashionable women around the world (including top celebrities).  See our press attention here.So this is where it gets interesting. Kris Jenner (powerful business woman and celebrity) is infringing on my brand through her trademark application for #proudmama.  But Proud Mama is what Ive built my business on! I am the owner of all right, title and interest in connection with PROUD MAMA, subject of United States Registered Trademark No. 3928036. The registration for the Mark was first issued March 8, 2011.I have spent significant time and expense in developing and promoting the Proud Mama jewelry collection while frequently using the hashtag ProudMama to promote the line. This collection has been featured in numerous magazine articles, endorsed on a number of television shows, and is popular with celebrity moms. Through these efforts, I have developed considerable goodwill in this trademark, and consider this Mark as one of my most valuable assets in my business. In order to maintain the integrity of this Mark, my company actively polices this Mark to prevent public confusion and to prevent dilution. I worry that the use of #PROUDMAMA by Kris Jenner will create a likelihood of confusion; that is, consumers are likely to be misled into believing that Kris Jenners #PROUDMAMA is in some manner authorized, licensed, or otherwise associated with my company or the PROUD MAMA jewelry collection. This constitutes infringement and dilution of my valuable trademark rights. Of course, I dont object to Ms. Jenners use of #proudmama if it is not intended for use in connection with her goods or services  but it appears to be. In fact, it looks like she might have recently started a jewelry collection and, if so, her use of my trademark blurs the line.Being an entrepreneur and a small business owner isnt easy. But nothing can prepare you for what may or may not be thrown at you while chasing your dream. And I need help. I cant do this on my own (even though I may try or want to at times).I will use the money raised to support any and all business ventures I deem appropriate to keep the jenny present brand growing and thriving. My jewelry is meant to inspire and empower the women that wear it. I am fiercely determined to show women (especially single mothers) that no obstacle is too large to overcome. We all fight battles on a daily basis, some bigger than others. I will fight to keep my business going, growing and thriving. Please help me achieve my dreams! Thank you!!Warmly,jpRead some of the press attention here:Glamour.comPerezhilton.com Perezhilton.com tmz.com tmz.comFor those of you who don\\'t know me, my name is Jamie Barlow and I have a passion for teaching martial arts to students of all ages. Being a martial arts instructor is an incredible experience. In my teaching career, I have many memories of shy, bullied, excitable, and focused students all achieving success through martial arts training. I first began my taekwondo training in 1997 at the age of 15. My affinity to teach quickly became apparent and I started assisting with instructing. This gave me the opportunity to develop leadership skills and realize I want to spend the rest of my life touching lives through martial arts.I have been given an invitation to take over an existing martial arts studio in Sandy Utah however, in order for me to make this work, I need some financial support. I have already begun working with a mentor. He\\'s successful in his multiple school ownership and will assist me in building this existing business into a thriving martial arts studio.The build-out on the space isn\\'t quite complete and it is also lacking a sign that is visible from the street. The money raised here will go to paying first and last months\\' rent on the facility, a banner as a temporary sign, utilities for the first month, obtaining a business license, finishing some of the remodel, and any unexpected expenses in the beginning.Every donation and every share on social media will assist me in being able to realize my dream! You can give any amount and the reward levels break down just how attainable this amount can be.

Answer: THE FISH WAGONThe Fish Wagon can use your help!!!A major unexpected expense has bobbed up for this small family business. (1999-2010): The Fish Wagon is a family-owned and operated food business located in Farmer City, Illinois. It started back in 1999, when Kevin Castle came up with the idea to start a summer venture with his 15-year-old son, Seth. Kevin knew that The Fish Wagon would be the perfect project for the two to spend some real quality time together before his son quickly slipped away into the crazy life of a teenager.  That year, in the early winter months, father and son worked everyday side-by-side gutting and renovating a 1970 Winnebago with one common goal in mind: to have fun together. Their plan was to construct a food-truck capable of selling fried fish sandwiches and to have it up and running by the summertime. Any available free time after work or school was consumed with making this dream a reality. To their surprise, all of that hard work finally paid off, and before they knew it, they were in business. (Photo: The original Fish Wagon) The Fish Wagon was an instant hit with the locals. Together that summer, Kevin and Seth spent every weekend filling hungry bellies with the best fried fish around. Little did they know, this was not just a one-time summer venture, because this small business created a new life for itself.  People from all over started coming to see what all the excitement was about in this small town. As more people came and grew to love the Fish Wagon, they just didn\\'t want to see it go. So, the Castle family pulled together, worked hard, and found the time each summer to keep \"The Wagon\" coming back for the customers. Several years into business, once Seth headed off to college, Kevins wife and teenage daughter stepped in to help him and keep this project alive.  It was originally designed to last only that summer of 99, but the Fish Wagon continued its success for over 10 years. Like they say, All good things must come to an end. A decade quickly flew by; Seth was now graduating college and Kevin still worked a full-time job. The decision to finally close wasnt an easy one, but the forty year-old Winnebago had seen better days. (2014-2015):Almost five years after closing the original Fish Wagon , the outpour of love from patrons continued as they begged for its return. After many months of discussion and debate, Kevin and his daughter, Michelle Castle, made the ultimate decision to re-open the Fish Wagon as a retirement project while giving Michelle the opportunity to pursue a career she already knew and loved.  Their goal was to make the Fish Wagon bigger and better than before. They wanted create a structure that was more permanent, so that this new venture had an opportunity to sustain a real future. The plan was to ditch the mobile food truck and to create an entirely new model such as a carry-out/indoor-seating version of the previous Fish Wagon.  Kevin immediately started looking into potential locations and buildings. He inquired about a Freedom Oil gas station in Farmer City that was run-down and remained vacant for over 20 years. Coincidentally, this building was conveniently located right across the street from where the old Fish Wagon was parked for business all those years before. In December 2014, Kevin purchased this location and a complete renovation was immediately underway. After months of hard work, the Fish Wagon passed all required inspections and was finally ready to be opened by May 2015. Again, it was an instant hit.(Photo: Inside the NEW Fish Wagon)(Photo: Outside New Fish Wagon)(Present): Today, this family business employs six workers total. Currently, the Fish Wagon brings sufficient revenue to cover day-to-day operations and expenses, but recently an unexpected expense has caused a set-back for this start-up business.Because the occupancy of the establishment has been changed from a service station to a restaurant, the state of Illinois requires both male and female handicap-accessible facilities to be available for public use. Currently, asingleunisex restroom is in place, but now is \"illegal\" and no longersufficient according to these state standards.(Photo: Current unisex restroom)Consequently, this bathroom remodel must be completed inorder for this business to remain in compliance with Illinois law and to keep the doors open. Now, avery costly remodel for two new restrooms is underway...(Photo: Construction for new bathrooms has started)Kevin has invested over $85,000 of his own personal funds intothe start-up of the new Fish Wagon. The costs for building these brand new bathrooms have been estimated to a hindering $30,000 (nearly half the cost of the initial start-up investment).Please help save the Fish Wagon and keep this thriving business alive.

On a trip to the slopes with friends, no cash for a board rental he resorted to an off beat snow covered hillside with his skimboard. Realizing he couldn\\'t maintain control without the use of bindings he reached out to dear \\'ol Dad (Mike Kulow) to figure out a way to cinch his feet to the skimboard. After a quick trip to the hardware store and a feverish conversation of possibilities with this idea... KOOL BORDZ was born! Since that 14th day in February 2013 we have filed our provisional patent for intellectual protection and produced several working prototypes.We are raising money to help support our first production run of boards and clothing. This venture has been a blast so far for a young and aspiring 19 year old who has the dream of making a fun and affordable product that can be used year round.We are not trying to perfect years of technology produced by snowboard, sandboard, skimboard or wakeboard manufacturers.KOOL BORDZ is a well rounded board that allows riders of all ages, skill levels, and athletic abilities to have fun riding on multiple surfaces seasonally without the expense of having to purchase a separate board or apparatus. KOOL BORDZ offer a different ride when comparing it to other board types allowing riders to be creative in this evolution of board riding.  We are an upstart and fast growing company. This is a whirlwind affair and we want to encourage all ages to be a part of this cultural change in extreme and recreational sports. Our online store is under construction so please be patient as we make changes. We are focused on providing  excellent customer service with the highest levels of customer satisfaction. We will do everything we can to meet your expectations.With a future variety of merchandise to choose from, we\\'re sure you\\'ll be happy working with us. Look around our website and if you have any comments or questions, please feel free to contact us. Thanks for visiting & we hope to see you on a KOOL BORDZ soon! VISIT: www.koolbordz.com \"ONE BOARD WITH RIDE VARIETY\"TESTIMONIAL:\"I had the opportunity to be one of the first demo riders of a KOOL BORDZ and had a blast! Because of the different design it was a new and fun experience. I think it\\'s awesome that this board is for multiple board sports\" TAWNI WILLIS\\nAASI CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR- SNOW SUMMIT CAHello Friends and Family,I\\'m getting ready to launch my business--Pure Heart Chocolate--next month in Santa Cruz, and I could really use your help! Next month, my truffles hit the bakery shelves and farm stands of Santa Cruz county (and beyond), and I\\'m in need of some revenue to make it happen. A preliminary list of things I\\'ll need to make this dream a reality includes: *rent on a commercial kitchen*insurance and licensing*a commercial-grade fridge*a commercial-grade freezer*a large chocolate-tempering machine (the one I currently have only allows me to work with 1/2 a pound at a time/about 100 truffles)*a Vitamix to blend up the smoothest ganaches known to humans*a vibrating machine which will allow me to settle the truffle fillings in their molds and create zero mishapen misfits (they still taste good, but the beauty of a perfectly molded truffle is something to behold!)*sustainable and beautiful packaging*marketing and accounting help in the office*and of course, some extra hands in the kitchen to make the magic happen As many of you know, I\\'ve been making raw vegan chocoate truffles for the past 5 or so years, perfecting my craft over time, using the kitchen as my creative outlet to make chocolate that is not only more delicious than the mega-produced, waxy, cloyingly sweet variety I could find on store shelves, but more sustainable, too. By leaving out the dairy, the processed sugars, and the hard-to-pronounce preservatives, I found that what I was left with was cacao in its purest form-- raw, unadulterated, and incredibly delicious. This cacao, in its purest, most sacred form, is what I offer with Pure Heart Chocolate. I look forward to your feedback (pun intended, heh) and to sharing my love of chocolate with YOU. Thank you in advance for your presence and for your continued support! -- Becky PotterPure Heart ChocolateThe Underdog Crew isa new Hip Hop toy and game that promotes the positive values of Hip Hop culture! What\\'s more? The toys are the ultimate symbols of positive forward thinking. Whether or not you relate to Hip Hop, theUnderdog Crew seek to find what common goals and values we share. The mission is led by many guiding questions, but the most important of all is, \"How many ways can we do good in this world?\"I expect that answering that question will lead to manyunexpected, inspirational, and unifying results. I have radical ideas about the business I am developing, and I am driven by a social mission. I challenge you to get inspired, share your thoughts, and ask questions. Your feedback and participation are as important as any monetary donation. Please watch the video to learn more about the toys.\\n\\nI amoffering a limited number of 250handmade sets (one spinner and two \"freeze dice\"). Each set will be numbered, will come with instructions, and will come with a hand written thank you note.The purpose of this offering is to raise enough capital to cover various expenses. The primary focus is to create prototypes that will lead to the next stage of3D printed toys! I am contracting WCU\\'s Rapid Center for the first three prototypes, and this campaign will help pay for their services. There are currently a total of 10 different figurines that make the complete set.Though I will soon have my first three prototypes, making the figures by hand is an important part of the process. Each handmade figurine is unique, but what really makes them special is the amount of positive intention that goes into every toy. While making these figures, I become inspired to no end thinking of all the possibility.  Will these toys inspire you? I certainly hope so!For your $30donation, I will make a set of 3 for a child of my choosing. I work with many children who have special needs, are disadvantaged, and/orshow strongintrerest in Hip Hop. Your gift will be a powerfull message of encouragement.For $50, I will make a set for you! You may inquire if you prefer certain colors. Please provide your address when you place an order. These toys are the best that I have ever made! Your first set will include a spinner, a baby freeze, and a chair freeze. If you purchase multiple sets, then youwill get different freeze dice (such as a turtle, hollowback, shoulder freeze, etc...). Two weeks is the standard turn around, but it could take as long as sixweeks if I experience high volume at any given time.Donations in any amount are welcomed. Customization is available and negotiable. Again, I makeevery figurewith great care and positive intention. I consider these figures to be tokens, or symbols, of all things good and possible. Everything that you believe to be good, and everything that you believe to be possible - so do they! Go Viral! Share this with your friends, talk it up, and stay tuned to learn more!

I\\'ve been a reguarly featured Chef on the WEYI morning show (Thanks WEYI) and provide my services to clients throughout the state of Michigan. Creating food has always been my passion and dedication. Wenow havethe opportunity to introduce some new levelsto Food2611. That dream is just within ourreach! We have already secured the building, liquor license, food license and start up capital which is a $119,000 investment but we need a little more help to revamp the interior and purchase some additional kitchen equipment. Whether we raise $50.00 or are blessed enough to reach our goal, we will be opening February 3, 2015. Any funds beyond our goal will be used in the foundation of our non profit organization, Chefs with Wings.Ourrestaurant will not only be a place where patrons can dine on a menu based on Michigan themed food and drinks, but will also serve as a base for our food delivery service and catering. All of our meals will be hand crafted from scratch, from fresh pasta to grinding our own meat. We will also use local produce to keep revenue in the community and our menu will be seasonal, changing as the seasons change. Our beverages will be focused on Michigan beer and wines and we\\'re hoping to work with a local distillery to stock our shelves. But, what we aremost excited about is the non-profit aspect that is planned! In the past year I had the honor of working with youth in the State of Michigan\\'s Foster Care program. I am working with this organization to continue mentoring these kids in the kitchen where they can learn a valuable skill and gain experience and ethics in the workforce. The focus of these teens will be the non-profit organization I\\'m putting together called Chefs with Wings. They will learn to make meals to be provided to families who have a child suffering from a terminal illness. Not only will these kids get work experience, but they will get a sense of gratitude knowing that they are providing relief to families who are going through a difficult time. With your help we will be able to update the building to make it more suitable for our mission. The funding will help to purchase 2 sous vide machines and additional burners to accomodate extra staff in the kitchen. It will also go towards fresh paint to brighten up the interior, building a private wine room and updating the bathrooms with new tile. This building was a former bar and our goal is to transform it into an American Bistro styled restaurant. In the upcoming days, we will post a video touring the building and talking more about our plans for the future.I sincerely thank you for your consideration and I understand that not everybody is in a position to donate, but would greatly appreciate if you could share my story with your friends and family!Thank you, again!Sincerely,Chef BradFood2611The Fore River Sound Stage has been in business since June 1, 2011. We are located at the old South Portland armory building, 682 Broadway, South Portland, ME. In nearly two years we have shot countless commercials, music videos, and photo shoots. We have had two feature films shot at our location: the independent film \"Backgammon\" in June of 2012, and the short feature film \"Watcher\" in March of 2013.We have 10,000 square feet of shooting space,as well as room for office rental space and an in-house still photography studio. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe owners of the Fore River Soundstage are : Eric Matheson, Mark Rockwood, and Matt Berry. Eric hasworked on over 80 Hollywood productions in his 40  yearsin the industry (only a select few are displayed on his IMDB page). Mark is a professional photographer,while Matt is finishing his last semester at the University of Southern Maine majoring in Business Administration.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have been fortunate in the funding we have received, but the renovation of the studio is still ongoing. The major issue at our location isthe current state of the roof. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe roof leaks, which has caused us to move our production equipment out fromourstorage space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have money set aside for further renovations, but we would ratheruse that money onthe renovations of offices, prop rooms, and the main stage. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cost of the repairs to the roof has been estimated at $18,000. We are seeking $10,000 to help in our movement in repairing the roof, any donation towards this cause is greatly appreciated.Affectionately known as Mama Nia and The Lunch Lady, for over 20 years, I have fed the community through home gatherings, schools, festivals, Farmers Markets, non profit organizations, healthy cooking classes, catering, and personal chef service. Understanding that you are what you eat I have always endeavored to serve delicious and nutritious foodsthe undercurrent of HuNias Kitchen. Inspired by my late grandmother Bernice Holley aka \"Big Mama\", as a child I was convinced that she was and still is the\"greatest cook of all time!\" Yet she (along with others in my family and community) suffered from high blood pressure, diabetes, glaucoma and strokes. As a result, I was determined to change that trajectory for myself, my family and community!  Therefore,thefocus of HuNia\\'s (Divine Soul) Kitchen has been primarily vegetarian, organic and locally sourced foods, because I am passionate in my belief that we can prevent chronic diseases such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes through healthy food choices. \\n\\n I love cooking! I am passionate about serving healthy foods to our community, So, with HuNias Kitchen  something good is always cookin  and now is no different! I am mixing up my love of cooking, my love of eating, and my love of travel to expand my purpose in the world. First stop Sweden, then Bordeaux, then Senegal. I want to experience international culture and food firsthand in the kitchens of home cooks and chefs from different parts of the world and then bring those firsthand experiences back to the Bay! I am forever grateful to serve using my gifts and talents doing what I love! Now, I ask for your gifts of love and appreciation through donations to my CookEatLove Tour. I just bought my ticket to travel for 22days (Nov. 17- December 8) and I need your support to raise $5000 for housing, travel, and additional classes. And yes--You\\'ll be with me in my travels through weekly updates via Facebook, video and Twitter. Please take this leap of faith with me; you can count on me to have a plate for you when I get back! .Thank you for supporting HuNias KitchenSomething good is ALWAYS Cookin!For the last two years our family has prayed about both DOING MORE and GIVING MORE to orphan care ministries.We had a pretty clear idea of what we were feeling called to do, but no clear answers on how to get from here to there... until now.So now comes the time that we step-out once again in faith, do something outside of the box and pray others catch the vision!The vision is simple - create a \"giving machine\".Establish a business for the purpose of raising awareness about orphan care, orphan prevention, foster and adoption that enables us to give much more to these efforts than we would have otherwise been able to on our own.We are going to be selling freshly brewed fair trade coffee and tea to make a tangible difference in the lives of these precious kids AND we are going mobile!That means we can come to you: churches, events, businesses, farmers markets, food truck parks, etc.With a mobile coffee bar the overhead will be far lower than with a traditional coffee establishment, plus we have the flexibility to travel to a wide array of venues.We will service The Woodlands, TX as well as Spring, and surrounding areas. If you live nearby (or even if you don\\'t, but appreciate what we are doing) we encourage you to support our start-up costs by contributing here.Our estimated start-up costs are between $16,000 - 17,000.We have a loan for the Shasta RV, but if we raise enough funds to cover these initial expenses, we can give more away sooner!Sustainable, continuous giving is the ultimate goal.We\\'d also love to help families with their adoption expenses via our sales and eventually employ kids who have aged out of the foster system and need to develop job skills and employment history.Thank you for taking the time to read about our journey.If you feel inspired, we invite you to come along for the ride!James 1:27Much love,The Scogin FamilyBen, Dea, Audrey, Eli & CroixLacie Mattox-Brewer is a single mother of four beautiful children.

TWO cancers! We still have the old slow moving one that\\'s easy enough to swat at when it gets big enough. Now let\\'s add to that one that is red, and mean, and (if a cancer had intentions) intends on kiling me. That ain\\'t gonna happen.So having raised enough funding to get the downpayment on my car (keep reading for that part) I\\'m now devoting this campaign to helping with the excruciating expenses of multiple hospital stays, and other fun stuff not covered by insurance. There\\'s a lot of them.I\\'m not giving up and I\\'m not giving in.Each chemo treatmentrequires a 5 day stay in the hospital (I was in-patient for over 20 days in December 2016) and the daily medications run around $500 + per month, including the stuff that insurance doesn\\'t cover at all. It\\'s a lot.So there\\'s still plenty to do! I\\'m still driving (well, as much as I can right now - i\\'m temporarily off the road until all this chemo clears out of my body.) I\\'m still moving forward with every intention of getting on with and moving along with life. Let\\'s just get past this one little setback and then back to our show....It\\'s time to bust out and take the next step in life!I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma AND end-stage liver disease in the spring of 2005. Over the years, I\\'ve been through 6 rounds of chemo, more side effects from cancer drugs than you can imagine. Now, 11 years later, settling into \"life with cancer\"withone of those medical conditions that can go into remission but will never completely go away.I\\'ve also been selling stuff - art, antiques, estate items, etc - online since 2001, and have had a great time with that. I\\'ve met tons of new people, had fun at lots of auctions and estate sales, and generally had the time of my life! So much so, that it\\'s time to get out of this house, and take this whole business thing to the next level:This spring, I started a test of my first \"brick and moartar\" store - in an antiques mall, 130 miles away - and so far it\\'s a great success. So much that I\\'m thinking of adding one more, as much as post-chemo energy will let me do. I save up my energy to spendon things I love like hanging with my auction friends, and researching my \"what IS this?\" shelf.Along the way I found a deep love for the art of North Carolina pottery. I grew up right in the middle of the Catawba Valley tradition of NC folk pottery and didn\\'t even know it. My house is now full of the stuff, and I genuinely love finding it so I can re-home it to collectors and decorators.Since the store is so far away (I go there 1-2 times/month) I need a *hauler* kind of car for the trip. I usually carry 5-6 tubs of carefully bundled new merchandise with me, spend a week there schmoozing with my antiquer friends and stay with my mom who lives in that area.I also need a car for things like trips to the post office to drop off packages, supply runs, and the ever important auction and sale trips to find the best merchandise I can for my store(s). It\\'s a lot of driving around in short trips, and I love to drive.To keep doing this AND to look for a second such shop, I need to upgrade my car to something like the old station wagon. This iswhere you can help. Every $1.00 donated helps and is totally appreciated.Here\\'s my plan:I set this goal in the $16,000 - $18,000 range as that is my entire budget for getting a car. I hope to get enough here to at least make the down payment. If it\\'s necessary I willfinance the rest. A decade-plus of medical debt does awful things to one\\'s credit scores, so it willdefinitely be by a sub-prime auto loan, and they have extremely high interest rates. Hopefully this campaign can help avoid that as much as possible.***What does 18 grand get you these days in a \"hauler\" type car?***This is for a vehicle (a car - no trucks or delivery vans) that\\'s 100% business. NO personal use.I\\'m looking for something station wagon-like for packing in the tubs of merchandise plus me, plus Dynah Thurst, the long hair Pom/Daschund mix who goes with me on the long trips. She loves to travel, and she loves to travel in her little crate so she\\'s always safe!The old hauler - unfortunately killed by a drunk driver. Don\\'t worry - we got out ok but our beloved MINI didn\\'t survive. And no, that is NOT Miz Dynah\\'s basket on top.Because of that long drive from home to the store, I need it to be a comfortable long trip car because I tire out easily.The more comfortable the car, the fewer rest stops. It\\'s about a 3 hour drive each way, with traffic.Great gas mileage is a must because every fill-up comes out of the bottom line of the business. Thegoal of all this selling stuffisto turn a profit to help pay some of these horrible medical bills that pile up every year like cord wood.I want to stay active as much as I can, for as long as I can, to help my family and caregivers support this long and drawn out disease process. And try to help others along the way, if I can.If I were buying today, the final total would purchase a 2013-ish Toyota Prius with low milesfor its age . We have had Prius in our family for years so I know them in and out and it\\'s a very nice car, all jokes aside about hybrids.Plus, to get out of the house more (Doctors\\' orders!) I want tobe able to offer rides with the car to folks in my area who need a lift to their doctor\\'s appointments and need a vehicle that can hold a wheelchairif necessary. My own past wheelchair experience when I was very sick taught me that the Prius fits the bill, as do a few other smaller/roomy high MPG cars.If it can carry tubs of merchandise, it can carry a wheelchair, so why not put that space in a high MPG car to use for the better good?The reason for that is that when I was very bad off with cancer and could not walk at all, some very nice people in my church parish and in the community helped get me to appointments and support group meetings. I\\'m well enough now - for the time being - that it\\'s time for me to return the favor.And when I\\'m gone, as in ... dirt nap... it\\'s in my will that the car *(assuming it\\'s all paid for!) should either be donated to a cause that helps patients get rides to their appointments, or that someone in my family will use the car for this noble purpose. If they don\\'t: I promise you I will haunt them!If you\\'d like to read more about my whole cancer journey, I keep a health journal on Caring Bridge, just click on this link: John Myers: The Dance .It\\'s time now to step up and get busy with this store. My next step is to add on a new retail selling blog with my store merchandise, plus plenty of how-to information about antiquing and collecting. The site is being built in our super-secret laboratories right now and should launch \"any day now,\" with its own Facebook page (watch this page for more info!)It\\'s a lot to keep up with. I miss that kind of schedule from my old retail/marketing/email diva days.I have a bit more energy to build as much of that as I have time. And then me and the dogs take a nap.I hate sitting around the house. I loathe watching any sort of daytime TV. Oh, and I\\'m self-teaching myself bluegrass music on the viola (don\\'t ask) but that\\'s a whole other story.For each and every donation, and even for your positive comments and good wishes, Dynah and Iboth offer our unending thanks, and wish you all the best as we put this plan on the road!Thank you so much for your help, thoughts, and prayers.John and Dyna Thyrrst.Hi Folks, I am Greg Frankhouser, also know as Master A, in the SCA. I make and sell Medieval Pottery for the re-enactment market. My mugs have some reknown as \"Almost Indestructable.\". You\\'ve seen me at Pennsic, Gulf Wars, Battlemoor, Estrella, and Great Western.Here\\'s the deal. Came home from the Fair (as I had 3 weeks prior) and unloaded the dirty clothes, but left the rest of the gear in the van (as I had 3 weeks prior). And it was stolen, even with a load of lumber on the roof. The van was locked and in a previously secure location. The van was found , 3 weeks later, Empty even of the trash.So, the damage, All of my \"Court\" Costumes, all of my Inventory, Displays, Tables, Booth, Personal Yurt, Bedding, and 4) 700 year old Medieval Pots. The actual losses, Booth and Inventory $9665, Camping Yurt and Costumes $6100,Total, $15,765.The van itself was insured, but the gear was not. I have since researched Inland Marine Insurance (for the gear). I will purchase that when I rebuild my stock. Also have researched GPS trackers, in case of a repeat performance.What am I asking for? I am not expecting the entire amount, Pottery doesn\\'t cost much in materials to produce, and I have very friendly suppliers that will help. But it will take time. The Booth, Costumes, and Tents, that\\'s the real problem. I need to present a Professional Display up to specific standards. The Re-Enactors out there will understand.So please give what you can, any amount will help. The pottery brings in 25% of my income, or I wouldn\\'t ask. Thanks very much for your time and donations. Stop by the Booth, and I\\'ll give you a mug.Ix\\'Chel Dream is a startup company that helps artisans in Guatemala receive fair wages for their work.

Pure. Simple. Delectables.Message from Jerry:The name, Della J\\'s Delectables, was inspired by my mother, Della, who along with my father, Lee, provided the inspiration for everything I do. I added my own modern twist to some of my mothers old world recipes and included a few new favorites, thus Della Js was created.My love for food was crafted out of the need to cook for myself at a young age. From there, I perfected my dishes and shared them with family and friends. I love seeing the look on their faces as they take their first bite from a dish I have created; that alone is worth all the hard work it takes to prepare these delicious foods.

My sister Judy, who has always believed in me, has been instrumental throughout this venture. As a team, we are eager to share our passion for good food beyond our family and friends.

We had to put all of our home and tools into two 10x20 storage units. Do to many unforeseen hurdles over the next 9 months we came to the decision for Tawnya and our kitty boys to go to her Mom\\'s house in Missouri, while I stayed in Colorado to keep trying to find a place. We did not want to do this but we felt it was our last option and since then we have been apart for going on 15 months, missing each other terribly! We have been doing what we can to get back into a place where we can put Dalton Studios back into full swing, but instead we have only been able to just barely keep from losing everything in storage, and staying on top of our bills. We have found a home and thanks to a donation from a friend we are moving in over the next few weeks. What we need now is help in the form of start up funds for our shop or we will not be able to jump start the machine. There are many things we need to do in the new location to have it fully ready for the shop to be functional as well as to insure we have enough money to relocate Tawnya from Missouri back to Colorado. We are worried we will lose the place before we can make it fully operational and for that reason we are asking for help. There will be thank you gifts, hand crafted from Dalton Studios, sent to all who donate.Thank you for visiting our page and feel free to check out Dalton Studios on facebook for a sampling of what we do. Tawnya will have her page up soon with all her beautiful work on display, so watch for links. Thank you again for your support, we simply could not do it without your help!All thank you gifts will be sent out as soon as we have reached our goal or atleast have the glass shop operational.We appreciate donations of any amount and we also have items that are for sale to help with this transition.Dalton Studios https://www.facebook.com/pages/dalton-studios/190901674265359Saludos!

My team and I have\\nbeen putting a lot of research and hard work into this project since June 2010.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Dream Matcher is a social networking website designed to\\nmake dreams come true. It uses complex systems and algorithms to match users\\naccording to what their dreams are, and to what dreams they can make come true.\\nDreams can be relatively small, such as practicing a new language or a musical\\ninstrument, or big, such as meeting a celebrity, or spending time in a hard to\\naccess location. Each one of us has\\ndifferent dreams and wishes; at the same time, each one of us has the ability\\nto make someone else\\'s dream come true. The Dream Matcher will employ its complex\\nsystems to make sure that the right people are matched with each other. Won\\'t\\nthis make many people around the world really happy? (Watch video for more information)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAchieving this simple, yet powerful, concept is not all that easy. It takes months of hard work and dedication from experienced professionals.\\n\\nI am extremely passionate about this project, which I hope one day will reach every single person in this world. I do not want the lack of finances to stand between me and my dream; thus, I appeal for your help.\\n\\nIn October 2011, The Dream Matcher started its official operations from Beirut, Lebanon. We are planning to equip an open space office with the technologies needed to develop The Dream Matcher. During the first 6 months, we are planning to provide at least 15 competitive internship opportunities to students from universities across Lebanon, and to hire at least three full-time professionals, in addition to the current production team. \\n\\nYour donations will be highly appreciated disregarding the amount; you can donate as little as $1. If you have faith in me and my idea, please feel free invite your own friends and family and whomever might be interested to donate to The Dream Matcher.\\n\\nI am working very passionately to make sure that every dream in this world comes true. Making people\\'s dreams come true gives me immense pleasure. However, I need your support to pursue this dream. Please donate to The Dream Matcher. Just as it is my chance, it is also your chance to \"be the change we wish to see in the world,\" as the great leader Mahatma Gandhi once said.\\n\\n\\n\\nNOTE: Please contact me personally before you donate if you are planning to donate more than $50.\\n\\nNOTE: If you are in Lebanon, and since the system does not accept donations from Lebanon, please contact me directlyat 03-048487 or alichehade@gmail.com\\n\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nAli ChehadeFounder and CEOThe Dream Matcheralichehade@gmail.com www.thedreammatcher.comI\\'m back down in The Valley after almost 20 years in Austin and I\\'m trying to do a reboot on a lot of things in my life, Carl\\'s Cheesecakes being one of them. I\\'d baked cheesecakes for all the restaurants and hotels, with a few exceptions, on South Padre Island for years and I want to do it again. There is really nobody doing it around here at this time and like the first time, a niche opportunity is here waiting to be exploited... not that cheesecakes exploits anything but your taste buds.To do that I\\'ll need some revenue to buy pans and ovens and mixers and freezers and all the other incidentals necessary and I need your help doing it. I\\'ve got several restaurants and a couple hotels interested in buying from me again so I\\'m asking for you help to make that happen. I\\'m on a fairly short time frame on this project but whatever happens with it, I love you guys and appreciate the time I spent with you up in Austin and I miss you. Let\\'s get this going again, yeah? Thanks! Eat More Cheesecake!Dear ones,\\n\\nThis is hard for me to\\ndo.  As I put this together, I find all kinds of emotions arise\\naround asking for support and help instead of offering what I can give to\\nyou. Fear of judgement, fear of pity, fear of rejection, sooo many fears I can\\'t even begin to get to the bottom of them in this moment. What I know is I teach people to walk towards their fears, bring them into the light, throw a party for them, exagerate whatever outcome you are afraid will happen....still to post this, to ask for help in a monetary manner left me immobilized, crying on the floor yesterday, only got written because of the help of my dear friend. It truly shows me just how many blocks I have around receiving financial abundance in my life, and although I celebrate and revel in ALL the beautiful things I cocreate in my existence, I long to let go of whatever stranglehold this holds for me. So thank you for being part of my practice, for witnessing my first step, an invitation to allow another to give \"money\" to me, and my surrender to accept whatever it brings up in me, vowing to find the acceptance and love for those hugely scared parts of me. I have spent my entire life adding value to everyone around me, giving more than I would ever \"take\" I love THAT part of me, why do I shun the receptive allowing another to gift me side? If everyone ONLY gave, who would there be for us to give to? So here it goes.......  As many of you know when I left Utah to follow my path, my\\nfamily disowned me.  Over the years, there has been wonderful healing\\nwith them, but in that time, I realized that I needed to shift my idea of\\nfamily.  My community has become my family of choice and so I\\'m\\nlooking to you in the same way I might go to my family for help and support.\\n\\nOne of the hardest\\nchoices I\\'ve ever made was sending my boys to live with my mom for the next\\nyear. I am extremely grateful for the miracle and circumstances that came\\ntogether for this to happen, and for my Mom showing up to support us in the way\\nthat she can.   Over the past 3 years, despite my best efforts\\nto support myself with my teaching and workshops and Nate\\'s efforts, we simply\\nweren\\'t able to make enough money to pay rent and food.  It\\'s been\\nhand to mouth for a long time.  Yet, the last years have also been\\nthe most joyful in my life. I wouldn\\'t trade a single moment..\\n\\nI\\'m committed in the\\ncoming year to getting myself in a place where my business of teaching,\\nfacilitating and individual sessions can fully support myself and my\\nchildren.  It\\'s moving that way rapidly.  It\\'s tender and\\ndifficult asking for help, yet I know that my journey down this path will be\\ninfinitely easier, more graceful, and more joyful if I don\\'t have to do it all\\nmyself.\\n\\nIn taking my business to\\na more profitable level, I desire to create a stronger infrastructure so that\\npeople can more easily understand where, when and what I\\'m teaching.  I\\nneed to be able to have modern communication so I can work on the road.  And,\\nI want to create a nest egg and savings account, so that at the end of this\\nyear, I have a deposit and first month\\'s rent ready to put down so that my boys\\ncan come back.\\n\\nI have so many people I\\nlove and my hope is that you\\'ll be willing to support me.  If all of\\nmy Facebook friends each contributed $1, I\\'d be financially empowered for all\\nof this.  I\\'m asking people to make whatever contribution feels like\\na \"hell, yes\" in your heart and in your budget.  As you know, I make\\nit a personal practice to dive into whatever scares me the most and right now,\\nasking for help in this way scares me the most.  So I\\'m putting this\\nup now.  I\\'ll likely edit it later as well as adding video and\\nprizes.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown for\\nthe money:\\nPhone\\nCalendar\\nWebsite work\\nMeetup groups\\nLibrary of teachings and\\nwisdoms I have collected these past 7 years\\nMonthly Teleconference\\'s\\nbringing our communities together on the subjects that touch us most\\nHeader\\'s, Fliers,\\ntestimonials to really bring THIS work alive\\nDeposit and first months\\nrent\\n\\nOne of my visions is to\\noffer a big party, the date to be determined, as a thank you to everyone who\\nmakes a contribution, however small.  If you have a service or gift\\nthat\\'s easier to offer than money that you\\'d like to make available as a \"Thank\\nYou\" gift to those who are able to contribute more, that would be wonderful.\\n\\nThank you so much for\\ntaking the time to read this.Hi!

Through it all I have strived to keep it relaxing and comfortable, where people can be themselves without fear of judgement. I also have ridiculously low prices, which is why I need your help to create a space in the bar for bands to play. We have an astounding amount of talent in Mobile, and very few venues that enable up-and-comers to get their names out there. I will use whatever money I raise to build a stage, get new sound equipment, lighting, and acoustic improvements. Be sure to check out the rewards for your donations!!!!

She is a native of Miami, Florida where she matriculated in the private, and public schools of Dade, and Broward counties. In her senior year of high school Taryn was a silver knights nominee in speech. She is the daughter of Alister and Sharon Wharwood of Miami, Florida.Taryn was quite impressed by a family friend, Gerilee McLawhorn whom she saw recite poetry in her home one evening. Taryn began her public speaking at the Ebony Village school in Dania, Florida. A school where 3 year old children stood on a tabletop to recite \"The Last Will and Testament\" of Dr. Mary McCleod Bethune. All under the direction, and encouragement of Dr, Josephine Ivey, and Ms. Merita Greene (owners of Ebony Village School). It was there that Taryn developed a love and deep passion for poetry, and public speaking. It was a school where students were engaged in, and participated in many public speaking engagements throughout the Dade, and Broward county areas. All credit to the owners/directors of the school whose vision, and daily mantra that students recited each morning: \"I am Taryn Wharwood, and I have a \"GREAT\" mind!\"\\n\\nBRAVO MOM...Thus where I get my writing talents from. I haven\\'t had contact with Mrs. Green since about high school and Dr. Ivey has since passed but if I had the opportunity, I would tell them both THANK YOU....beyond any amount of gratitude one person could ever show...THANK YOU, for opening this world to me at such a young age. I have a genuine passion for poetry and my passion has afforded many opportunities I would have never imagined I would have.

My name is Chris. I love math and kilts. I have created a new tartan of my own design, based on the Fibonacci sequence, and am raising funds in order to register it with the official registry of tartans.The Fibonacci sequenceOne of the most beautiful series of numbers in all of mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence was described by Leonardo of Pisa , better known as Fibonacci,who wasconsidered \"the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages.\" In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233... or, we can summarize it thus:Fn = F{n-1} + F{n-2}The sequence is closely related to the golden ratio,as the limit of the ratio of consecutive numbers in this sequence, . The golden ratio is found throughout nature, as well as in art and in engineering and science, and is nearly as famous asPi and e. Here\\'s a brief video showing its wonder and beauty.\\n\\nThe TartanLike the Fibonacci sequence, the tartan I have designed is beautiful. It uses yellow, red, dark green, and navy blue to represent the first seven numbers in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. It consists of a1 Yellow thread, then 1 Red thread, then 2 Dark Green threads, then 3 Navy Blue threads, then 5 Red threads, then 8 Dark Green threads, then 13 Navy Blue threads.The DriveI would love to see this tartan officially recognized and brought forth into existence as a magnificient kilt.Registration of a tartan with the Scottish Registrar of Tartans costs 145 GBP (~$220 USD). Once registered, the tartan will be given to the public domain, so that it may be adopted by the clan of math and science enthusiasts, wherever they may be found.Kilts are expensive garments, and a custom tartan is even more expensive. It will cost around 800 GBP (~$1300 USD) to produce the fabric and have a kilt made from it. The kilt will be a traditional 8 yard kilt.Why an 8 yard Great Kilt, and not a less expensive 5 yard kilt? Well, it\\'s actually not any less expensive. For small runs of fabric, a weaver has a minimum order. So to make any of the tartan at all, I\\'ll need to order enough to produce a 8 yard kilt. Besides, it\\'s only fitting that the first garment made from the new tartan be a Great Kilt.The rest of the funds will cover GoFundMe\\'s fees, rewards, and taxes.Rewards!Now that we\\'ve reached100% funding, I have to get to work on the project. T-shirts are being produced, and the tartan registration is being submitted. So I cannot continue to offer these rewards. I\\'ve reached goal anyway -- if you really want to contribute to something, please find another deserving project that needs it. Below are descriptions of the reward levels that were offered when they were available, for reference and posterity:T-shirt After 5 days, the campaign had reached $316 with 10 donations. Beat the average by donating $32 or more to get a lovely Fibonacci Clan tartan t-shirt. Fibonacci FoundersThese special reward levels are now available forthe first person to donate a Fibonacci number to the campaign. The tartan itself symbolizes the first 7 numbers in the sequence. Become the 8th, 9th, 10th, etc. number in the tartan by donating that amount, and your name will be included in the registry submission form as a special thank you! And you\\'ll also get a t-shirt! (Yes, that means there\\'s one t-shirt that will go to the 8th Fibonacci for the bargain price of $21!)Thank you!With great excitement and anticipation we have witnessed the new UofA Chabad houseraise upto the sky!With support from parents, alumni, studentsand friends, the New UofA Chabad house - Rohr Jewish Student Center dream is becoming a reality.

Thank you for taking the time toread and consider our GoFundMe campaign.For those that don\\'t know, we are Robby and Chieko, a husband-and-wife team who had a dream of owning our own bar. We made our dream a reality when we opened Barringer Bar & Lounge at the beginning of 2014. Things were running smoothly and business was great  even though we were a young bar, we were named one of the hottest bars in Houstonby Zagat, and made Zagat\\'s list of hottest bars in America! but when we were abruptly locked outbythe person/bar we were subleasing from downstairs, we were suddenly bar-less (and have beenfor the past3+ months). Whilewe are currentlydealing with a legal fight,we are looking at the brighter side of things and aremoving forward with our dreams of having our own physical bar again.Which leads us to this happy announcement: we are ecstatic thatwe have signed a lease foranother space in downtown Houston! We are looking forward to designing another Barringer witha similarlook and feel as the original: we will pay homage to the deep history of downtown Houston with the exposed brick, antique furniture, and historical archives that we shared with our410 location.Luckily, we are only a few blocks away fromour original location, and the space was previously a bar as well, so the turn-around time should be relatively quick. We arehoping the move will be bigger and better for our business and for our amazing and loyal clientswhohave been patiently waiting with us. The first Barringer was a collaboration of our entire life savings, friends helping, calling in favors, and good old-fashioned elbow grease. This time around, we are fortunate enough to have the same help... minus the savings. The unfortunate truth is that we put all of our personal funds into making our first dream a reality, and now with our legal fight and the work we put into the old location, we are having a hard time doing this alone. Please help us with getting the new bar off the ground!\\nAny amount will do! We know that the goal is high; however, every dollar will go towards materials, equipment, andoverhead to get the doors open.Thank you again and we look forward to serving you soon!-Chieko & Robby(Us looking a wee bit tired after the Barringer grand opening but totally worth it!)Have you ever dreamed of starting a record label? Well, here\\'s your chance! Join us as we, together, found the Hi-Fi Society Collective Record Label. There\\'s even a level where you\\'ll get a cool plaque to impress your friends and coworkers and commemorate your exclusive founder status forever!Oh, and did we mention that I will be the first signed artist? Yep! I\\'ve got a brand new album for you, FORWARD, all ready to release, so the label will be off to a running start! (Listen HERE)This label is happening, and you can get in on the ground floor. Plus, you know that every penny (okay, minus the GoFundMe small percentage) goes straight to the label and to the artist- not to iTunes or any other big company taking their cut. You are buying local, supporting art, going direct, and getting something in return. Once the goal is reached, you can check on what\\'s happening with the Hi-Fi Society and see your name or company name listed there as a badass founder. Hopefully we will raise enough to sign other up and coming acts, too....this is only the beginning! Take a look at Hi-FiSociety.com.Choose the right level for you and come join us! It\\'s gonna be fun!And you\\'ll get my new album FORWARD right away!From Food Truck to Brick + Mortar: Part 1Love, Chimichurri, + The Blue Ridge MountainsAfter moving from Miami, Florida to Asheville, North Carolina almost four years ago with our then infant daughter, we (Nestor + Ashley Teran) became inspired by the many young business owners in town who decided to try to make a living from pursuing their passions. We knew that we could take our talents and turn them into a career! With Ashleys love of design and Nestors amazing abilities in the kitchen, we had a recipe for success. We decided to put our entire life savings (Ashley\\'s inheritance) into the creation of Smash Events, Inc., an event planning, and catering company with a food truck serving both locally in Asheville and at private catered events.Business really took off. In our first season, we did several festivals and one wedding with Smash Box Mobile Kitchen. People began to see the love we put into everything we do. They also appreciated the fact that Nestor is bringing an entirely different type of Latin American cuisine to this part of the country. Through our food, folks are learning that Latin American cuisine has many different flavors! Now, in our third season, we have over 15 weddings, several large multi-day festivals, and lots of regular food truck gigs on the books for 2015 alone. In addition to foodtrucking and catering, in our second year of business we expanded to include complete floral and event design too!Winter is Coming.As a food truck, we can only operate so many hours and days per week. Although we have worked so hard to build a brand and a decent fan-base in Asheville, we are not able to reach as many people as we\\'d like. Our catering business is also expanding at an exponential rate, and we simply cannot continue to grow using our little 12\\' truck as our sole kitchen. We need a homebase for our floral and design side as well. Smash Events needs a home.As we put our entire life savings into the creation of our food truck, we simply have nowhere else to turn than to our loving fans, family, and other investors to help us continue making this dream a reality. We will be personally investing in our transition into a permanent space, but we can\\'t do it alone!A Two-Part CampaignOur campaign will be broken up into two parts. Part 1will help us get into a space, once we find something that suits our needs. Part 2 will help us cover permitting fees, cosmetic improvements, a new sign, and any additional equipment we may need before our big grand opening.We plan to keep Smash Box Mobile Kitchen, to be used for catering and larger festivals. Our clients love the fact that we cook onsite at their events, and catering is something we have very much grown to love! Having a brick and mortar will allow us to share everything we have to offer with a much larger audience.We want to be able to expand our menu to include many of the Latin favorites that we grew up eating in Miami, including many Nicaraguan dishes we cannot create on the truck. We\\'d like to add some of Ashley\\'s Italian family dishes to the menu as well. We\\'d love to expand our work with Asheville City Preschools because being able to create a sense of wonder for kids is EVERYTHING. We envision a coffee counter, with native Ashevillians enjoying small-talk over a colada. We want to provide that kid-friendly, beer-serving, dog-lovin\\' atmosphere that is so integral to the Asheville we fell in love with four years ago. We want live music, brunch on the weekends, the whole nine.Thank you so much for considering contributing to our campaign.I found the beautiful practice called yoga 182 days ago, every single day since I have been healthier, not only physically but most of all but spiritually and emotionally! I have gained so much from finding Yoga with Adriene on YouTube! I am absolutely in love, passionate, dedicated and want to share this beautiful practice with so many others! I had a tough childhood as many others out there have also had unfortunately, so my goal is not to make money from learning what I learn in this school, but to share this knowledge I gain with so many others! I want to dedicate time to rehab facilities, I want to share this beautiful practice and what I learn with children, young adults anyone who has been through any kind of trauma in their lives!!!! I want to give back so much of what I\\'ve already gained in only 182 days of yoga with as many beautiful people as I can! I want to share this love, this happiness that yoga brings into one\\'s life. I\\'m so very, very grateful that I finally after many, many years of talking about giving yoga a shot, THAT I DID. It\\'s changed my life in so very many ways! My happiness and childhood was taken from me at the young age of 9, now I am NOT saying this for pity but am saying this because I can now honestly say that I\\'M HAPPY! Not just a normal happy I\\'m happy within, I feel like I have my childhood back, I actually can say that I LOVE MYSELF, and not in a selfish way in a very good for your soul way! I just feel that this is my path, this is a journey I will forever be on, I want to share what I learn with as many as I can. I want others to feel this love for themselves! I want to give, I\\'ve never felt a need or want to do something so passionately! I want to make a difference in this world even if I only help one person, that\\'s great!!!! This world needs love, kindness, and as much GOOD as we can give it, and I feel that this is the way I can make that difference. So I\\'m asking and I\\'m not one to ask for anything, even my husband lol for money, I\\'m a little too independent on that end, but I\\'m now a stay at home mom and I have no income of my own and I promise you if you could help me, I will give you my word that I will give so much love, kindness, and all those wonderful things yoga has given me back to as many people that are willing to accept that gift! That\\'s the perfect thing to call yoga and it just hit me now.....it\\'s a gift! I want to thank Adriene Mishler for giving me such a beautiful life changing and saving gift! Thank you all. Much love, much peace and much happiness to all. NamasteFor those of you that have known me for a while, you\\'ve been watching my dream of Mountain Mel\\'s Essential Goods grow, & grow it certainly has! I have gone from being a family and community herbalist, to farmers markets, to getting my goods into natural health food stores, and holistic practitioners offices, and now into my own new facility to work out of. It\\'s such an amazing honor, and sometimes I can hardly believe it\\'s really happening! Some of you are probably wondering what I\\'m planning to do out of this new space. The space is going to be called Mountain Mel\\'s Green Canyon Apothecary, in Welches, Oregon. Green Canyon is named after one of the most beautiful places on the planet just a few miles down the road. We will be using the space to continue to produce & grow Mountain Mels online and wholesale business. We will also be opening up a retail space, The Green Canyon Apothecary, to the people of the Mount Hood community, and the millions of travelers that visit this area.Green Canyon Apothecary will be a vibrant, friendly, fresh, clean, and open space. We will be a well stocked apothecary with bulk herbs & oils, herbal products, high quality supplements, and other natural health care supplies. We will be serving teas and smoothies out of the space that will be made from organic & locally grown produce. If you live up here, or travel here often, you know that quick, convenient, nourishing, and healthy food on the go is very hard to come by! We will also be offering classes on herbal medicine and natural living skills. We will essentially be a hub of natural health and well being for the Mount Hood community! A much needed space for us all!Mountain Mels Essential Goods has come a long way, and weve got quite a bit more to go. Heres a sneak peek at the work weve done so far.This is what you see when you enter the space from the outside area. Keep in mind, it\\'s not well stocked yet. ;)This is looking at the front door from our kiddie play corner. Yes, this is a VERY kid friendly establishment! Come in and let your child get lost in our adorable wooden kitchen while you shop & sip herbal tea! We\\'ll even offer herb classes specific for your little ones. :)This is the warehouse space where we store our bulk herbs & finished products. It\\'s also going to be our shipping and receiving room.This is what our awesome crew will get to look at from behind the counter, as they smile and serve you your teas and smoothies! Not too shabby of a space to work! It will look much better with the paper off of the windows. ;) And here it is! Our beautiful shiny new commercial kitchen where all of this incredible herbal goodness will be produced out of! Hip Hip Hooray! Let me tell you, it feels absolutely amazing to make herbal medicine in this space!Ok ok, enough with the pretty pictures, & back to the money and why I\\'m now asking for your help. You see, all of this has cost an awful lot of money! From the rent, construction, paint, furnishings, electricity, equipment, inventory, insurance, advertising, employees, cups, trash bags, jars, and so much more. The list is long, and so is the bill! I don\\'t want to daunt you with too much, because it\\'s really not that much fun to think about. ;) This whole time, all of this money has come from the pocket of my family, putting all of the business money earned back into the business, and a few very close friends who also believe in my dream. I know there\\'s a lot of you out there who love seeing all of this happening, who love watching the growth, and who truly believe in what I\\'m doing, and are incredibly excited for what I\\'m trying to bring to this community. Well, I\\'m now asking for your help! How will this money be used? These funds will allow me to get more inventory for the space, so that we can have more to offer you when you come in. I will be able to buy a new Vitamix and several pitchers to ensure those with allergies & food sensitivities will not be contaminated. I will be able to increase my inventory of Mountain Mel\\'s products, packaging, & labels for the coming season. I will be able to fix the commercial dishwasher, so that I can have sanitary dishes quickly. I will be able to purchase the locally crafted display boxes I need. It will allow me to get more relationships started with local farmers. It will help me to provide new jobs to people! It will help me to get through these first few months of opening a new space, and acquiring a lot of new overhead Really, the money will do so much in allowing me to bring a hub of health and wellbeing to the Mount Hood community & beyond!!The sooner I am able to raise these funds, the sooner I am able to open the doors to Mountain Mel\\'s Green Canyon Apothecary. Many of you have asked when I\\'m opening and expressed a great amount of excitement. Please, help me open sooner!Every little bit helps! $5, $20, $50, $100 whatever you feel you can spare to help me out! So maybe you\\'re incredibly broke too? Trust me I get it! You could help me a lot by sharing this message with your friends, email it, post it on Facebook, send it to someone you think might be interested in helping this dream truly come alive. I will be FOREVER GRATEFUL!!!So yes, I did it. I broke through a fear of mine and what is a great challenge to me. I\\'m asking you to help me make my dreams continue to come true with your generous financial contributions. I\\'m doing this for the love of my family, for the love of my amazing community, and mostly for my love of this beautiful planet! Your contribution helps in ways that my words can not fully express!Thank you so much for reading this long post! Thank you so much for SHARING this post! And thank you so much for contributing whatever you are able to contribute! Peace, Love and Gratitude to You and Yours!!!With the closure of our local Games Workshop store, my husband Andrew (who was the store manager of that location) and myself feel that there is now an even worse lack of places for tabletop and board game players to play in this area and would like to change that. Our goal is to create a place where those who enjoy tabletop strategy games and board games can come and play in a fun and friendly environment with open gaming. We plan to carry a wider selection of miniatures/models, games and painting supplies than is currently available in the area, as well as offer in-house painting services and painting lessons for those who are interested. We have a location chosen for the store in the shopping center at the corner of Harlem and Alpine, part of the funds we\\'ll need to get it up and running and several offers of help for remodeling and getting the space ready. We just need to raise the rest of the money we need to get the idea off the ground. Andrew was the store manager of the local Games Workshop store for close to two years and both of us have prior, long term management and supervisory experience with Circuit City in various roles. We worked together for nearly 10 years and work well as a team. For those who are interested in the painting/etching certficate reward levels, photos of Jenn\\'s painted miniatures and etched model horses can be seen in the photo albums on her studio page at  https://www.facebook.com/ShadowfaxStudio and there are more miniature pictures on the Black Dog store page at  https://www.facebook.com/blackdoghobbyandgame?fref=ts. All models to be painted/etched are to be supplied by the donor that the work is being done for. Model horses that are to be painted should be prepped first if possible. Crocheted items will be started as donations are received so we can hopefully avoid having too much of a backlog at any point in time and painted/etched items will be started in the order they are received. Sample photos of crocheted items will be uploaded to the Black Dog FB page over the next few days.I really need your help. As some of you may know, I started out on the radio in the Summer of 2012 and did fairly well. When I ventured off and begin to do video interviews to highlight people and events, I begin to get an even greater response. With a greater demand and opportunities I find myself not being able to produce as much because of the lack of equipment that I own.I use what I have, however I know that I can give my clients better quality with a little upgrade.

For those that may not know me, my name is Pavla. I\\'m a single mom of two beautiful kids (ages 2 and 7), a bakery store owner and all around go getter. I moved here to the US from the Czech Republic about 16 years ago with only a $100 in my pocket, a backpack and the drive to create my own business one day. Fast forward, I opened abakery about a year ago in a smallBavarian town called Helen which is located in the North Georgia Mountains. With help frommy closest friends, I was able to gather enough money to renovate a small space where I could offerEuropean style sweets including authentic Czech\"kolache\" which reminds me of home. Bohemian Bakery Cafe opened on September 27th, 2014 and my bakery business has been slowly rising since. You can visit to see what customers have to say about us.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/bohemian-bakery-cafe-helenUnfortunately,the building owner\\'s friend, without notice, decided to open a deli next store to me which is a conflict with our (andhis) business because we both offer European style deli sandwiches . They are evictingme and unfortunately there are loop holes that allow him to. He sabatoged my business with threats as well as sending agricultural and health inspectors to mybusiness over the past couple of months. Upon inspection, they saw that I have followed all the guidelines. I am looking to relocate my business but with little notice, I am not prepared to move into another location.After sinking all of my life savings in to starting my bakery, I need help to cover moving expense and to cover the basics to start over. I do not have family here in the US and as a single mom, I don\\'t have a backup income I can rely on. This bakery is the bloodline for my family as well as we have established a great connection with the community.We are asking for your help to raise approximately $15,000 for all the moving expenses, rent deposit, 1st month rent and to cover some of the court fees we have incurred. Anything you can do will help! Even a $1 or $2 or $5 will help! I hate asking for money but I have worked so hard and given up so much to create Bohemian Bakery & Cafe and I would hate to see it fail for reasons out of my control. We have to move out by July 12, 2015and will be temporarily on hold while we search for a new location but we have to secure funds before doing so.We promise to give back to the community when we get the bakery back up and running and will create a wall of thanks for ourgenerous donors. It\\'s my hope that we can save the bakery so thatone day my children can take over and keep sharing our sweets to next generations to come.Sadly,PavlaThank you from the bottom of ourheart for reading our story and thank you for donating and sharing our story with others.Your baker for life.Friends, our favorite local bike shop was firebombed this morning. That bike shop is owned by our good friend, Buster Brown.Buster is out of business until he gets his store rebuilt. I don\\'t know how long that will be, or if insurance will cover everything (I doubt it).Anyone who owns a business knows, that when the business is closed, you don\\'t get paid. however, the bills keep coming. But this goes beyond helping a guy out. Buster is the guy who organizes rides. For free. Helps new riders. For free. Coaches people. For free. Loves on people. Well, love is its own reward, but you know what I mean. He\\'s an important part of the cycling community in Tulsa; a giver.This fund is to help our friend get over the hump. How much you give is not important, but he is our friend, so give a lot! :-)If there\\'s any money left over, we\\'ll donate to Buster\\'s favorite charity.I am raising money to help fund my dream of owning my own clothing store. I\\'ve always dreamed of being a business owner but wasn\\'t able to make it happen for one reason or another. I\\'m done with being afraid to step out on faith so I\\'m planting my mustard seed today by starting this campaign.

Mya is a 2012 graduate of Howard University, holds two bachelor\\'s degrees, has volunteered for and participated with various organizations in Washington, D.C. where she attended college as well as her hometown of St. Louis, MO. Mya was in Ferguson reporting on the developments in the community and engaging youth in protest strategies, on her third night of organizing she was shot in the head. In the time since she has been recovering, Mya has not been contacted by the local police department and no evidence in her shooting has been recovered. Now, Mya is writing a book about her personal experience(s) in Ferguson, recovering from a gunshot to the head, and remaining positive as she continues to impact social change and awareness.

A little while back, I decided to branch out and try new things to stuff eggrolls with. The normal eggrolls are delicious, to be sure, but why not try other tastes? I ended up experimenting with dessert eggrolls and ended up making apple pie eggrolls as my first experiment. After that first bite, I knew then I couldn\\'t stop. Since then I\\'ve come up with lots of flavors - Reubans, Pizza, Mac n Cheese with Bacon for savory eggrolls and Oreo cheesecake, Lemon curd, apple pie, S\\'mores, cookie dough and strawberry cheesecake for dessert eggrolls.I\\'m going to start off with 20 flavors at a time, and then come up with other recipes and I\\'ll rotate in new flavors every month. Future goal will to get a food truck or sell them at local markets, but for now the goal is to get the licensing to make these from my home kitchen and ship them out to everyone frozen.To do this, I\\'ll need the funding to get an air fryer for healthier cooking (requires 80% less oil! Imagine how many more eggrolls you can EAT), a separate fridge/freezer to store the ingredients, ingredients to experiment with for new recipes, and of course, to pay for all of the licensing fees. Starting the goal at $5,000 to see if this is feasible, that should cover the cost of experimenation and finalizing the recipes and testing of shipping containers. If there\\'s enough interest, might even shoot for a cart or a truck!Thank you kindly for all of your help and support, and have a most wonderful day!Hello Cupcakes! The opportunity we have been waiting for has arrived! We are in negotiations with a major Northwest Grocer who would like to sell our cupcakes, donuts, and bread. We have a location to work out of, but we need to raise funds to make this happen. Closing the retail location meant we had to liquidate our assets, so in a way we are starting over. Some of the items needed for this transition include: wholesale packaging, wholesale labeling, fresh raw materials, and new marketing materials. This relaunch means we are switching our business model from retail to wholesale, and allows us to concentrate more on the product, and less on the overhead. In addition, during our time away, we have reworked our recipes and made them better then ever. Ruby Cakes will now be completely soy free, and canola oil free, in addition to being gluten free, vegan, and nut free. We wholly believe our products are the best of their kind, and we cannot wait to share them with you again!In order to make this happen we need your help! You have all heard the phrase \"It takes a village...\" We are asking our village to help with our relaunch. Things move fast in this industry, so the clock is ticking, and every second counts! We need to meet this goal in 30 days, or we will have to walk away from this opportunity. Thank you for donating! We hope to be back to baking for you soon!Love and cupcakes,Amy and DominiqueHELP US KEEP OUR DOORS OPENAfter 30 years in IT, I took an early retirement and invested my life savings (over $300,000) to pursue my dream... and I opened my first business, BuffDog Canine Fitness Center in March 2014. I spent six years developing this concept while working my full time IT job AND working part time at a pet store to gain my Dog Training certification and started conducting dog training classes. Now I am at my wits end because I am running out of money and need YOUR help to keep our doors open.HERES HOW THINGS WENTOnce the business plan was complete, I spent 3 months working with a realtor just to find a building that would approve my business concept. After signing the lease in May 2013, I immediately applied for a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) so that I could make the necessary building modifications and open the doors. I hired part time dog trainers, solicited volunteers to help implement the business plan, and have contracted several professionals along the way to assist with every aspect of getting this business off of the ground. All have worked tirelessly to see that no detail was overlookedAND NOW THE RED TAPEThe CUP is required by the city of Santa Ana to authorize a business to have dogs on the premises. Getting the city to sign off on my CUP took 9 months!!! You may wonder why it took so long. Well, one of the conditions the city imposed on my CUP was for ME to pave the city street in front of the building. Yes, truly! I was mortified. The funny thing is I attempted to find contractors/companies to fill the request. Here\\'s the rub - no private contractors would pave city streets and no company that provided work on city projects would work with a private citizen. It took me additional months to get the city to waive that requirement! I was, however, REQUIRED to install $11,000 worth of lights on top of the building (which I do not own) to satisfy another requirement to get my CUP approved. AND FINALLY after 11 months of paying rent on a building that was generating no revenue, I was finally able to open my doors in March 2014. PLEASE HELP IF YOU CANSo here I am today It has been my dream to have a place where dogs - any dogs  can go and have fun; where dog trainers can come in and have a place to hold their classes LEGALLY; where dogs can run off leash without the fear of bothering other people or other dogs; and where rescue groups can get the assistance they need with the dogs in their possession. I have installed special flooring in the the 13,000 square foot at a cost of over $60,000, purchased supplies and equipment, paid over $100,000 in rents and deposits, hired professionals and paid part time salaries, paid utility costs etc. and have not taken a salary myself. We have a beautiful facility and now need additional operating capital to keep our doors open.PLEASE HELP. No donation is too small. If you can\\'t participate financially, please post/share this link with your friends, family and any organization/Facebook page you can think of. Your donation or social media share helps me and the others who have tirelessly assisted in this dream, to continue to provide a place where dogs can experience a full gamut of activities in a clean safe environment.HERES A LITTLE MORE ABOUT US BuffDog Canine Fitness Center is an indoor facility devoted entirely to the good health of dogs through exercise, training, and behavior modification. Our programs include providing access to dog sports, assisting in rehabilitating troubled dogs, and just having a good time. With the size of the facility  13,000 square foot open rooms - dogs can come to our facility that are overweight, have aggression issues, who are fearful or who lack socialization, and the open space allows them to expend their energy and with free access to the agility equipment and treadmills, they have the ability to achieve an overall healthy lifestyle.buffdogfitness.com https://www.facebook.com/buffdogfitnessWe are outgrowing the house but we need big help to take the next steps towards a storefront! We are working with the local Small Business Association as well as a new business planner in order to give the Neighborhood Nest it\\'s best chance for success. But all plans point to needed funds for equipment, licensing, and build out of the space we FOUND, that\\'s where you come in! Please consider supporting the next step in our adventure in gluten-free baking AND share, share, share, with all your friends and family!Since opening March 5, 2014 The Green Dragon Public House has become a local destination for craft beer drinkers. Although our selection is small, with 8 ales on tap, our customers are extremely loyal and know they can depend on us for interesting libations.This crowdfunding appeal is to help expand our tap selections from 8 to 16. This is an intermediate step before moving to extensive remodeling in an older part of the building to install a walk in cooler. However it is a much needed addition since many of our customers enjoy meads and ciders. This expansion would allow us to consistently keep these on tap, along with more local beers.The $3500 requested would cover the cost of 2 Micromatic Pro Line 8 tap conversion towers, 8 Sankey keg couplers, 2 ea 4 way gas distributors, 2 ea 2 way gas distributors and various hardware and tubing to make the appropriate connections.Labor to install these conversion kits will be supplied by yours truly.So what do you say?

DogTown Lounge is a small pet food company in Richmond, VA, specializing in home-made raw meat recipes and treats for dogs and cats. Every effort is made to use green and sustainable methods and materials in the production process. Working with local farmers we find ways to use every part of their pasture-raised stock so that nothing is wasted. Frozen foods are sold in biodegradable paper containers, treats are in recyclable plastic bags.  Much of the equipment and furnishings for the Lounge have been found or built from scavenged, recycled or thrift store sources.The Dryalata dehydrator used for making Dried Chicken Fingers and other jerky treats, was designed and built from used restaurant equipment, salvaged dehydrator parts and some creative repurposing of scientific laboratory materials. This crowd-funding page is intended to help expand this business in several ways.*  Building a new large scale dehydrator to increase capacity.  *  Repairing a vehicle so that it is reliable for longer hauls to   purchase from more remote farms.    *  Increasing freezer capacity to provide more space for inventory and the storage of raw materials. ... and THE DREAM PROJECT if enough funds are raised:   *  The creation of a pet food truck to bring healthy pet food, treats, and other high-quality pet products to customers beyond the limits of local farmers markets.

Recently the State of Ohio has approved a new permit A1A. Its a special liquor permit for A1 Brewery Production Facilities to open another tasting room within a certain distance of the brewery. The great thing about this permit is it allows the tasting room to have food and a FULL BAR!Our plan is to turn our current WINERY/MEADERY location into an awesomeMartini and Ohio Wine Lounge. Serving food, mixed drinks, martinis and wines from all over Ohio. Our food offerings will include locally sourced meats, cheeses, and vegetables. We will also have a FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE to our current BREWERY TAPROOM AND BOTTLE SHOP.We will have a Mixologist on hand to make delicious martinis, shots or mixed drinks while you enjoy an evening of LIVE MUSIC at downtown Napoleon, Ohio\\'snewest nightlife hot spot.Visitors can make an entire evening visiting our BREWERY for a couple of pints then walk down to the Martini Lounge stocked with a full bar of RUM,GIN,VODKA,WHISKEY and Ohio Made WINES. There is also plans to serve our own Pritchard Distillery spirits at there as well.WHY GOFUNDME and how will the funds be used?The license for the A1A is $3906 kinda steep for a small operation like Flatrock. The funds will be used to secure the license and remodel the space to accomidate more people. The remodeling will include a new sounds system, kitchen equipment and more comfy tables/chairs. By crowd funding we can keep our monthy expenses down enabling us to HIRE MORE STAFF.Thanks for taking the time to review our GoFundme campaign!

       "  'After a couple years of trying to have a baby we began to pray about adoption. Many doors have continued to open as we have begun to move forward through this process. People have come along side us to help and encourage us. We are very excited to use this to help us raise and track the money that we have to use for the adoption. As many people know this is a very expensive process, but we know that God can provide and we are so blessed to know that He could use you to help. We wanted to have a tracker so our family and friends can join us and follow this journey! Contact us if you would like to make a tax-deductible donation.Thank you so much for your help in \"building a Hill\".May God Bless You,Dan and Liana HillBECOMING A FAMILY OF 7: Ty is a student from Moody Bible Institute who came to live with us in January 2014 and quickly became very much a part of our family. In May, his mom (the aunt who raised him) passed away. His uncle, the only father he\\'s ever really known, passed away when he was seven. While Ty does have some connections with his birth family and the cousins he was raised with, we have essentially become his family. We have together chosen to formally pursue an adult adoption. The state of Illinois only requires the consent of the adult adoptee and that the adoptee has lived with the family for 2 years prior to adopting. Our landlord originally granted permission for Ty to live with us for 6 months. None of us anticipated how deeply connected we would become in that short time. He is a son to us and a big brother to our other children in every way. I smile every time he calls us \"Moms\" and \"Pops.\" We recently approached our landlord and told her we were planning to legally adopt Ty and asked permission for him to continue to live with us while he is attending Moody Bible Institute for graduate school the next year and a half, so that we can meet the two year living requirement for adoption. She said yes ... for an extra $350/month. Ty isn\\'t a minor and isn\\'t legally adopted yet, so he falls through a loophole in the lease that would otherwise include him without a rent increase. We have two more years on the lease, so finding another place to live isn\\'t really an option. We either need to pay the extra $350/month, which we cannot afford, or Ty will have to relocate and we will not be able to adopt him. Ty has enriched our family and we will always proudly consider him our son. We would love to make that formal through adoption. Yes, he is an adult. But even adults benefit from having parents, siblings and a place to call home. Our goal is to raise $5,950 dollars to cover the increase in rent needed for Ty to remain with us the next 17 months, so that we can legally become a family.My husband of over 10 years is South African. Our son was born in Malawi where we lived for several years. During those years, I caught malaria many times and our son and I returned to the U.S. in October of 2011. The immigration process is lengthy, complicated and expensive. Any help in reuniting our family would be greatly appreciated.This is my sister.She has been selected as the preferred candidate to adopt a child who will soon be born with Down Syndrome and a constellation of related symptoms.I am asking you to donate a few dollars to help her adopt this child.She has a master\\'s degree in speech disorders, and a PhD in special education from one of the top universities in the field.She is a skilled researcher and program plannerwith a number of peer-reviewed publications.She has several years of experience teaching elementary school special education among some of the most at-risk populations around. She is a director for the Special Olympics organization, and has worked one-on-one with countless special needs children to improve both quality of life and educational outcomes.More importantly than all of that is this: she is an incredible human being with a love for children that surpasses anything I\\'ve ever seen.My sister is the type of person that gives what is needed, even when nobody\\'s asking. Her selfless and caring nature have won her the adoration of all who know her. She is so ridiculously good with children that we all call her the \"baby whisperer.\" Seriously- she should have her own show on TLC.Please consider spending a few dollars to help this amazing, talented individual in her goal of raising a child of her own.Then please consider sharing this opportunity with your friends.Thank you so much for your help and support of Christa and this child who needs her!This is my nephew, Jonah. His mother, my sister, passed away suddenly in 2012 from a pulmonary embolism. Since then, I have had legal guardianship. My husband and I really would like to adopt Jonah.You see, Jonah has had a pretty tough life in his short 7 years. He was born premature at 26 and half weeks and spent the first 3 months of his life in the NICU at Loma Linda. When he went home, he suffered abuse at the hands of his father, causing some head trauma and the detachment of the lens on his left eye.Jonah also has mild cerebral palsy which could be from being born premature or from the abuse (we don\\'t know for sure). My sister and mother worked very hard with the Inland Regional Center to loosen his muscles. We have also worked extensively with occupational therapists to build his gross and fine motor skills. Today, Jonah\\'s CP is hardly noticable. Though he is in a Special Day Class at school, he is learning and growing by leaps and bounds.Jonah has always been a part of my family as my sister and I were very close. She loved me so much, she left me her greatest gift, the person she loved more than anything. I have done my best to fill my sister\\'s shoes and honor her legacy. I love this little boy with all my heart. There is nothing I wouldn\\'t do for him. I have worked with teachers and therapists, I have attended every IEP meeting and conference, I have given him a home and a loving family.Now, I need your help. What I want to give him, more than anything, is a home and a sense of permanence. I need to make sure he is safe, to make sure he can never be taken away from us. My husband and I would love to adopt Jonah, but it is expensive. The basic cost is $2500 for the lawyer and another $5000 for investigative fees. Please help me raise the funds to keep my little boy in the home with people who love him.Thank you so much!Dear Friends and Family,As many of you know, Karlee and I have struggled with infertility for the last four years. This struggle has been difficult for us emotionally, physically, spiritually and financially. We had a consultation with our infertility doctors a few months ago, it turned out the cost of doing another In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) would be much higher than we originally expected. Karlee had a negative reaction to the medication during our first failed IVF that reduced the chances of success. If we attempted another IVF it would require different and more expensive medicine. Karlee was heart-broken to hear of how much the cost rose and that we could not afford to try one more time.Many friends and family have told us that they would love to help with the costs so we can attempt another IVF. My pride has stood in the way of ever doing something like this. But this Christmas, I would like to surprise Karlee with the opportunity to try IVF one more time. She has been so strong through this journey and I know we all want to help her dream of being a mother come true. She has no idea that I am reaching out to all of you and that I have set this up. I have setup a Go Fund Me account where anyone can contribute to this cause.I will be surprising Karlee on Christmas morning so please do not let her know. Please forward this link to anyone that may be interested but please do not share on social media as she may catch wind of it.Thank you all for your love and prayers,CurtisOur Journey:This journey began for us four years ago in December 2011, when we decided we were ready to start having children. Karlee had always wanted to have children and after three years of marriage I finally gave in. Karlees dream job was to be a stay-at-home mom. We were both overjoyed and thankful to God when we became pregnant our very first month of trying. We were both so excited and immediately began combing through possible baby names. Karlee tried hard to wait to make any purchases but it seemed like every other day she saw something she just couldnt pass up and needed for our baby. Seeing our babys ultrasound and hearing the heartbeat was one of the happiest days of our lives.We decided to let family and close friends know about the pregnancy but had decided to wait until she was at 13 weeks to announce it publicly. When Karlee was 12 weeks and 6 days pregnant, it took us a little longer to fall asleep that night. We kept discussing the fun ways we would announce to our coworkers the next morning and the Facebook post for extended family and friends to see. Unfortunately, a few hours later, Karlee woke me up due to some excruciating pain she was experiencing and we rushed to the nearest hospital. I have never seen someone as strong as Karlee was that night, knowing that she was having a miscarriage she endured both the physical and emotional pain. We had many friends visit us in the hospital and Karlees mom flew out to be with her while she recovered. Our church family surrounded us that following week and showered us with Gods love and comfort. We got through that week, knowing that God had a plan and a purpose.We thought since we had gotten pregnant our first month of trying, it would only take a few months to get pregnant after Karlees recovery. The months went by and each month we were disappointed, but tried to remain positive. The months turned into years and we decided to reach out to infertility specialists to see if the miscarriage had caused any damage that may be hindering our ability to conceive. After multiple months of tests, we praised God that there was nothing wrong with either Karlee or myself. The doctors prescribed some medication that would enhance the ability to conceive. Karlee was on this for multiple months and endured the negative effects of extreme hormonal imbalance. When this did not work, the doctors recommended a procedure called IUI. After 3 failed and costly attempts at IUI, our doctors told us that for two healthy individuals, with unexplained infertility and had been trying for multiple years; the next step was In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). We had never imagined coming to this point in our journey to become parents. After much prayer, we decided to go through with the procedure and emptied our savings. During the process, Karlee had a negative reaction to one of the medications. The reaction countered many of the other drugs Karlee was taking and the chances of this IVF being successful dropped significantly. Per the doctors advice, we continued through the entire procedure but a month afterward received the negative results that it had failed. Karlee was both physically and emotionally drained, so we decided to take a step back from the medical route.We constantly struggled with the question of why us and what Gods purpose was. When we moved up to Redding, we saw a huge need in the community for foster parents. We had never dreamed of being foster parents and knew it would be out of our comfort zone. However, we felt maybe God was pushing us in this direction and that we could turn something positive out of our infertility struggles. It took much longer than we expected to become certified and the foster agents we worked with were some of the most difficult people I have ever encountered. We finally started to receive placement calls but instead of the 0-3 age range we had requested, we kept getting difficult calls (like 3 kids under the age of 3 or 10 year olds with behavioral issues). We knew as first-time foster parents, these types of placements would not be healthy for Karlee and I or for the children. After months of these types of placement calls and the emotionally ups and downs, we decided we need to take a step back from the fostering route also.December marks the end of the fourth year of trying to conceive and one year since our failed IVF. Karlee and I both feel that we will become pregnant if we did another IVF without using the medicine that Karlees body had a negative reaction to. A few months ago, we came up with a plan on how to save and pay for another IVF procedure that we thought would be around $10,000. However, after our consultation with our doctor and realizing the amount of the special medication needed it turned out the entire process would cost $18,000. Karlee was heart-broken as we both knew that this was not financial feasibility for us to do.After telling some family and close friends, many said they would love to help. A few suggested setting up a Go Fund Me account. My pride has stood in the way of doing something like this. I have always seen a major role in our marriage to be provide everything my wife needs and wants. Karlees number one desire has been to have a child to love and care for and this is something out of my ability to provide. God has really humbled me through this infertility journey. Karlee and I have grown extremely close through all the ups and downs and God has strengthened our marriage. We both rely much more on God to provide our every need and we both strive to focus on the positives this journey has provided rather than dwell on the negatives. We still dont know if this journey will lead us to becoming parents naturally, through IVF, through adoption or through fostering. What we do know is that God knows the desires of our heart and he has a plan for us.As you all know, Karlee has the biggest heart of anyone I know. Through all of these ups and downs she has remained the positive, happy person we all love to be around. When she walks in the room, she is the life of the party and she brightens everyones day. She is constantly volunteering to take care of everyones kids and she loves to spoil the kids in our lives. I thought that this Christmas, would be an amazing opportunity to shower her with love and provide her with one more opportunity to be a mother. I set up this Go Fund Me account for all of our friends and family that have been a part of this journey and would like to help make this possibility a reality.My hope is to surprise her Christmas morning with this Go Fund Me account and the chance to do one more IFV. Please feel free to distribute this story and link via email but please do not do so on social media. I am trying to keep this as much of a secret and surprise for her.Thanks you so much for all of your love and support the last couple years and please continue to keep us in your prayers.My sister Traci has been a motherly figure to hundreds of elementary school children and a handful of foster kids over the years too, but since she found her soulmate Hardy a little later in life, she never had the opportunity to have biological children of her own.Hardy and Traci have a unique opportunity to adopt 2 beautiful girls from Liberia! They are actually members of Hardy\\'s extended family and are living with a cousin in Liberia under very harsh and grim circumstances. It is the deepest desire of Hardy\\'s whole family that they get these sweet girls, Margret and Monieka, here to America to be raised by Hardy and Traci.Unfortunately, even though the girls are family, it is an extremely costly undertaking. The process is difficult and requires an experienced attorney. It would be so wonderful if you could make a contribution large or small to help these beautiful girls get here to this land of opportunity, to help my amazing sister reach her potential as a mother and to bring this family together to love each other and enjoy life\\'s journey together...Sincerely,Becky FryDear friend,Early in our marriage, God put in our hearts the passion and conviction to adopt a child. Over the past few years, God has been revealing to us through His Word what adoption really means and the way it shows us, once again, a reflection of His unwavering mercy for a humanity created after His own image.At the end of 2014 we found a recognized organization for adoption named Bethany Christian Services of Missouri. After a time of prayer and consideration, we had the strong conviction that we needed to begin our process of adoption with them. We are trusting that this is one of the ways in which God is leading us to establish His Kingdom in our home.This adoption process involves expenses that surpass our budget and current financial capabilities. God provided the amount needed to submit our application form, and weve been just notified that it was approved. Now, the next step is the phase one the home study, training and case management, for which we need to pay $9,000. The phase two cost $13,500 to submit the time of the child being placed at home that include but no limited to hospital planning, preparation of legal and court documents, legal paperwork for birth parents and appearance in court.We are sharing this with you because we know there is no way we could fulfill Gods dream for our family on our own. We know that Gods heart is for homeless and abandoned children to be placed in godly, loving families.  We are eager to be Jesus for a little one who may not know family in any other way. Can you please help us? If not, can you please share our calling and vision with someone that may be able to? We need to reach our $22,500 goal by December 31st, 2015. As for now, we appreciate immensely whatever contribution given or effort you could make for this page to reach others.

We are in the process of adopting 2 sisters from Ethiopia. They are ages 17 yrs and 11 yrs. They are loving and kind girls. We are quite a way through the adoption, but now need help toget tothe point where the Ethiopian government pairs our family with them. The need is urgent, as the oldest sister will soon age out of the system, and both sisters will then be stuck, never again having a chance for a family, or for the medical care needed. Siblings cannot be separated. The older sister has taken care of the youngest sister all of her life, as their mom died when she was a newborn. We believe the Lord Jesus is calling us to take them into our family, and give them love, care, medicine, an education, and the chance to find salvation through Him! Please help us! Even a $5 donation would get us closer.....Thank You!A little five-year-old girl had a big idea: when she grew up, she was going to adopt a child. Her dream was so big that she often pretended her Cabbage Patch Dolls were her adopted children, and as she held them she would tell them their special adoption stories of how they were chosen and loved. She grew up daydreaming about what her adopted child would look like and where it might be born. China? Uganda? The Philippines? Another American state?When she was a teenager she began borrowing adoption books from the library and scouring adoption agency websites, and before she was even old enough to drive she already knew the ins and outs of the adoption process. Her parents, sisters, friends, and grandparents knew that she dreamed of adopting one day. It was her Biggest Dream Ever. Then one summer night at a picnic, she told her big dream to somebody new. This new person told her that everybody would love to adopt if they could afford it, but nobody can afford it, so nobody can ever adopt.Her dream almost died that day. But the idea kept flickering inside her and she couldnt get it out of her head. Even if it was true that she could never afford to adopt her child, she couldnt stop hoping.When she met the man she was going to marry, she asked him if he could ever love an adopted child. He had never thought of adopting before, but the more he considered the idea, the more he liked it. \"Yes,\" he promised her. \"I will love our adopted child as if it were born to us.\"Her dream almost died another day too, the day she almost died. There was a crash, and sirens, and too much blood, and not enough air, and the man she was going to marry and her parents and sisters and grandparents and friends thought they might have to say goodbye to her that day. But so many people prayed that God decided to do a miracle and heal her, and she married the man she was going to marry, and for five years they have waited and prayed and waited and prayed for something very special, and now its time.They are ready to adopt the child that they have wanted for so long. They call it their Davendarling. At first they were planning to adopt a baby born in the United States, but God brought their attention to a special little girl in an orphanage in the Philippines who needs a family, and they took one look at her and realized that she is the one they\\'ve been waiting for all this time. They have found their Davendarling. Now they just need to bring her home.With the help of family and friends, they are confident that their daughter will soon be in their arms. Please help Donna and Jason bring home their Davendarling.Will it be easy? Nope. Worth it? Absolutely.Our Infertility Journey\\nMikie and I got married in 2005 and even though we were 25, we thought we were still so young. So we decided to wait a few years before trying to get pregnant. In 2007, I stopped taking birth control and we said \"whatever happens, happens\" but we weren\\'t going to officially \"try.\" After 2 years of nothing happening and purchasing our new home, we started actually trying and obsessing over temperatures, counting days, and other timing tricks. Then in 2010, I finally talked to my doctor who scheduled tests for both of us. After those results, we were referred to an infertility specialist who basically told us our best option for pregnancy was IVF (in vitro fertilization). We weren\\'t ready for all of that at the time--and definitely did not have that kind of money--so we asked to try artificial insemination first (which is a lot cheaper). We tried that twice within those next couple of years, but it was unsuccessful. The stress and heartache of what we were dealing with, and looking at going forward, was too much and we decided to take a couple years off from obsessing over it and just relax--even though I secretly hoped for a miracle every month, but alas (at least) 24 more negative pregnancy tests later, still no Baby Lowe. Then in 2014, our infertility clinic started offering something called Natural Cycle IVF--less drugs, less eggs, and (most importantly) less money. We were excited about this opportunity and did our first IVF cycle that year. We ended up with 2 little baby embryos! We were so excited to transfer one of them, but right before Christmas we got the news that it didn\\'t work and I wasn\\'t pregnant. We were so disappointed and sad, but we had hope for our other little frozen embryo and for the start of a new, fresh year. In May of 2015, we transferred the frozen one and were so overjoyed and grateful when I turned out to be pregnant. But, unfortunately, that Baby Lowe became our Baby Angel and is waiting on us in Heaven. We were so devastated and so heartbroken over our loss and what we thought was our only chance. But even though it\\'s still painful, we pushed on because we refuse to give up on our dream to be parents. In 2016, we refinanced our house, cashed out stocks, borrowed money from family, and scrounged every penny we had, and we actually went through 2 more IVF cycles. Both were failures, we didn\\'t even end up with any viable embryos. This whole journey has been so emotionally draining and frustrating. We just don\\'t understand why something that should be the easiest thing in the world is so hard for us. Friends tell us we\\'re strong, but we don\\'t feel very strong--we couldn\\'t have survived all of this without God giving us His strength and showing us the way, and without a lot of people praying for us. We have this desire in our hearts to be parents, and we have faith that the desire is not there for no reason. And so, after a new procedure, we have decided to try one more time (maybe 4th time\\'s a charm?), and we are praying that this time is the time God has planned for. And if not, we will just have to move on to other options, because as I said before, we will never give up! So today we are asking for financial help (since we have cleaned out all savings, etc for the other 3 times), believe me any little bit will definitely help. We hate that we have to ask for donations for this, but you know the saying \"desperate times calls for desperate measures,\" and we are so desperate to get our Baby Lowe and finally have the family that we have always dreamed of.\\nThanks and love,\\nLori & Mikie LoweHave you ever met a couple that just clicks together? A couple that brightens your day by being around them? A couple that is continually knocked down by life yet pulls it together and presses forward. This is Nicole and Jon. This is the couple whose story needs to be told and I hope funds can be raised to help them with the fertility treatments to become the parents they deserve to be.Ive known Nicole for over a decade. She is the friend who will drop anything to be by your side. She will put aside the pain in her heart in order to be genuinely happy for her friends and family. As long as I have known her, she always wanted a family but waited to find the right guy, a good guy. Lets be honest, thats a mission in and of itself. In 2010, Nicole finally met Jonathan. The man she always hoped and dreamed for - a man that treated her like the queen she is. After a few years of dating, Jon and Nicole exchanged vows in May of 2013.After becoming married they decided to start a family. Nicole has always suffered from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. PCOS is where a womans hormones are out of balance and your periods can become irregular making it difficult to become pregnant. In June of 2014, after a year of trying, Nicole was overjoyed to see a bright plus sign on her pregnancy test. Unfortunately, on July 2 at 7 weeks pregnant, their world shattered. Nicole miscarried and they were both distraught by the sudden loss of their first child. As a close friend seeing the pain in her eyes, it is a hurt I wouldnt wish on anyone. After grieving their loss, they decided God had a plan; they kept their faith strong to move forward and not give up on their dream of having a family. After another 6 months of trying Nicole and Jon were blessed with another chance of becoming parents. The sense of delight they experienced after seeing another positive and another opportunity was overpowering. They had their first ultrasound at 8 weeks. This appointment crushed their souls. During the ultrasound the technician delivered the heart wrenching news that although their baby was growing perfectly, the baby implanted itself in Nicoles fallopian tube (ectopic pregnancy), which could be deadly not only for Nicole but for their baby. Nicole was immediately brought to the ER, had surgery and on January 30, 2015 they lost their second child and Nicole lost her left fallopian tube. With now only one working tube, still having PCOS and over 10 months of trying again, Jon and Nicole decided to seek a fertility specialist. This was a decision they did not take lightly. They believe God has a plan for them however, with one working fallopian tube she will never know if she actually ovulates. Nicole and Jon are hard working (If you know Greeks-N-Sweets you know the many hours Nicole works) however, even with her ability to create beautiful and inspiring cookies the cost for the treatments are currently out of their reach. They do have insurance, however, their insurance doesnt cover the treatments they will have to undergo. If Nicole or Jonathanever helped put a smile on your face, you will find it in your heart to donate to this worthy cause that will help put a permanent smile on theirs.Hello, All! We are thrilled to be in the process of adopting our 3rd child...a sweet baby girl from South Korea. As many of you know, this path is long, tiring, and filled with MANY UNKNOWNS. But, what we DO know is that God has chosen us to be her forever family and we are beyond blessed. We love her already! This process is costly on every level, but her little life is WORTH IT! Every child\\'s life is precious and they all deserve a family. Dan and I know that we are called to walk this road. And, we are inviting you to join in our journey:to SHARE IN OUR MIRACLE. Giving to the cause of adoption is a tangible way to really make a difference in the world:in HER WORLD and in ours. Would you consider contributing to our adoption fees and travel expenses?  We have been working towards this adoption for a year and a half now and have already paid some of our costs. We are starting this fundraiser to help us with the remaining fees and with our considerable travel expenses. We have payment deadlines for the adoption fees in July and in Oct. Then, we will just need to focus on our travel costs. We are required to travel to South Korea twice. We don\\'t have any definitive dates for travel, yet. The best estimate is that it will be sometime between Jan and May 2014. The first trip will be to MEET TESSA and to attend a court hearing for her visa approval. Approximately a month later, we leave for the second trip to finalize her visa and citizenship and to BRING HER HOME. Because we are only given 7-10 days travel notice, these trips are very costly. But, like I said before, she is worth it! And, at the end of this journey, a little girl will have a forever family and we will have our daughter. To us, that is priceless!  We are so grateful for all the love and support we have been given in the past. We have been so blessed! Our two amazing boys are a constant reminder of God\\'s faithfulness to us. And, Dan and I have felt His hand at work in EVERY DETAIL of this process. We TRUST that He will see us through! Know that we are so grateful for any and every donation:and for your PRAYERS. They are equally as valuable to us. Thank you for caring for our family and for our baby girl on her way home. Every dollar given is one step closer to wrapping her in our arms!!!  With love and gratitude, Dan, Misty, Bryton, & Beckett...and Baby Tessa :)Shortly after our wedding, we knew that our family was not complete with just the two of us. We both dreamed of having a life that included a child. A boy, a girl, a basketball player, a dancer, a pitcher, a musician, we didnt care. A year after our wedding, we began the journey of starting our family and what a journey it has become! Together, we have decided that we are being led through this process to adopt the last piece of the puzzle in order to make our dream of a family a reality.We are now reaching out to you, our friends and family, to share our news and ask for your support. First we would like to ask for prayer for us and prayer for the adoption in general. While we know that adoption is the course we are supposed to take, there a few pieces of the adoption puzzle we are still trying to find in the box. So prayer for clarity as we look for those final pieces. The second prayer request is for the birth mother. Kind of like dad\\'s heart transplant meant that someone had to lose a loved one for us to keep ours; an adoption means that the birth mother will lose a child for us to gain our family. There is a loss there. So pray that God will calm the birth mother\\'s heart and to know that we will care for the child the best that we can, and that we will raise the child in a Christ centered way.While we believe this is where we are being led, this path is not without its hurdles. The main hurdle is the cost of the adoption. The overall cost is...wellits a lot! So, we are beginning with the first of four fundraisers. In this first fundraiser, we are literally asking you to help complete our puzzle. Here is how it worksWe have a 1,000 piece Disney puzzle. Our life together started with a Disney wedding, so what better way to start our childs life than with Disney as well! We are selling each piece of the puzzle for $15. On the back of the puzzle piece, the name of each donor will be written. By purchasing a piece, you will have your name on this puzzle helping to start our childs story and supporting our journey. Once each piece has been sold, we will put this puzzle together. The puzzle will then be framed, with the names of each donor facing out, and we will hang it in our childs room so that he/she will have a reminder of the love that helped bring him/her into our life.We want to hit the ground running, so here is our goal. We want to have the entire puzzle sold within six months. Ambitious? Yes! Fast? Yes! While getting each of you to purchase one piece would certainly help us to reach our goal, purchasing multiple pieces would help us achieve our goal even faster. We believe this is the path on which God has placed us, and we are grateful to each and every one of you for your prayers, love and support! Here is how you canpurchase a puzzle piece...simply click on the Donate linkand purchase your puzzle piece. We will then write your name onyour part of the puzzle.If you would rather mail a check,send either of us a message and we can give you our address.These precious girls are Rebekah\\'s four newest sisters and they are excited to finally welcome her home to join our family.  They each havetheir own stories of how God miraculously provided for them to come home too! Now it\\'s Rebekah\\'s turn! She has no idea what love lies ahead and the wonderful things God has planned for her precious life! Until just over one year ago, none of us had a clue what it would mean to adopt a child with Down Syndrome. 8 year old Abby changed all of that- and we are all convinced that our lives will never be the same again! So much so, that we are throwing our arms wide open to a second child from China with Down Syndrome... A six year old little girl, soon to be given the nameRebekah Charity McCary! This precious child (pictured below at a summer camp) was abandoned when she was 2 and 1/2 years old and without a family of her own, faced a very bleak future. But God reached down and chose her- much like He reached down and chose each of us! It is an honor and a great privilege to be a part of His plan for this precious, little girl, half a world away. We\\'d like to ask if you might consider what \"small things you can do\" to help us, \"and together we can do something wonderful\" in the life of one young girl.Just like our other 4 adoptions, Rebekah\\'s journey home is long and expensive. Our costs for her adoption fromChina totals about $30,000. Unfortunately, with only a few weeks until Lori travels to bring Rebekah home, we still have a financial need of approximately $15,000. This is not new to us and we have watched in the past how God has ALWAYS provided for each of our girls to come home. He has never failed! Our faith is unshaken and we believe that He will do the same again. We simply ask that you consider how you might be a part of His provision for our family. If with financial assistance- we would be humbled and so grateful. If with diligent prayers on our behalf, even more grateful! Our needs are great on every side and we desperately need the prayers that strengthen us and keep our eyes securely fixed on Christ.  Lori will travel to China again without Doug (and will take a friend and one of our girls), because he must remain at home to not only care for Abby in Lori\\'s absence, but also to stand vigil with Rachel as she waits for the gift of life through a heart transplant. She is presently at the top of the transplant list and the phone call we have waited for could finally come. Much help would obviously be needed from every side should that occur while Lori is away, but we are ready and confident that the God who has orchestrated it all, is also sovereign over every single detail of this journey. We trust Him and humbly ask that you remember us as you pray in the coming weeks and months. God has already graciously supplied almost half of our financial need for Rebekah\\'s adoption. But our accounts are still short the remaining $15,000. needed to complete her adoption, even now as travel draws so near. These funds are needed for the bulk of our travel expenses and to pay the Chinese orphanage \"donation\" of over $6,000., in addition to the other agency and legal fees required.  All donations will be applied to these adoption expenses and then ongoing medical and therapy expenses for Rebekah\\'s care when she gets home.May God bless you as you give to bring HOPE to one of \"the least of these\" in His name.We are so grateful for your support! Thank You!!Hi Friends,As you know, Bobby and I would love to share our lives with a baby. Unfortunately, we are experiencing technical difficulties, so we. need. help. The different options available to us (and others in our situation) are crazy expensive and NOT covered under insurance. Bobby is finishing his BA and working part time, and I am doing work I am commited to and enriched by in an amazing non-profit, yet, needless to say, neither of us are making a ton to save.  We are both commited to spreading love in the world, and we would love to do so by raising a child. I think we would be great at it:)  \\tSo many people in our community have donated to us through our wedding fund (The community raised $9,000!!), but that is still about 10-13 thousand dollars from our final costs. Sooooo, we are expanding the fund raising with this effort. If you have any ability to contribute, that would be wonderful. THANK YOU sooo much!Love and Peace,Clare and BobbyWildhack-Nolan-CainWe are raising money to help my family out and take care of any financial needs that present themselves. Anything you can contribute to get us as close as possible to our goal will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to contribute what you can, my family & I greatly appreciate it.Myhusband and I have a great life! We have a beautiful home in a perfect neighborhood. We have the world\\'s greatest dogs, and we\\'re surrounded by a crew of amazing friends and family.But the one thing our life is missing is a little one to enjoy all of this with. Unfortunetly we are unable to have a little one on our own. This is our only option and will go with full force to bring a baby into our life.We are not ready to give up!Obviously, with all of our medical bills from trying to get pregnant and now to adoption fees, this is where you can come in. With such a huge financial hurdle in front of us, we have to turn to people like you, so we can do everything we need to do to bring a baby into our home.Every little bit helps, and we appreciate your generousity!!! Much love,Amanda & TonyWhile I had hoped to avoid a final appeal through GoFundMe, the events of the summer for our family have put us in a financially tight situation.We have a remaining balance of about $750.00 with our attorney. The girls\\' new birth certificates have arrived, but we cannot pick them up without paying off our balance, which means we cannot change their legal names with everything from the school district to doctor\\'s offices to their health insurance.Four months ago, my dad unexpectedly died. It was a terrible shock, and we are still grieving deeply.In September, my husband resigned his position as pastor of youth and worship ministries because he was so totally overwhelmed by a recurrence of his depression, in part triggered by the amount of stress due to the adoption process, and exacerbated by losing his father-in-law, whom he dearly loved.The church was very generous to us in providing a severance package, but we simply can\\'t make our budget stretch to accomodate $750.We are asking for your help this one last time.Thank you so much.Adam and I have been together since 1999. It was fate that we met. My grandfather went in for open heart surgery & when they opened him up they realized it was too complicated and he\\'d have to be transported to United Hospital for the procedure. While waiting for him to come out of surgery at United I had lunch in the cafeteria, where I met Adam. It was love at first site! I knew right then, he was the one I wanted to spend my life with. About 3 years in we decided to start a family but couldn\\'t get pregnant. And we just kept telling ourselves to be patient. We waited. And waited. But no luck. So we went to the Dr. Adam had a low count and his semen were clumped together at the tails!  All of his swimmers were going in different directions, but not really moving because they were stuck together. At that point, we decided to try insemination. We went through 4 rounds before our Dr suggested IVF. We weren\\'t ready for that so we asked for other options. We were sent to a urologist who told us Adam had a veicole vein that needed to be repaired in his scrotum. They said that may be the cause of the clumping. Adam was not excited to have this surgery, but he wanted a baby of his own & went through with the procedure. It was a success! His count skyrocketed & had many less clumps! The Dr said give it a year to heal. We waited again. Still nothing. We decided to go ahead with IVF . This  was truly the hardest thing we have ever been through. The emotions were endless. I cried uncontrollably through the whole process, man the hormones they give you! This also didn\\'t work and we spent so much money! That was a tough pill to swollow. We decided to give up trying for a while. I just wasn\\'t ready to try again.Fast forward 2 years. We decided to think about coming up with the money to try IVF again. While we started talking  about this, I was approached by a woman that had a pregnant daughter that was giving up her baby that is due 04/22/16! This was 4 weeks ago! Yes of course we want to adopt her baby! But with only another month to go, we\\'re struggling to come up with the money. This was not planned by us, but by our higher power! We have never wanted anything more than this! Our baby girl is at our finger tips! We desperately need your help!  We must come up with enough money for both our lawyer and hers, as well as travel expenses. We\\'re asking for your help and support through all of this. Any donation, big or small will help! Please consider our cause!The DeFrees family is following God\\'s call to adopt a baby girl from the country of Haiti. \"As I closed my eyes to fall asleep, I saw a profound image that I\\'ll never forget. I saw a photo of our familyalmost like a Christmas card photo with myself, Mindi, Dawson, Davian, and a little African-American girl. My weariness left me, and I began to weep. I instantly knew God had been leading us to this point\"To read the full story of our adoption journey and to stay updated, please visit our website at  www.jeremyandmindi.comand click \"Haiti Adoption\".

Thank you for taking the time to read a little about my\\nhusband, Cody, and myself (Anna).  I also\\nwant to thank you for potentially sharing with us in our dreams of becoming parents!\\tI would like to start about telling you a little about Cody and myself.\\nWe are both in our early 30\\'s and are an active couple who love the\\noutdoors including camping and hiking.  Cody rides his dirt-bike with friends when\\nhe\\'s not tinkering around in our garage. As for me, I play on a non-competitive\\nvolleyball league and coach 8th grade girls volleyball.  I also love to be at home and read a good\\nbook or two.  \\tCody and I have a strong, loving relationship; we are each-others best\\nfriends and have been described by others as a \"good, solid couple.\"\\nOur family also includes two dogs, Martha (who is a bloodhound) and Henry\\n(who is a rescue).

They have already met their goal of $15,000 to go into contract with the \"Little Angels\" adoption agency, however, to finish the process they will need to ask for a little bit of help from their friends, family and community. The additional $12,000 requested in this fundraising attempt will be used to provide the birth mother with neccesities (ie, rent, medical, or living expenses) as she grows our future star, home study fees (to ensure we are equiped to house a baby),travel fees to meet the birth mother and finalization fees. Please help us reach our goal and shower our future baby with the love that we have.Hi friends! Thanks for visiting our GoFundMe page. We are raising money to bring Baby Feuille home and hope that you will join our story by contributing financially to our adoption! A little bit about us: We have been married for six years and have been trying to get pregnant for just about three years, but have some complications that make it very hard for that to happen. Since we have always wanted to adopt, we have decided to move forward in faith, trusting that God is going to provide for our every need. Adoption is not easy, emotionally or financially. It is a very real choice to love and sacrifice, but ultimately we choose adoption because we believe that God has something beautiful in it.While we will be contributing significantly to our own adoption, we humbly ask that you would consider partnering with us financially so that we can bring our baby home.  The agency cost is $35,000. All money contributed to our adoption will be going directly from us to the agency.We are adopting domestically from an agency in Houston, Adoption Information and Counseling Services . We have completed all our paperwork and are just waiting on that phone call that to tell us we have been matched! Funds are due at that time, and since there is no way of knowing when that may be, we are moving forward in the fundraising process so we can have all our finances in order as soon as possible.Thank you in advance for your prayers, love, support and all around good vibes. We hope you will become a partner in this beautiful story God is writing for us!Boy meets Girl, they become friends, they fall in love, they get married...the rest is history. Usually their family starts to grow is the next step....usually is the key word here. It wasn\\'t an usually for us, as we have been trying for several years to have a child and with no success we still remain a small family of two even though we\\'d love to be more than two.We\\'ve tried a lot of different treatments under the sun to help us overcome infertility and to expand our family. Sadly, our family wasn\\'t/isn\\'t expanding so easily. We have spent the last 3  years trying to conceive and the last 2  years of that with the help of doctors doing treatments and searching for a reason for our difficult struggle. It is/was very expensive spending these 2  years (almost 3) at doctor appointments that are not covered by insurance; and each step seems to end in the heartbreak of not achieving success. We have tried several different treatments:natural herbal vitamins (fertility blend, etc),clomid, IUI (10 failed ones -- some with clomid, some with injectables, some with letrozole),  acupuncture ...we also tried old wives tales. If you suggested it, we already tried it and yes we relaxed through it all (took vacations, planned other things to keep our minds off of it and any other unsolicited advice that was gave as a trick to get pregnant) and still no success. Our doctors next suggestion for us would be IVF as nothing else we have tried has gone through and it all has ended in the results of us not being pregnant. We want and continue to fight for our dream, which is to be parents. So with that being said, here we are stepping out on faith and prayer and moving forward with IVF. It is expensive (around the price of $18,000.00) and invasive, plus it can be quite scary as it doesn\\'t always work (50% chance of working with our age). Nonetheless we are still stepping out on faith; as we no longer want to hold off on taking that next step for the fear of what if this fails like everything else. We realized that we would regret not trying and we would regret never knowing if it will succeed more than if we never tried at all. Time isnt on our side, the longer we wait the less chance of success we have, so we would like to be able to raise at least $5,000.00 to pay for some of the cost for the IVF. Even though our dream of being parents and having a child isnt coming the way most people were/are able to conceive children. We can still have it become a possible dream and a reality with the help of doctors and an IVF. We would really like a chance like others have; who havent dealt with infertility, to become parents to a child that shares our genetics. This is our main reason for pursuing IVF versus other family building options at this time and we hope to have your support.So here we are at this step in our road that we never thought we have to take. We are not asking to raise money for the whole treatment, but just for a small part of the procedure. We are hoping to raise the goal of $5,000.00 by August 27th, 2015, which is the next doctor appointment we have regarding treatment and cost, an appointment that is exactly two weeks after our 4 year wedding anniversary. Please if you are able to donate we appreciate it. Any amount would help...even if you donate $2 dollars, $5, $10, $50...etc.  We thank you in advance for helping us to keep fighting for our dream to become parents. It means a lot to us and we hope it is in your heart to help us achieve this dream even if it is with a small donation. Also if you rather donate another way, don\\'t hesitate to email us. Peace, Love and Blessings, from our family to you.Dear family and friends:Infertility is not something we ever thought we would be facing. Asking for your help is not easy for us, and posting this leaves me feeling incredibly vulnerable and exposed. We have been trying to start our family for over a year now. This week we got devastating news that I am in ovarian failure. This news shocked us to our core and left me feeling like I was suffocating. We were absolutely crushed. Something that is so simple for so many will not only be very expensive, but also has a very small time limit of possibility. I\\'ve wanted children for as long as I can remember. It wasn\\'t far into our relationship that Brad and I talked about our love for the kids in our life and how we couldn\\'t wait until we could start our family. Last November we began the journey of trying to start our family. Something we thought would happen quickly and easily, didn\\'t. We waited 10 months, every single month ending in heartbreak and disappointment. We began fertility testing with a Reproductive Endocrinologist (\"RE\") in September. After finishing the majority of expensive testing and only finding a small issue on Brad\\'s side (low morphology) we were told we were great candidates for a medicated/IUI cycle (intrauterine insemination). I picked up the medication and we were ready to start this cycle on 11/12/14. We were hopeful and excited that we would finally be starting our family. That morning I had to go in for bloodwork to check 3 hormone levels before we started the IUI process (this was cycle day specific blood work). That afternoon I got the results that my FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) was 22.5. Anything over 10 is considered high. The doctor cancelled our IUI cycle and had me begin a Clomid Challenge Test. From cycle days 5-9 I took 100mg of clomiphene citrate each day. On the 10th day (11/19) I went in for a repeat FSH blood test. Late that morning I got the call that crushed our world. My level had raised to over 37 which meant I had not responded to the medication. The next morning we went in for an appointment to meet with our RE. He went over the results and also did an ultrasound to see how my body reacted to the medication. I had 1 egg on each side, measuring 1mm in size. This was a very poor response. Our RE believes I am in ovarian failure. I have a 2% chance of getting pregnant and only a couple of months to try. My hormone levels will continue to get worse. Asking for help is not something Brad or I am any good at doing. We never thought we would be in the position that we are in. Not only do we have to spend an incredible amount to try to have our baby, but we only have a couple of months to try. If we had been told IVF would be our only hope, but that we had more than enough time, we would never ask anyone for help. Unfortunately, we don\\'t have the luxury of time to save money and finance this in a good way for ourselves. We had saved some money to use as a downpayment on land we were hoping to purchase (to someday build our dream home on), but now we will be using that money towards IVF. Because of our chances and time limit, we are probably going to be using the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine. This clinic has incredible statistics (which is why it is so expensive). Their statistics with patients in my situation are good. Brad and I are not willing to give up on the chance to have OUR baby yet. We will have 1 chance to have our baby and try IVF, so we are going to give it all we can. My brother and his family live near Denver so we will have a place to stay for free, and can also get cheap flights on Frontier Airlines. We don\\'t expect to get our IVF journey covered completely, heck, we don\\'t even expect much as far as donations go.....but we had to put this out there and try. We are sorry for even having to ask, but we truly need your help. Brad and I are meant to be parents. While this is not the way we thought we would be starting our family, we are hopeful to start this journey and bring home our baby. We could use all of your thoughts and prayers as we embark on this scary journey. With love, Amy and BradWe have been trying to have a baby since February 2010. After 4 miscarriages we went to see a reproductive endocrinologist and did 2 insemination cycles and then tried 2 invitro cycles. The doctor thinks that there is an issue with Caroline\\'s eggs. We really want a baby so we are hoping to adopt! We are super excited and are hoping to get a new born baby. We used our savings to cover the medical bills and the first of the specialist doctors visits and had to take out a loan for the invitro, that we are still paying on.

As most of you know Kristen & Jesse have been undergoing fertility treatments for about 2 years now for unexplained infertility. After no success from 6 rounds of IUI they moved on to IVF last spring. After getting pregnant and miscarrying on their first round of IVF they did 2 more cycles with frozen embroyes with no success. That means they had to start over from the begining. This process is very expensive and Kristen has been working her butt off to raise the money to begin another cycle this summer. She would never ask for money but I was asked if she had a Fund Me account and several other friends agreed that it would be a great way to show our support and love for her.

Weve prayed about whether this is the right course of action for us and have felt affirmed that this is the next step in our journey.Its an expensive venture and the final hurdle in moving forward is the financial barrier. Unfortunately, Indiana isn\\'t one of the fifteen states that provides insurance coverage to couples pursuing fertility treatment. The expense of IVF is $15,000. Asking for support for something so personal is very humbling. We dont want anyone to feel pressured or obligated. However, if you do have a desire to contribute, we have committed to run the Monumental Half-Marathon on Saturday, November 7, 2015 and would love for you to consider making a gift of $52. That is $2 per mile for each of the 13.1 that well both run. If financially youre unable or dont feel called or inclined to, we absolutely understand but we still covet your prayers.IVF is not a guarantee but we want to give ourselves the best chance possible and that means reducing stress. So we dont feel any extra pressure, we arent going to share the exact date of our procedure. We can say we hope it will be sometime in the first three months of next year. If the first attempt is unsuccessful well optimistically have another opportunity to try again at a much reduced price tag. To learn more about IVF, visit  http://www.resolve.org/family-building-options/ivf-art/in-vitro-fertilization-understanding-the-process.html. Were certainly praying well have success on our very first try. If by chance, we raise over our goal and our first attempt is unsuccessful well use the additional monies towards our second round of IVF. If it is successful, wed like to use the monies to start a donor advised fund to help other couples facing the same trial.For those that contribute over $50, youll receive an Operation Baby Beckwith dog tag necklace that will be engraved with Matthew 19:26, With God all things are possible.\"If you are a parent or grandparent, you know that children are the light of the universe. I find myself in tragic circumstances and need your support. My name is Jeff Coutts and I need your help to adopt my grandsons- Jaxon and Izzy.On Thursday, February 26th, 2015, I learned that my beloved daughter Stephanie was a missing person. On Sunday, March 1st, I was informed by the Coroner\\'s Office in Clark County , Nevada that Stephanie was dead. She was twenty-nine years old.I immediately went to Las Vegas to attend to the heartbreaking details. I then went to California where my grandsons Jaxon (aged 9) and Izrahel (nicknamed Izzy, aged 7) were staying with Izzy\\'s paternal grandmother. It was up to me to tell my young grandsons of their mother\\'s passing after which I intended to bring the boys back to Denver , Colorado , the home they\\'d known for nearly all of their lives.Stephanie - a single mother - and her sons had lived with me since Izzy was an infant. I knew firsthand how difficult it was to be a single parent as I myself had been a single father, raising Stephanie and her older brother on my own for twelve years, thus I did all I possibly could to offer a loving, stable home to the boys, a devoted grandfather doing the fathering. In addition to all the everyday parenting chores, I infused my grandsons\\' lives with my own passions: a love of music, cooking and the great outdoors. Our trio was happiest hiking and biking in Colorado .My daughter and my grandsons were my life and I, theirs. Having lost my own father at a young age, I was determined to model love, affection, healthy living and communal citizenship, the latter of which I learned and lived while serving on submarines in the United States Navy.Last July, seeking new adventures, and wanting to live near the ocean, Stephanie and her sons moved to California ; Stephanie had planned on temporarily living with Izzy\\'s paternal grandmother until she could get on her feet and find an apartment of their own. I was heartbroken to see them leave Colorado , but proud of Stephanie\\'s self-confidence and her assertion for independence.Now, in the midst of my own agonizing grief, I need to be stronger than ever before for my grandsons. I\\'m currently in California , in a custody battle with Izzy\\'s paternal grandmother, a women who sent the boys to school - without any counseling nor support - the very day after they learned that their mother was dead. I have only been able to see the boys for short amounts of time, on supervised visits, while they are grieving. Clearly, this situation is not in their best interests.Though there has never been much influence nor interaction from either of the boys\\' fathers, nor is there any guarantee that the boys will be able to stay together if Izzy\\'s paternal grandmother keeps them, she is fighting for custody of both boys, the motive of which appears to be the monetary gain as she had told Stephanie  that she needed to move out , effectively evicting her and the boys from the home.\\nI have text strings from Stephanie to her network of friends in California desperately seeking a new place to live and now that Stephanie is gone the paternal grandmother of Isrehal is fighting me for custody of both boys?. Why?It\\'s difficult to ask for help, but I urgently need it. I have to pay for all the legal fees associated with an emergency hearing and custody proceedings as well as living expenses in California until I can leave with the boys. Moreover, instead of readying for my retirement, I will be raising my grandsons. The expenses ahead are daunting; the immediate concern is getting Jaxon and Izzy the counseling they need to deal with their staggering loss.I know what is best for my grandsons. I know the life that Stephanie would have wanted for them. \\nThese boys need to stay together as they only have each other, my son, Jake, their uncle and me left of their Mother, Stephanie.\\nJaxon and Izzy need to be in a nurturing, supportive and healthy environment with a loving caretaker that can help them heal and grow. Please help me provide that for these precious boys.Thank you all for your support and well wishes.Up until the last 7 months, I was a caretaker of Jaxon and Izzy. From bathing and feeding the boys (we love to cook together), to putting them to bed or getting them ready for school-this was my everyday life.As you can see from my Facebook page, I am and have been in their young lives since almost the beginning  and am continuing this to raise these boys TOGTHER and in an environment where they will heal and grow into the men they are meant to be.Your assistance will be greatly appreciated more than you can know.So if this story speaks to you, please send your love and support.My email is jcoutts59@gmail.com if you want to share in the Life to come.Amanda (Hon) and Spencer Okey were married in 2012. For those of you that know Amanda, you\\'re aware of her fun spirit, hilarious laugh, dedication to nursing, and incredible love for Christ. Not to mention, she\\'s head over heels for her husband Spencer- who is ironically the male version of her. Amanda has been of my best friends since elementary school, and I can remember her saying that she has always wanted a large family someday. I don\\'t know if Spencer necessarily wants quite as many children as Amanda does, but I know that he would give her the moon if he could. When Spencer was 19, he became very ill and was diagnosed with leukemia. After 2 years of treatment, Spencer was told that the cancer was gone. He has been cancer free for about 8 years now. (YAY) And while that is terrific news, he has been robbed of the chance to now have children naturally with his wife. Knowing that this could happen, Spencer was allowed to save some of his sperm prior to chemo. Amanda and Spencer are currently looking into invetro fertilization and they been told that they have exactly 2 tries to make a baby. While they have not received an exact quote on the price of this procedure yet, it has been estimated to be about $20,000.Additionally, whether or not it is in God\\'s plan for them to bear children of their own, they have already filed an application for adoption with an agency in Indianapolis. Adopting a child has been part of Amanda and Spencer\\'s plan since the beginning of their marriage and they have agreed to adopt regardless of their own childbearing capabilities. The agency they are going through has quoted them a price of $25,700 to adopt a child in the United States.As their friend, and with their consent, I would like to personally invite anyone to donate to this cause. For those of you that know Amanda and Spencer, you know that they are truly an amazing couple and they deserve the chance to expand their family. They just need a little help from their friends! While donations are helpful, I ask that you please add Spencer and Amanda to your prayer list as we know that God will ultimately direct their path. Thank you!!For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11Dear Friends and Family,Thank you for taking the time to consider supporting us financially as we are on this journey of adoption.In the fall of 2014, in the midst of trying to begin a family of our own, we were faced with the harsh reality of infertility. Even though it was a difficult truth to realize, we felt an overwhelming sense of peace from God. You see, both of us had considered the possibility of adoption before we decided to build our own family. Both of us had sensed a calling from God to open our hearts and home to a child who would otherwise not have a family to call their own. Neither of us realized that this calling could have been placed on our hearts for this very specific time in our lives when we would find out that this was the way that God had intended for us to build our family from the start!We recently relocated to Middleburg, FL to follow God\\'s leading in our lives to become pastors. Once we settledinto our responsibilities and community, we began seeking out an adoption agency that aligned with our beliefs and offered support for both adoptive parents and birth parents. With some research and recommendations from dear friends of ours who have gone through the adoption journey themselves, we settled on Bethany Christian Services of Winter Park, Fl. Bethany is the largest Christian adoption agency in the United States and requires every adoption applicant to be a participating member of a church body. Applicants are also required to provide a testimony of their faith, along with references from their pastor and other church members. On August 1, 2015, we attended an informational meeting that secured our decision to work with this agency.A couple of days later we submitted our formal application and were approved for adoption! Now we are faced with the hefty load of paperwork, doctor\\'s appointments, background tests and reference checks required to continue screening us for adoption. This is all something that we can handle with no problem-Sheena is extremely organized and efficient!However, the financial portion that we must also square away is another story. When we decided to adopt, we were aware of the financial implications, but are now starting to realize the reality of what can quickly become a stressful, and discouraging burden on what should be a hopeful, joyful experience. But after talking with some friends and family who have shared an interest to be supportive to us in any way possible-even financially, we were encouraged to create this fundraising profile.Our obvious goal is to raise a portion of the $25,000 fee that is before us as we seek to adopt our very first child.We are able to apply for adoption grants, butthere is still a good amount that we are required to personally up front. Already we have received a few donations from friends who have felt God calling them to support us in this way-and we are so grateful! Through this fundraising profile, we want to enlarge that territory and allow others who may feel the same call to give from their hearts.Know that we in no way, shape or form, want to pressure our friends and family to give what they do not have. We are blessed beyond measure knowing that you are already supporting us through prayers and encouragement! So we want to ask that you continue to support us in that way, and if you feel led, to consider supporting us financially as well.In order to keep you all abreast of our journey, we have created a blog so that you can follow us throughout the entire process. We want you all to feel a part of this exciting period in our lives as our dearest friends and family. Our Adoption Journey We love you and thank you in advance for all of your support and love.Blesssings!Jeff and SheenaMy brother has been seperared from his son for nine years. His mother took him and left while my brother was at work with no contact information left. He has tryed several times over the years to findout where he was. He was unable to get any information until recently. Justins mother contacted my brother and told him that justin was not able to live with her anymore. It has been discovered thar he has gone through things that are devastating and unimaginable. My brother was informed that unlesss he could care for Justin he would be placed in a group home. They have a court date on may4th to have justin put back in my brothers care finally after all these years apart. The court is four states over. His car would not presently make the trip so he will have to rent one. The cheapest one he could get for the trip will cost an estimated  $300 he also has to have gas and hotel fair because the court date is early morning.  He is presently in school and and working for one of his professors but this only pays enough to pay his bills. I want to see him reunited with his son and see justin get the opportunity to have a normaland loving home. Please help make this possible anything will help. Thank you and god blessWe are adopting!! First, a little back story. Dori and I have been married for 6 years. Ever since marriage was even on the table, we have talked and prayed about our desire to adopt. Medically speaking, the chances of us having our own biological children are basically zero. But, that\\'s OK. God has been preparing our hearts for this a long time. For the first few years of marriage, our options were quite limited in the adoption world-- most agencies require that you be at least 25 years of age and we didn\\'t make the cut for a bit. When we reached the magic age of 25, we began looking into routes of adoption again. We looked into a private agency--went to a few meetings, but decided it wasn\\'t for us at the time. We then went to Clayton County DFCS and began the foster to adopt process. This led us to a state subsidized agency. We were with this program for the last year and a half. In March of this year, before we had a complete home study, we found out that the agency had lost its contract with the state of Georgia and so we would be forced to look elsewhere. Months before those doors closed, we had gotten onto a waiting list at a private adoption agency here in Georgia. After finding out that our agency was closing, we knew we had made the right decision. August has come and gone and we are officially in the adoption processatCovenant Care in Macon, GA. When all is said and done, our adoption costs will be around 19-20k. While this is no small amount, we are confident that it is attainable. We have been busy saving and have already been blessed by many donations. We are thankful to have incredible family and friends beside us along the way.Please be in prayer for us as we continue in this adoptive journey-- it\\'s an emotional roller coaster, but one we are glad to be on!Love,Chris & DoriMost of you all know my brother Jacob and his crazy beautiful wife Jessie! Well they have been working hard on getting me a nephew but they have hit some rough times. Recently, after a few trips to the doctor, Jessie has found out she has endometriosis. I won\\'t dive too deep into the issue but there are operations that can be done that can put off the endometriosis long enough for her toconcieve. They have tried some of them but to no avail, but there is one that is a bit more tried and true. They have spent most of their savings on previous operations and have almost thrown in the towel.... Let\\'s give these kids some support and show them that there are many of us out there who love them and want to see this happen!! Any donation will help, just help in any way you can. Prayers are desired as well.Lance and Marcia are Adopting !Our StoryWe have always loved children- we even met while working together on a childrens ministry outreach. So it has always been our heart\\'s deepest desire to have kids.Early in 2012, we started the process of adopting a baby, completed mountains of paperwork and began waiting for a match.We have prayed every night that God would lead us in His will, and prepare us for the child that He has for our family. After three years  over 1,000 nights  of praying that prayer, we were wondering when, or if, we were going to receive an answer. And then suddenly, we received the call that a birth mother reviewed our profile and chose us to adopt her precious baby boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe NeedFrom the beginning of this process, we knew that this would be a financialflying leapof faith! God has called us to Pastor a small church in a small town with a small income. Along with our ministry work, Marcia works part time as a teacher and Lance works part time at City Hall and we both worka couple of small side jobs as well.Knowing that we did not have the kind of income to fully fund an adoption, we prayed and sought the Lord, and we felt God leading us forward, and His voice telling us to trust in His provision.\\n\\nYour PartnershipWe invite you to join us on this journey first by praying and second with a financial gift, if God leads you to do so. Over the past 3 years, God has wonderfully provided the nearly $8,000 needed to get to this point. The total remaining costs of this adoption will be a little more than $30,000. Our little boy is due June 29th & our agency requires payment prior to placement, so we need to have our funds together soon. Our family will always be very grateful for your prayers and assistancein bringing home our baby boy!With love in our hearts,Lanceand Marcia & Baby Boy Beachem*GOAL*: To RAISE THE REST OF THE FUNDS BY THE END OF JULY.Please SHARE this page and PRAY for Brandon and Lacy!!

I pray God does the same for my neice and nephew!!We are ready to make our family complete and have decided  open adoption is the best option. Understandably, we need  help in bringing a little bundle of joy home. Your donations will help us offset the cost incurred with the adoption process such as home study, legal fees, travel expenses, and advertising. Any donation amount will be so appreciated and welcomed.We are so excited to begin this process and can\\'t wait to make our dream of a child a reality!!BEARD FOR A CAUSE\\nTo Our Family and Friends:\\nWe would like to announce... We are adopting from Ethiopia! \\nIt may be unknown to some of you, but we have been trying to start a family for a few years now. We have not been able to conceive naturally, and in hopes of becoming parents, we attempted infertility treatments and again had no luck. After much consideration, and saving, we have decided to adopt. As many of you may know, adoption is something that can be financially challenging and a very long journey.\\nThis is Adam\\'s BEARD FOR A CAUSE:\\nThrough the generosity of family, friends and anyone that hears our story, we are hoping to raise $5,000.00 to go towards agency and travel expenses through the adoption process.  The first trip, in about a year, includes appearing in court and meeting our child. The second trip, about a month later, is when everything is finalized and we get to bring our child home! \\nIn an effort to raise these needed funds, Adam has decided to grow his beard for 1 year. With a donation of $10 or more we would like to send you a bracelet in appreciation of your generosity.  We will also be hosting a \"Shave it off Party\" in February of 2014 in Tinley Park, IL for all those who donate to our cause.  Please email us with your address at AKarli22@gmail.com or Kim.Karli21@gmail.com so we can send you your bracelet. \\nWe will continually update photos, so you can see the progress of Adam\\'s beard.\\nThank you to everyone for your support.  We are happy to keep all of you informed throughout the process and let you know of the progress of our adoption. \\nLove, \\nAdam and KimRobb and I met 8 years ago and weve been happily married for 3 years. We quickly fell in love and have been inseparable ever since. From the beginning we knew that we were meant to be parents and have a family. As some of you may know, weve experienced a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the past 3 years of trying to start our family. Our saga consists of 4 miscarriages, 3 surgeries, countless tests, and more heart break than one could ever imagine. We have been working with a fertility specialist for the past 2 years, who has helped guide us, support us, and at times be brutally honest with us. At this point there is no medical reason why my body will not sustain a pregnancy. On paper, both Robb and I are healthy 32yr olds, which has made understanding our battle even more difficult. During our pregnancies we were able to see 2 of our babies heartbeats. Talk about breathtaking moments, we felt over whelming joy and excitement. One pregnancy was over before it really even started. There was no time to be excited or plan. The 4th pregnancy was a tubal pregnancy that called for emergency surgery. All of our losses have been heartbreaking and traumatizing in their own way. I cannot begin to describe the emotions and feelings that are connected to a miscarriage. At times we felt as though we would never be able to get through it, we couldnt sleep, eat, or function, and other times it felt like a cruel joke was being played on us. The one thing that both Robb and I want more than anything was in our hands, only to be stolen away and ripped from our grasp.One might think that with all of our loss, struggles, and sorrow we would be bitter and angry. Anger and bitterness is a choice, and it is something we choose not to be. We have chosen to continue to love one another endlessly, and continue to support one another in our endeavors. Robb and I have grown and learned so much in the past 3years. We have weathered the storm, and have been led to the bright light of adoption. Our struggles have taught us that there is more than one way to be parents, and more than one way to have a family. We know that the road of adoption can be a bumpy one and that we will face many obstacles. Domestic infant adoption can range between $20-30 thousand dollars. We know that we could wait upwards of 2 years to be placed with our sweet baby, along with many trainings, educational classes, assessments, and endless amounts of paper work to be filled out and completed. We are ready to accept this challenge. We are willing to do what is necessary to fulfill our dreams.We are so blessed to be surrounded by such amazing people in our lives. We would not have even considered adoption if not for the encouragement of our friend and family. We have saved, cut corners, made sacrifices and have been able to start the process on own thus far. However, due to extensive medical bills coming in from infertility treatments and surgery from our last loss, we are unable to fund the whole adoption ourselves. We humbly and graciously ask for the support of our family and friends in our attempts to fund our adoption. We know that everyone is not in a place to donate financially, we would be ever so grateful for prayers and positive energy being sent our way. If you are moved to donate, any bit helps, we would be eternally thankful. We know that we have what it takes to be amazing parents, and we know that we have a foundation of amazing people in our lives to help, support, encourage, and raise out little one. We look so forward to the day that we can bring our baby home and introduce him/her to everyone that helped make our dreams of a family come true.Thank you so much for the encouragement and love that has been given to us though out the past 3 years. We could not ask for a better team to raise a child in. Thank you for having our backs emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Lets bring Baby Crane home!Hi, I\\'m Erienne Murray.  My husband Nick and I have been together almost 8 years and have been married for 2 and a half of those 8 years. More than anything in the world, we want to be parents. Unfortunately it\\'s not as easy as it sounds.  I have been a type 1 diabetic for 20 years. Due to my diabetes, and the complications that come from having diabetes, it is not safe or healthy for me to carry a baby. I have progressing kidney disease and ongoing vision loss. I am currently on a kidney/pancreas transplant list. It is possible I could have my transplant in the next year and if everything were to go well, it would greatly improve my quality of life. Even though we have a lot on our plate, we don\\'t want to put our lives on hold and lose sight of our greatest wish, to be parents. So we have had to think of alternative ways to make this happen. Our sister-in-law, DeAnne, has offered to be a surrogate for us, which is amazing and this offering alone makes us feel very blessed!! However, the IVF and surrogacy process does not come on the cheap, especially when insurance doesn\\'t cover anything. We\\'ve decided to reach out and tell our story, in hopes of helping with the costs. Thank you so much for your time! We know not everyone is able to donate money so thoughts and prayers are equally appreciated!!As many of you know, Ray and I have been trying to get pregnant for a while. We tried on our own for almost four years. In June 2012 we went to the doctor. After many tests, procedures and lots of blood work we were told our only hope to get pregnant would be IVF (in-vitro fertilization). They gave us the brochure with the prices. He told us the total at the clinic alone would be $11,500. This price did not include medications, which can run anywhere from $3,500-$7,000. Sadly, infertility is not something covered by insurance. We were disappointed, but we were determined to have a family. I had surgery in August 2012 to clear my endometriosis. After surgery I began a medication to keep my endometriosis from coming back for 6 months. Shortly after this medication we finally got the news we would be starting the actual IVF medication.In late February 2013 I began the IVF medication. It was a strict regimen of multiple shots and pills. We did our egg retrieval and embryo transfer in March 2013. They were able to retrieve 4 eggs from me. After fertilization however, we only had one surviving embryo. We were a little discouraged, but as they say, \"It only takes one\". Two weeks after embryo transfer we got the blood work back that we were pregnant and my numbers were extremely high, so twins were a possibility!! We were so happy. Two weeks after my initial blood work is when our first ultrasound was scheduled. Patty, the ultrasound technician, immediately found the heartbeat. It was strong and she was very pleased. I asked her if she saw another baby because my beta levels were extremely high. She said no. She started to end the session when she made the discovery of TWIN B!! \"AHH! The embryo split, we now are having identical twins!\" was all I remember saying. At this point, we were over the moon with joy. After all this time, we were going to get two sweet babies to love!One week later was our next ultrasound. Twin A\\'s heartbeat was good and strong. Unfortunately, Twin B did not make it. We were sad, but very happy we still had a baby coming our way in November 2013.Everything was going great. We graduated out of Nashville Fertility Center and onto regular prenatal care. We had an ultrasound at 10 weeks and baby was doing great. On May 30th (about 14 weeks) an ER doctor did an ultrasound for me. There was nothing wrong; I just wanted to see my baby. I work in an ER, so he was happy to do one for me. The heartbeat was good, baby touched its face. I got to see the feet and toes. It was amazing.Our appointment to find out the gender was set for Saturday June 8th. We were so excited. This was going to be huge, after waiting for so long, we would finally know boy or girl! I laid down and the ultrasound technician started moving the wand over my belly. Baby was sleeping and it was looking as if we were not going to be finding out the sex, because baby was not turning. She had me bounce on a ball to wake baby up. When she tried again, she said that she was having a hard time finding the heartbeat. She said it may be the position. She recommended we call our doctor, get checked out, and we could reschedule the gender appointment.I called the doctor on call and he said we need to go to the ER and get a proper ultrasound. I called the charge nurse at Vandy and she had a room waiting for us. After telling the triage nurse what happened, she hugged me and said she was sorry. Immediately this caused panic in Ray, because I don\\'t think he realized what was happening. I think in the back of my mind I knew, but I was not going to give up hope yet. The doctor came in and did a portable ultrasound. He was unable to find the heartbeat. He said he was going to order a formal ultrasound. Patient transport took us to ultrasound and the waiting was killing us. When she began, she was very quiet. She only asked us to tell the story. I tell her the shortest version possible and she was still quiet. After she took about 15 images of the baby, I asked her, \"You can\\'t find the heartbeat either, can you?\". Our entire future was hanging on her response and then she finally said \"No, I can\\'t find the heartbeat.\"We were heartbroken. Devastation is a light description of what we were feeling. We woke up that morning prepared to go pick out paint colors for the room and just like that our baby was gone. The OB resident came in and gave us our options. We chose to be induced and deliver our baby. I was admitted to labor and delivery around 10pm. At 11pm, I was given the first dose of medication to induce me. I was given my second dose at 3am and another at 7am. I was having contractions, but not as many as they would have liked. Around 10am, the doctors came in and said they would like to try one of two options to speed things along. I told them, they could choose, whichever they feel would be best. I\\'ll spare you of all the gory details, but after a painful hour of trying the first method, they opted to try the second method. The second method immediately worked and the contractions began coming much more frequently. I received my epidural around 7:30 pm. This eased my pain quite a bit. At 9:17pm, I delivered a sweet baby boy. He was so little and frail. We held him and loved on him. I sang him a song and Ray talked to him. The nurse took him away briefly to prepare us some mementos that included pictures, hats, booties, wristbands, and a card with his name, time of birth, height, and weight. We named him Raymond Stanley, after Ray and my late grandfather. We said our goodbyes and told him we loved him one last time. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing we\\'ve ever had to do. After all the pain, stress, heartache, and disappointment we are still hopeful to have our family. We have decided to try IVF again. Unfortunately with my endometriosis, we must start the process much sooner than we would like. If we wait too long, medicine will not keep my endometriosis away and I will have to have surgery. With that being said we are asking for your help. Our last cycle of IVF cost us a little under $20,000 after everything was said and done. We paid the last cycle with our savings, two HSA\\'s, money from Ray\\'s mom, money borrowed from my Nonny, and the rest on zero interest credit cards. We know that times are hard and understand if you can\\'t donate, but we ask that you please share our story with your friends and family. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also, prayers are so important to us too. We thank you in advance for your help; your contribution means more than you will ever know. With Love and Thanks, Ray and DevinHello! We are the Laban\\'s! My name is Niki and I would like to introduce a little bit about my husband Tom and myself. Our story started 6 years ago in September 2008, when we married. Tom joined the United States Navy in November 2008. HOME is where the NAVY takes us, which currently is Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After we were married we decided we immediately wanted to start a family. We tried for a few years without success and decided to attempt fertility treatments. We went through several years of different types of treatment without success. We decided to stop fertility treatments and look into adoption. In 2010, shortly after making the decision to stop treatment we met a young girl who was looking to make an adoption plan for her baby. We met with her and immediately bonded, she made the decision to choose us to raise her baby. Little did any of us know at the time, she was pregnant with twins. Unfortunately at 20 weeks she went into preterm labor and delivered our twin boys, Eli Thomas and Hunter Luke. Due to their extreme prematurity they passed away shortly after birth. We were completely devastated, our hearts were shattered. We took a few years to grieve and then decided we wanted to consider fertility treatments again. We tried a new treatment and again we were faced with no success. In 2013 a friend of ours told us a story about a young mother who was pregnant and considering adoption for her baby. We began talking to this courageous girl, giving her support and encouragement. A few weeks before she was due, she let us know that she was going to parent instead of place her baby with us. We were saddened to learn of this but supported her decision. We were thankful she even considered choosing us to raise her baby. After careful evaluation of our situation and mourning the loss of Eli and Hunter as well as a failed adoption, we have decided to try adoption again. We recently started working with an adoption consultant and are extremely excited with their dedication and determination to make our dreams come true. We are excited but extremely nervous of the costs involved. We never realized how expensive working with an agency would cost. Unfortunately, insurance does not cover adoption fees. Due to our extenuating circumstances of living on a secluded military base overseas, and the difficult task of adopting while living here our consultant has suggested we begin our efforts by asking our family and friends to consider helping us make our dream a reality. We prayerfully ask that you consider helping us in our effort to raise money. Over the next year and a half we plan to hold several fundraiser events, save as much as we can, and live as frugally as possible. We have set a goal to raise at least half of the cost by the time we return the the United States in hopes that we can start growing our family immediately. So, as much as we really dislike asking for help this is what we are doing. Anything will help, there is no amount too small or too large. Even if you cannot afford to donate please consider sharing this link with family and friends. Networking is our biggest advantage to sucess!! Thank you all so very, very much for taking the time to review our cause and helping us achieve our dreams of growing our family.Follow along on our blog for updates:  http://2008labanslately.blogspot.com/Hello. My name is Mike Rizka. Thepicture above is ofmy uncle Fawzi Noureddine. He isa loving husband and the father of 5 children with a heart of gold. Anyone that knows him knows that he always has a smile on his face. He has been fighting an aggressive cancer for many years and a months after he was told hemay bebeating the cancer, he waspart of an accident involving 7 vehicles including cars, semi trucks, and a bus.For the last month, hehas not had a smile on his facebecause heisin a coma with severetrama to his brain and we are told that the cancer is back in multiple areas of his body.The hospitalwas able to get him off life support and now they want to send him to a rehabilation center where he will have 24 hour care while in a coma. His insurance is refusing to pay for the long-term care and rehabilitaion required. If we can\\'t raise the money for his medical bills, he will be sent home in a coma with no professional care. All donations will be used for his medical expenses. Please include him in your prayers as we strongly believe that prayer is the strongest healer.We are The LaBerges from King, NC and we are hoping you can help us grow our family! We met in high school and have been together ever since. Our marriage took place in may of 2008 and that is when our true adventure began. We knew we wanted to have children pretty soon into our marriage after being together for so long, so immediately following my first year of graduate school, we got started :) After our first few years of really putting our all into it with no success, we thought perhaps we were just unlucky. After all, we are beyond blessed! Maybe it just wasn\\'t our time right? After another year of prayer, fasting, & more prayer, we decided we should seek help. 8 months of conservative and non- invasive procedures with our fabulous Obgyn, we still ended the party with a goose egg. That\\'s right....zilch. Ronnie and I decided we would take my doctors advice and have an IVF consult with a center in Charlotte. At first they seemed so sympathetic and understanding. They were certain they could help us have a baby! No problem they said, you both are young and healthy, this is going to be the easiest IVF session we\\'ve ever done they said. We were on cloud nine! This is really happening we thought! We are really going to have a baby!!!!Then the price tag came. $20,000 didn\\'t sound so terrible when you look at the end result right? We swallowed hard, took their medicine, went through the very stressful procedure, and yep....you guessed it. Our family still only has two members. They were left scratching their heads...as were we, but then no compassion, sympathy, here\\'s our next step or anything. We were told we would be refunded a portion of our money but after six months of battle, we got apporox $200 back. That was only when we expressed an interest to have another session.So we ended up in the wonderful hands of Wake Forest with Dr Johnston and Dr Yalcinkaya. We decided to see if they could help. After another $20,000, we felt so blessed to get extremely far along in the process. We had 2 fantastic embryos that formed out of 19 eggs pulled. We decided to place both embryos, but sadly they didn\\'t implant into the womb.We are initiating our 3rd try for a LaBerge baby in January. After our last conversation with Dr Johnston, she feels like with a couple of medication changes, we can do this :) We feel overwhelmingly blessed by our Heavenly Father to have had the means and love and support to have went through this process twice. We are hoping that you will be able to share your love and support with us for our third round to achieve our ultimate goal.... A complete family! Your generosity is beyond appreciated... And if you can\\'t donate, please leave a note of encouragement and do something nice for someone that can use your love :)Our adoption journey thus far has been amazing!!! Yes it\\'s had its ups and downs but we would not trade one moment of our journey!! We have been with the same agency for over 2 years and we have gone through 4 failed matches during this time! We can honestly say God brought us through the rough times and we trusted His plan without questioning Him. His timing is always perfect!!!! He has been leading us to change our direction for a few months now but we were hesitant because the new direction would cost more money!! (We must have forgotten He owns a cattle on a thousand hills) He finally got our attention when we got our 4th confirmation that we are suppose to go with Faithful Adoption Consultants!!! Faithful Adoption Consultants work with agencies and lawyers in safe states across the U.S., and the average wait for a baby is 4.5 months...since we are wanting to adopt minority (because true love sees no color) and the average wait for minority is 2 months!!!!!  We are around$12,000 short of our goal!!!  I know it seems like such a mountain and believe me, we have stared the mountain down, but Ava Grace says it only takes a little faith!!! We have been blessed with an abundance of love, prayers, support, and financial blessings from our family, AMAZING church family, and friends the last 2-1/2 years, and for that we are GRATEFUL!!! We just want to say a HUGE thank you to everyone that has encouraged us and supported us on this wild ride!!! We would just ask you all to continue to pray, as we go in this new direction, that He will keep His hand on the precious baby, that He chooses for us until we hold him/her in our arms. Please also pray that He blesses our efforts to raise money and that it happens FAST!!! Every penny brings us closer!!! So here\\'s to fundraising again...It will all be worth it!!! We cannot wait to hold our little miracle...Some of you may know our story, but for those of you that don\\'t we would like to share it with you. We are high school sweethearts and have been together since the young age of 14. After graduating from college, we were married at the age of 23. After our first year of marriage we began trying to have our first baby. We have dreamed of having a large family for a very long time. After more than a year of our unsuccessful attempts, we saw a doctor. Becca was diagnosed with PCOS in 2011. At that point we were referred to a Reproductive Endocrinologist, also known as an RE. Our RE did testing and bloodwork and confirmed that Becca does in fact have PCOS (or Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome), but the news didn\\'t end there. In addition to the PCOS, she is also insulin resistant. At this point, our RE wanted to check Donny for any obstacles as well. That\\'s when we discovered the hits just kept coming. In addition to all of the obstacles we are facing with Becca, Donny was diagnosed with a low sperm and low motility count.With this heart breaking news, we had to decide on our next plan of action. With the guidance of our RE, we chose IUI(intrauterine insemanation). Insurance would not cover any medical expenses for our fertility treatments, so we saved and saved and saved. In November of 2012, we went in for our first IUI and two weeks later we discovered it did not take. We held our heads high and started saving for round two! In December 2012, we completed our second round of IUI and with every prayer and wish we hoped for a positive test on Christmas, but it wasn\\'t our time. Round three of IUI took place in February 2013, and with little faith we waited. The moment we\\'d been waiting for finally came when Becca tested positive for pregnancy! We were over the moon with excitement and called our RE immediately. The next morning we received devastating news. The bloodwork showed we were in fact pregnant, but that the numbers were not increasing and we would most likely lose our baby. About two weeks later and after constant bloodwork, Becca miscarried. We refused to give up and our wonderful RE had no attentions of failure. Our next option was Superovulation IUI(orIUI with injectables). First step, Becca would undergo day surgery to confirm that she was a good candidate for this procedure. The surgery went smoothly, however, Donny was a nervous wreck the entire time. We are still paying for the cost of this day surgery.Onceour RE confirmed that this was the next best step for us we decided to go for it. Superovulation IUI cost a considerable amount more, so after more and moresaving, in August of 2013 we finally had the money for round FOUR.We thoughtthe IUI\\'s were a lot to handle, butboy were we wrong. Afteran instructional class and scheduling our date, Becca began giving her selfshots daily for two weeks (which was considerably scarier than we thought it would be). She went in every 48-72 hours for bloodwork and ultrasounds. The day finally came for our fourth IUI and the procedure wentsmoothly.With prayers and wishes and sleepless nights we waited and waited. After possibly the longest two weeks of our lives, our hearts were crushed...again. Becca was not pregnant. We are devasted. We did it right, we dated for years, graduated from college, got married, have dogs to love and our dream jobs. But we still feel incomplete. After spending thousands of dollars on our previous procedures and still coming up with empty arms we are asking for your help. We would love the chance to have In Vitro Fertilization. Our dream of having a baby is a far stretch and we can\\'t do it on our own. In Vitro Fertilization cost approximately $13,000. Insurance does not cover a single penny. We are saving but it\\'s hard on our own. Our prides aren\\'t too big to ask for your assistance in reaching our goal. Any amount would help. Would you please donate to us for a chance to help us fill our home and our hearts with the blessing of a baby? In addition, we ask that you pray. Pray for us, pray for our family. Prayer is power and we have no doubt our Lord\\'s plan for us to become parents will happen. With all our love,Donny & BeccaOur Story,Amanda and I have been married for just over 4 years and the time has flown by. We have always been an active and busy couple, working hard and participating in the many activities we are involved in. Although we feel abundantly blessed with each other and or wonderful friends and family, there is still apart of us that doesnt feel whole. Amanda and I have been trying to start a family for a little over 3 years with no such luck. We have spent over $15,000 in fertility drugs and appointments, unfortunately none of which is covered by our medical insurance. Doctors have diagnosed Amanda with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), meaning she doesnt ovulate on her own which causes her to get cysts on her ovaries which are usually very painful. We have decided to take the next step in infertility which is In vitro Fertilization (IVF). Many of you might be asking yourself, what is IVF? IVF is the joining of a woman\\'s egg and a man\\'s sperm in a laboratory dish. In vitro means outside the body, fertilization means the sperm has attached to and entered the egg. Sounds crazy and expensive right? IVF has roughly a 62% success right, which depending on your point of view, might seem like pretty good odds or not so good odds at all. Coming from our point of view 62% of a chance to have a little one is far better than what our odds look like without doing IVF. In the past, Amanda had been taking Clomid and Metformin shots which were supposed to help with ovulation induction. The success rate for those shots are at 20%. We tried what they called cycles numerous times without any luck and, at $800-1200 a cycle, the bills added up quickly. This brings us to where we are at now- instead putting money towards pills and shots we have decided to try IVF. The price for one round of IVF is different for every patient. For Amanda and me they have estimated the cost to be between $13,000-$20,000 which absolutely zero is covered by insurance and is ALL due by your first appointment. The $13,000-$20,000 we will be financing on our own, what we would like to ask help for is the 5-$10,000 it will cost for medications and two separate procedures called HSG and a SIS/TET. These two procedures Amanda will be having this Thursday and Friday and will help the doctors determine if her tubes are clear and healthy for when they transfer they embryo. The whole process from start to finish usually takes two months. With that all being said we know it is just a 62% chance, and we are fine with that. We are putting it into Gods hands and praying for the best. What we do have going for us is the Doctors have never told us we CANT have a baby and that gives us hope!  There are thousands of couples going through the exact thing my wife and I are. Its almost like we have a disease which we are ashamed of, hiding behind every questing that is asked of when are you having kids!? dont worry, its not your fault for asking! Its ours for not being upfront! It is a very stressful situation that we hide behind. We have decided to share our story and ask for help.. no more hiding and no more feeling like we are different. Dont be scared to ask us about it, we are coming forward and it will help us with the process along the way! Taking this step of putting our story out there has been a very hard decision to make; we are both very hard working and independent people who are proud of what we have. In order to do this we realize that we need all the help we can get. Thank you for taking the time to read our story. We know many of you are in as difficult of times as we are so thank you in advance for your support. Whether it is through prayers or donations we truly appreciate it. Even if you are not able to donate please show your support by clicking to share our story with those you know.Our precious son drowned last June. He was barely 2 years old. I found out I was pregnant about a week later. This pregnancy has been incredibly emotional and difficult, but I am trying to grieve properly and heal through it. Since Eli passed away, I have associated water with death and fear. Through Olivia\\'s birth, I hope to find healing and be able to associate water with new life. Insurance will only cover a portion of this birth. Please help us by donating whatever you can.Helloour family and friends. It\\'s Valerie and Daniel :) As you all might know, we have been desperately trying to have a baby on our own for the last 9 years, but to no avail. We\\'ve tried everything and every doctor we know. We\\'ve decided to pursue adoption and we are inviting you to join us on our journey to get that lil bundle of joy in our lives. We can\\'t wait!! All proceeds will go directly to adopting Baby Ontiveros!This account is to support baby Norah and her parents Clark and Heather Tarwater. To allow them to care for her full time.Norah Hope Tarwater was born at 23 weeks weighing 1 lb 4oz. She will need to be in the hospital for at least the next 4 months. As of last night her vitals were stable, we will try and keep you informed on here as to her condition. Norah is now at Cook\\'s Children\\'s Hospital. Please continue to pray for Clark, Heather, and Baby Norah as this will be a long road ahead of them.~ Ephesians 3:20 - Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us ~Below is a link to Clark and Heather\\'s Blog where they will be posting updates. https://norahhopetarwater.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/our-beautiful-girl/Below picture is before she went to Cook\\'s Hospital.
